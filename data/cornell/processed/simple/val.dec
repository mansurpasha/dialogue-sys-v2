<number> hours . 
oh , yes , sir . very much . and i want to thank you -- 
i like it too . it 's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex . it can be a natural , zesty enterprise . but unfortunately there are some people -- it is called satyriasis in men , nymphomania in women -- who engage in it compulsively and without joy . 
i had a temper . 
i liked the dog , for laughs .

i knew by your nervousness that <person> was n't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass . 
i need the job . 
try again , c'mon , try again . 
he causes problems . he was here earlier . 
can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in <number> piece ? 
no . but he needs treatment . 
it is ? 
that 's right . 
no . i said i liked <person> to use his hands . i do n't give any rules , <person> . i go with the flow . 
hold it . you never said anything about a wife , frozen or otherwise- 
i will . see you . 
he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last <number> weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ? 
no jean , no money ! 
who the hell is this `` they ? '' 
not at all -- 
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day . my niece , she 's cured up , and i got you to thank . 
weird . like after all those years you would remem -- 
i do not know -- and even if i did ... 
good eye . not <number> club owner got it . they all ask me why i got <person> <person> on my card . 
i know , <person> . 
if you do n't let go , <person> <person> , we 'll both die . 
nlr , we think . i wan na know ... 
it worked , did n't it ? 
i 'm out . 
sounds good . how do you know where i live ? 
oh , no , that 's all gone . 
what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to <person> <person> and then induced him to make love ? 
it does n't neccessarily matter . they do n't even know who those people are , and even if they did , they have nothing to connect them with us , nothing at all . 
yeah , but we 're -- 
i 'd like just some sign i can trust you too , <person> . i do n't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me . some sight ... right ? 
either you 're a liar or you are a fool . 
to avenge his father , and the others . 
well then let us proceed . 
both . 
how large is your brood ? 
fact . <person> <person> performed at a consistently mediocre level . fact . he made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit ... fact . he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit . fact . <person> <person> lied to his employers , going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them . fact . he was successful in his duplicity . the partners at wyant wheeler did < u > not < /u > know <person> <person> had aids when they fired him ... 
normal . <person> . 
you been on the farm for quite a spell , have n't you ? 
having it cleaned did n't help , huh ? 
this is a school ... that 's a student 's work . she 'll be ready to become an apprentice soon . then , in thirty or forty years , she 'll take her place among the artisans ... 
you 're concentrating awfully hard considering it 's gym class . 
i love you , man ! 
then we 're all in a lot of trouble . 
you 're not my type . 
two-hundred dollars . . . that 's how i put a price on murder . 
the zionists are n't <person> . 
what ? 
you ca n't trust those guys . 
no , he never told me about his friends . would you like some tea ? 
nobody really wears that stuff , paloma . 
and where exactly does that put your position ... ? 
she did ? 
look , even if by some miracle <person> is conscience , his muscles would be totally useless . give the troopers a chance to search . 
but surely you must know -- because i love you . 
no . <person> . looking forward to it . cut to : 
ai n't nuthin ' wrong wit ' it . 
only flowers i wan ' see 's <number> 's over my peaceful self restin ' in the dutty . 
i ca n't know things if you do n't tell me . 
is n't that french for something ? 
i ca n't tell you the whole story . i. i took it upon myself . i ca n't say more . 
i have n't killed _you_ . 
what a pity ! educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch . everything stops . and the doctor ? he worships your father , too ? 
kinda tough on the butt . 
assumptions are always ... 
well , i do n't know . i 'm actually on my way to ... 
oh please , <person> ... do n't even think it . you 're the only person who ever ... it 's just ... ca n't you wait for me ? 
yes ? 
no ! them ! shoot them ! cross the beams . 
she gave me the evil eye . 
... central ... intelligence ... <person> ... 
it 's me . i 'll call you tomorrow , sweetheart . go back to sleep . i love you ... 
who cares ? 
no , no , doolittle , you talk to it . teach it phenomenology , doolittle . 
you know , <person> -- do n't get mad , okay ? - - but , i 'd just be lost without you . 
a brothel . 
entert-ain ... us ... an-us ... oh yeah ! heh heh . <person> . heh heh . 
could you believe <person> <person> ? 
here with you . 
little village down <number> . supposed to be charming . 
me too . 
gaiijin ? 
well , you have to learn . it 'll take some time . do n't you know anybody down there to help you out ? 
actually , it did n't come from me . 
i heard voices . 
nothing . i said nothing . 
i got a friend at a lab . i could get the whole thing blown-up , enhanced -- 
in the next <number> minutes ? 
yes , sir . 
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system ... our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness , which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo . 
oh no ... 
no . 
a gat ! a gat ! got any fireworks on you ? 
there 's nothing to see . 
to reach people , you have to feel something first ... you write about the wrong things . how can you feel for dog food ? the people at the gazette do n't respect it , and neither do you . 
no . he was my brother . he died at anothers hand . 
well , that 's my poor upbringing . i did n't go to no private school . i have n't got no class . i want to live with a writer . not a fucking croupier . i do n't even know what the word means . croupier . 
how 's that ? 
it is your evil , who will be sought by us . 
i do n't know . 
i think you 're the greatest . but my dad says you do n't work hard enough on defense . 
what are you doing here , i thought you were a nazi . 
but it look like a man . it ... i saw it . 
shit . 
how did you ... ? 
uh-huh . my nephew 's going to be staying with us in a few months , so i stopped by . 
you 're a fool . 
either that or she 'll be in jail . 
shhh ! i heard you the first time . 
what 's that ? 
he knows that ? <person> ? 
like hell it is ! 
<number> or <number> ... 
yeah , let 's check out the low-life . 
i 'll call you then . 
do you sing and dance ? 
heart to heart ? woman to woman ? including a casual reference to the part of `` cora '' - and your hopes of playing it . 
well , you do n't have to get nasty about it . 
my god . you 've got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . where is she ? 
very well , proceed , sir . 
it 's not bad . 
i thought this was a group effort . 
did n't know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe . 
say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ... 
he knows some english , but he ca n't not speak it good like we do . 
<person> ? 
is that what you want me to do ? put it all on <person> ? let him sort it out in the afterlife ? 
i know ... but sometimes i get scared this is as good as it 's gon na get ... 
if it had n't been for me , you would be dead . 
try the emergency channels ... 
<number> thousand bucks . 
most natural thing in the world ! 
then there 's you , <person> , sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go . i 'm actually a pretty amazing person -- funny , smart , attractive when i get my sleep -- but you <number> had no way of knowing that -- when i met you both i was basically a morose , depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling . the only reason <number> of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew i was <person> . 
<person> j. giron . 
what 's this supposed to mean : `` we have a contract of depravity . all we have to do is pull the blinds down . '' 
i 've got a reason far beyond confidence : my wife is having our firstborn in <number> months and i promised i 'd be with her when the baby comes . 
i want to talk now . 
wait a minute - i told you i did n't do nothing wrong ! 
okay ... i promise . 
the lake was dead calm until up he came . the tooth is in there . 
uh-huh . 
they 're putting themselves in place of this kid 's parents and thinking they 'd want to hear their girl 's okay , even if that 's all they hear . 
all things considered , yes . even if it was n't what i dreamt of then ... 
so it seems . 
ah . 
austin , i have something for you as well . 
then , goodbye . 
donnie ! give it back ! 
i wish you 'd give it a try . 
be fair , oona . 
what ? 
i told you . she kills him . 
does this sound strange to you ? 
precisely , <person> . greek for the herd . however , be warned that , when you say `` the hoi polloi '' you are actually saying the the herd . indicating that you too are `` hoi polloi . '' 
<person> <person> , his technical assistant . you 'll join <person> and the others -- 
if this magazine is so important to you <person> , why are you in montana ? 
she 'll talk about pms and stare at her salad . 
sobering ... 
you promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains ? 
she 's asian . they do n't have <person> in asia . 
i ... uh ... i think she 's doing fine on her own . 
they 're liars and cowards . 
'mary rooney , forty-nine . lives in arlington , still working at the hospital . ' can you get out tomorrow ? how come she is n't speaking up . 
i go home and paint the kitchen . 
oh . i thought ... you said you 'd been to so many in <number> days ... what was it you wanted to ask ? 
i think she 's acting . i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . i think maybe she 's upset that he did n't ... 
oh . 
eh ... police . 
excuse me . 
i was just leaning on it ! it was an accident ! 
where 's who ? 
murder ! 
yes ... it 's magic . 
i saw you go up from the knecker , working that <person> , learning the barnard 's law and i thought , `` the kid 's a prodigy . '' but i know that if you 're using these goods ... so then i figure , what 's worth that ? you 're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund . who 's the <person> ? 
yes . yes . we 'll work something out . i swear to god . wo n't we j.d. ? ... j.d . ? 
i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine , and you could tell me what you think . 
god i guess i 'll have to introduce you now . 
<person> liked it . 
i know that 's what it looks like , but it 's not . i ca n't logically explain to you why it 's not . <person> believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed . i understand that now . that 's why i have to go . 
what if he wants to get out ? 
no jeremy . 
i do n't know . it 's <number> of the things i thought of . 
take care of me ? 
i want you to remember if you can a night last january . the night <person> <person> died . do you remember . 
i 'm sorry , he 's on medication ... 
thank you , ma'am ... 
it 's still a good idea . 
huh ? 
jennifer , you want to have another drink ? 
i 'm sure you 're not . 
yes , sir . 
maybe you oughta give me lessons . 
so what ? 
she sure does . 
reverend edwards . <person> <person> . you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year . 
i do n't know . yesterday . sunday . 
did n't you say that they 're going to develop this revolutionary new thing ... 
how 's the fungus around your thumbnail ? 
i can give you <number> . you did n't do very much to these . 
i love you , austin . 
i am trying to keep emotions out of this . even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject . 
look kid , i know what it 's like , i was a kid , too . even stole a horse once . but you ca n't -- 
yes . 
go ahead . 
it just takes time , <person> . it 's gon na get better . 
you are home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , i 'll be your point person here on the magazine . 
-- you only got the job because both you and <person> went to yale -- 
well , that 's great . 
well , maybe i could just start a rumor , then . 
what ? 
sure . they want me back in so i wo n't break in ! they < i > still < /i > ca n't figure out how we did it . 
damn right . and there 's still a helluva lotta people out there who wan na believe ... that 's the point , is n't it ? they wan na believe in the president . 
no , i did n't . 
yes . i have been seeking my friends . 
you 're lint ! you 're a flea ! you 're a blip ! 
<person> down . 
can i come in ? 
pretty much the same . 
how 'd you get around the tap orders ? 
if he was able , what would he say . 
he said , sing the devil away ! 
skipper ... 
at first it was , but now it 's become something bigger . 
i know , i need a keeper . 
our e.p.s . was <number> fifty last quarter . we 're up <number> cents per share . 
timmy ! do as he says ! <person> ! do as dr. grant says , quick ! 
look closely , <person> , it 's time you did . i am <person> dewitt . i 'm nobody 's fool . least of all - yours . 
i guess i did . 
that 's always tough . how long were you together ? 
you 're only screwing yourselves over ! helllllp ! helllllp ! somebody ! ! ! 
outrageous , merv . nice to be here . i feel great . 
i 'm just here with another girl . 
belong - to you ? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama ... 
what are you talking about ? 
i 'm used to it . 
so much for friends , then . you 're a bitter bastard , <person> , you know that ? 
she 's a catholic . she says it would put her soul in peril . <person> is a very serious sin , apparently . 
was n't that cowardice ? 
i do n't know anything ! 
you mean you 'd like me to do it , huh ? 
it 's only <number> days . 
tch ... how romantic . yeah . if i was n't already committed to lydia , boy . except <person> 'd never go for me though . she loves you too much . and you really love her , huh ? 
how did you meet ? 
after i saw what <person> did with the role -- you know i fired all my people , went into rehab , took acting classes , changed my whole look . she really inspired me . 
so what do we do with the device ? 
you 're not gon na marry him , <person> . do you love him , <person> ? 
i 'll be right in the other room , newt . and look ... i can see you on that camera right up there .

int . u.s. research laboratory/long 's office - night . 
she never ate a slice . 
man and boy . 
what do you mean about caring ? have you ever seen <number> of those places ? inside ? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you ... and my mother there ? why ? has she harmed you ? she 's as harmless as ... <number> of these stuffed birds . 
they open a window . 
yes . 
are you jody ? 
what ? 
hold still , damn it ! 
left behind ? 
come with me . 
you fucking liar ! 
you know that 's bullshit . 
it 's still impressive by my standards : my name 's <person> . 
jesus . <number> and it must be ninety already . 
you know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship ? a <number> little things like this ... 
i 'm not talkin ' about your damn word , <person> . <person> , what the heck 're you ? ... well , look , i do n't want to cut you out of the loop , but his here 's a good deal . i assume , if you 're not innarested , you wo n't mind if we move on it independently . 
try calling me again . 
and the pony ? 
'cause you like their second <number> , you said , <person> , <person> . etc . the one with <person> <person> on the cover . you did n't see the cover though . 
what does that mean ? 
what are you talking about ? 
yeah , i asked him . i do n't want nobody in there , nobody spending good money in sal 's . he should get no mo ' money from the community till he puts some black faces up on that motherfucking wall . 
what flickering light ? 
that 's all we need . 
sure , man -- 
just be warned , that things are n't always as they seem ... especially the starforce recruiting posters . 
thanks anyway . 
you better win a hand -- you 're on a blitz . 
nice way to help a colleague in trouble . 
yes . do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time ! 
who said anything about brooms ? 
hell of a day , <person> . yankees are on fire . 
benjamin , do n't you ever take that girl out . 
and the passage to the barn ? 
who is it ? 
ssshh ... everything 's gon na be okay . i promise . 
he insulted me first . he called me a moron . 
aside from the obvious ? 
i 've been with him since i got out of school . he brought me into the cmdf , over <number> years ago . 
yeow ! 
... -ty . 
why do n't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all ? 
he 's getting big . <person> , come here and sit down for a minute . 
why is it just lying there ? why does n't it get up ? 
you want a chaser ? 
max , elections happen in november . is this not late december , or have i inhaled too much swamp gas in my time ? 
i think he hired <person> to kill <person> <person> ... it was n't a chinatown gang hit -- <person> <person> and <person> 's wife were lovers ! she just about told me ... ! 
it 's supposed to be <person> <person> . 
i 'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern . active capital , plant and machinery , raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags -- 
those suns got ta come back < u > sometime < /u > . and if these animals really are phobic about light , we just sit tight till then . 
you may discuss my predicament , <person> . you may discuss it with anyone you like , but not with me . i 'm not interested . i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian . 
... we worked together for , what was it , <number> years ... ? now , the work we did here is confidential , not for public scrutiny ... any more than are <number> 's family matters ... 
oh ! you scared me . 
water ... water -- oh , you already said that . 
what do you want from me ? 
<person> , shut up ! 
that game was before you was born .

well , she is cute . 
i ought to get some sleep . 
that 's africa . there 's an african in all of us , is n't there ?

i know what you mean . 
we were friends . i trusted him . i should have known it was weird . but , then again i was weird . 
<person> o-o-o on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink , sir . 
no . i was wondering if you 'd like to take a trip down south with us . maybe see where you grew up -- 
bye . 
okay . <person> . 
this is n't happening . 
that you 're afraid -- 
why ? so you can fuck my wife ? 
that 's right . 
i dunno it 's safe to even get out of the car . 
so you do eat pussy ! 
i dunno what to say to you sweetheart , it is what it is . 
comas are unpredictable . he could wake up today , tomorrow , a month from now ... 
it 's okay . do n't worry about it . 
what did you find ? 
thank you , belle -- 
she was swimming at the ymca pool when it happened . died mid-backstroke . 
cheerful news to greet the morn . 
goddamnit , i 'm talkin ' to the man . you set right there , <person> . 
and you ? 
well , we ca n't just let them fly around the shop , you know . 
no . people never run away from anything . the rain did n't last very long . you know what i think ? i think we 're all in our private traps , clamped in them , and none of us can ever climb out . we scratch and claw ... but only at the air , only at each other , and for all of it , we never budge an inch . 
i 'm not going to let you kill him . 
you 're not ... seeing anybody ? 
man , i do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about . 
right now ! it 's very important , m'sieu laval . 
you ca n't trust you with anything , norm , if you 've lost him , i 'll cripple you . 
oh my ! oh my ... maybe you better come out now , <person> <person> . 
yeah , like ... 
well , of course i like her . she 's a peach . 
i do n't need it that badly . i do n't enjoy crashing other people 's parties . 
let me ask you that again . this time , look around and consider your options . 
when 's the audition ? 
i know where your heart truly lies . 
<person> 's visits to your office . why do you tolerate them ? why him ? 
no , nyet , negatory , not on your tintype , no way . 
i know ! 
is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy <number> ; my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor ? is n't it a comfort to see her ; like a prudent housewife , getting everything ready for her husband 's departure ? 
what happened eighteen months ago ? 
wan na see my driver 's license ? 
about a quarter to <number> . 
and it seems to me , a fella 's trying to come back , he 'd take this settlement , and get a record for himself . i myself would take it and run like a thief . 
her sister 's going to do that . she 's as worried as we are . 
when your son came back from the war , what did he say about all this ? 
why ? 
so , what 's on your mind ? 
no . it most certainly was not . 
i never said i was n't upset . of course i 'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it was n't some `` symptom '' of something ... 
you did n't have to tell me . 
<person> ? 
now ... you go home . 
can you get us a line ? 
sure it is . <person> <person> , if i ever handled a minor felon like that , it 'd be all over the papers . i 'd catch hell . and this is the alleged murderer of the president ? 
what if your chute fails , <person> ? rescind the order . let her off the hook , she 's served her purpose . do it , man , you owe me that much . let me hear it before you check out . 
what 's wrong ? 
saunders . that 's better . good morning , saunders . <person> , saunders . <person> 's the bill coming , saunders -- ? 
she might ! ! ! she might do it , <person> , but you ca n't fuckin ' tell me that she does ! ! ! 
but how would you find him ? 
what the hell would i do with that grease pit ? besides , <person> 's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head . then all this abilene shit happened . you heard about that bank robbery in abilene , did n't ya ? 
i guess you fell in the water . 
do n't ask me . 
because i knew you 'd think exactly what you 're thinking . 
yep . 
no ... could you ? 
see these ? found them in the box with the cards . these are stock certificates . ibm . at & t . polaroid . 
i like it . really ... . 
well , yes , he 'll talk . well , no , no . you 'll have to teach him to talk . 
come over here where i can see you . 
i was getting hot dogs . what do you mean ? 
it never was . 
in that case , here are ten basic plays . i think that 's about all this bunch can handle . 
good morning , <person> . 
what 's the good news ? 
is it really your camper ? 
if i 'm wrong ... 
<number> , <number> car lengths . a hundred and sixty-two feet .

i do n't want to bore you . 
and frog do n't fly and bite like tomcats . it be magic , <person> ... powerful ogre 's magic . 
that is my desire , and my desire is what should concern you , not the sentiments of some commoner ! 
no . what 's this about ? 
you ? 
goodbye , <person> ... 
all right . 
miles . <number> other suits . that 's all i know 'em as -- suits . were you there ? 
twould be to compare <number> star with another in the summer sky . 
nobody can figure it out . and the boss does n't want to pay the electrician to fix it , because the electrician owes money to the video store . 
lois is n't here ? 
maybe . she 's ok . 
about fifty grand . i won it at the tables . 
no , no , what , what is it ? 
how come ? 
i only have something like sixteen weeks .

that 'll make you happy . 
<person> back ! i 'm okay . 
haiti and <person> <person> . <person> through <person> and <person> maybe . 
you hand that over to the police . 
i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point . 
everyone 's grounded . there 's a killer on the loose . 
of course i am . i feel the testosterone coursing through my veins . now that i 've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back . 
you know the suspect ? 
come on , <person> . gim me a break -- 
if you guys want in , fine . just remember this is our jurisdiction . 
why do i tell you this ? i never told <person> . i never even remembered it until you got me going . 
for more than <number> years . so <person> told me . 
okay , if that 's what it takes , you 'll never have to see me again . here ... here ... 
what 's that supposed to mean ? he was right here . he was ! 
well , whatta we got here ? 
<person> <person> at the morgue and now veronica lake with white . what the hell 's going on ? 
i thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother . 
i do n't believe that . i think you are insulted by me , somehow . you 're a foreigner too , are n't you , here , in this market ? 
i know that . 
why do n't we try to keep politics out of the conversation . 
where do you get your ideas ? only joking -- i 'm just joking . let 's go to a brothel then , <person> , come on . 
but if we have not caught <person> -- 
you mean you 'll tell us his name ? ? ? 
i 've been on another case . all day . i suppose i can move it over . <person> fifty a week , plus travel expenses . 
no , i just promised myself i 'd give it a try . i got ta get out there sooner or later . 
what some brandy ? 
well , you got the big gauge . 
i 'm sure i do n't know . 
actually , never . they 'll always hate you . there 's a gene for it . 
no , keeper . 
that 's <number> things . 
oh , he went home to india , but as far as i know he 'll be back . 
i though <person> was just an old town story . 
why would the kid shoot at us ? 
i always have a couple on the hook . you know . there 's <number> right now , i 've got her panting like a dog . it 's great . 
but we might just give it the 'ole college try . what with the court back ups , it could be days before you got an arraignment . but then , i 'm sure the flunk-out neice of the d.a . knows all about that . 
well , good . good for you . 
we 're liable to win if we keep this up . for somebody like you , you sure run fast . 
... do n't think so . when they start to drool , they get rid of 'em . these guys are proud of what they did . they did <person> <person> ! they took out the president of the united states ! that 's entertainment ! and they served their country doing it . 
so did i . he was friendly to me as no man ever was . 
in your opinion . 
that 's fab , because i love you , too , vanessa . 
do n't talk to me , <person> <person> . do n't say nothing to me this morning . 
i thought you did n't know how to drive . 
i ai n't askin ' what you 'll do after you get out , because i 'm gon na be dead and it do n't matter . 
we keep it quiet . it 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to talk about upstairs . not with the press around . 
i should do this myself . 
yes , i 'm sure it is . that 's what they say , anyway . 
that bitch called me a bitch . 
i do not see how . the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device . 
<person> bam . 
i want to be alone . 
oh , it just ended , then . 
somebody 's got to .

this -- this is a luau that sells packing material ! 
hey , do n't worry . <person> and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this . 
we 're all ears . 
if i see him . 
oh , i do n't blame them , really . i guess i have sort of made a mess of things . these folks have to protect their investment . most of them are very nice people -- 
you know , he 's got a point . we 're fucking americans . we stick out like sore thumbs . 
he tried to burn the house down , said it was possessed by the spirits . <person> was sleeping in the basement where the fire started . i do n't think <person> ever meant to harm us ... but <person> was badly burnt , his ears were destroyed and most of his skin . 
what 's the matter ? 
no ! 
why not ? i must have subjects . it 's the only way i can teach . it 's the only way you can learn . the stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as <person> . we can do our own dirty work -- and we must . 
but where do you come from ? 
do you remember the detonation time ? 
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine ? 
his -- real -- ? 
commandeer . we 're going to commandeer a ship . nautical term . 
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them ? ! 
all right , all right . its true , what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened <number> years ago ? 
does it matter ? 
he did n't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly . 
the oriental . 
then we 'll keep driving ... you 'll decide . 
you better get in there with her until this thing is over . 
what exactly are we going to do ? 
no questions .

why did you come here , <person> ? 
<person> zimm . the man happens to be a major hollywood player . 
i 'll buy a plant .

sure . 
which number do you want , <person> ? 
so you believe me ? 
is that what her daddy tells her ? 
how long , then ? 
<person> up that tree and get a better view ! 
she 's good . 
all right , you remember the *man* then . 
where it began -- mccluskey auditorium . 
that 's not a bad idea . how many episodes before he comes back ? 
queen <person> is a man ! prince <person> is a faggot ! <person> <person> was full of shit ! 
yes , i do , <person> .

looking back ... i suppose it was . i did n't quite realize it at the time but ... 
<number> more night -- 
right . 
what 's your fuckin ' problem , anyway ? 
good . good . 
you ought to put up a banner -- `` frontera , texas : gateway to cut- rate pussy '' -- 
yes .

it 's fun . 
no , in person . now . 
ok. mister stansfield , <person> <person> .

zaltar ! 
i mean , it 's not true , is it ? 
that 's marvelous ... . you must have worked day and night ... . do n't you ever sleep ?

still clear . 
got it , teach . 
alright , <person> . we 'll do it your way . 
<person> ? 
yeah .

[ that 's what everybody keeps saying . ] 
listen to me very carefully , <person> . you are not to see <person> again . ever . those are my orders . is that clear ? 
you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier . 
how ? 
jean and <person> never have to worry . 
a little drastic maybe ? 
i 've studied the case file , have you ... ? everything you need to find him is right in these pages . whatever his name is . 
you sold it ? i thought they stole it . 
cool . 
yeah , it does . 
i 'm sure . 
well , that 's what we 're here for . 
i could determine if he were dead < u > before < /u > he went into the hudson . 
which boarder ? saudi ? kuwait ? syria ? 
he 's not married . besides , i 've got a right to do what 's best for me . 
kinda like men . 
all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible . 
no , no . 
i 'm your man ... you win again . <person> played , sir . you are on fire . 
you work around town ? 
knox , you 're crazy . 
and then what ? i 'll never be safe . i 'll have to leave the country ! you ca n't protect me , and you ca n't keep him in jail ! and you knew that all the goddamn time ! 
busy ? 
i can try . is it comedy , or tragedy ?

as appealing as that sounds ... 
why are they after < u > me < /u > ? 
... so that 's why you hate him ...

are you sure ? 
yes , <person> . i will . 
<number> . 
<person> got left ... ? 
i 'll try ... it 's what the don would want us to do . 
as they used to say ... all systems are go . 
whatever . 
if this is a joke , it 's not funny . 
do you love your parents ? 
<person> ? 
she says , throw it overboard . she does n't want it . she says it 's spoiled 
yeah . 
that they 'll start touching us inside our heads . 
we 've got ta burn the rain forest , <person> . <person> toxic waste , pollute the air , rip up the ozone . maybe if we screw this planet up enough they wo n't want it anymore . 
i do n't know . i do n't want to find out . 
just meet with the boy once a week . 
yes . this <number> though is ... very good . 
yeah . 
curtis is afraid you 'll marginalize us . 
keep trying . 
i been thinking about how much i hate you . 
whoever . they 're the ones . they 'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me . 
twombley 's shot . i heard that . not <person> . he 's okay , i assume . 
okay . 
that 's brilliant . 
you say you have n't seen your son since the day before yesterday ? 
soon . <number> week . 
every day of your life you 'll want me . you 'll never get over it . every time you see your face in the mirror -- 
i ... i do n't know why i just said that . i meant to say that ...

as i recall , the town of resurrection is about <number> kilometers east of here . they might have a hospital ... 
shelly ? 
well , sir , you said you might . 
but she is n't due for an hour , sir . 
that 's right . 
yeah , and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle . 
almost that fast . i got a few loose ends to tie up first . <person> into a shitload of money recently . i 've always wanted to go to take a trip . we 're just gon na walk into the airport and decide right then and there . 
lost my eyes on okinawa . lost them fighting the war . fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me . 
you can trust me . 
what were the others ? 
oh fucking relax . let your hair down for once . it 's your fucking birthday , for chrissakes . you 're such a fucking pussy . i swear to g-d , i married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid . 
any time , <person> . 
close only by virtue of antithesis . 
wade -- i 've been working toward this audition for years . 
you really think so ... us ? 
will you stop being silly , <person> ? 
... deer . 
it do n't matter . i 'm gon na get you outta here . 
no ... in the brains ... what little i 'm sure he has . 
pasture ? oh , that stretch of field near the hill ? yeah . 
i just want to be alone . 
let 's talk about us , not her . 
it 's okay , <person> <person> . <person> , <person> , the others -- they 're right . my stories are annoying . they go on and on and on , and the longer they go on the more annoying they become , until finally you just want to grab something heavy and -- 
couple more miles up this road . 
oh . you 're going away . 
holding you ... again . 
splendid . 
perfect . 
that 's close enough , major . 
yeah , she is . good luck . 
i paid you back . 
i 'm not leaving without that tape . 
not even her ? 
excuse me ? 
yeah , <number> minutes . trust me . i 've been pepper sprayed <number> times . <number> minutes . 
craig is <number> syllable 
it was just a trim . 
i do n't know exactly . i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization ... i thought you know ... maybe seeing you , some friends , my house ... of course now a <number> -- 
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that jenzen girl . the little bitch has the right stuff . she nearly put a bullet in price right after your `` demise . '' 
yes , sir . i need a room 
it simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems . it 's only principle is the butterfly effect . a butterfly can flap its wings in peking and in central park you get rain instead of sunshine . 
poorly . 
she 's going to leave you - 
maybe you 're right . but it 's still my command , and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew . and i think there is . <person> , download all the files from the event <person> 's computers . <person> , <person> , finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark . 
i know it is n't . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
i 'm with someone . 
i just saw <person> . he 's here . 
yes , you doofus . 
you mean to someone like <person> <person> . 
what 's dr. gillman say ? 
i been talking to swanbeck in new york and ... <person> , i think they 're gon na take it a long pause as <person> looks at schaefer 
my old man split along time ago . it does n't mean anything . you just take care of number <number> that 's all that matters . 
you wo n't find them . wo n't find west , either . he 's too good . 
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ... 
i do n't know why we could n't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being . we could have hid it in the fridge . 
i did go . just back . <person> , these are a couple of our passengers - <person> <person> <person> , and dr. <person> <person> . my exec , commander <person> <person> . 
well somone 's got to suffer for this doctor . you 've got to be merciful and quick . excuse me . 
i mean it -- you got enough money now . head out for california . <person> 's up , <person> , and you 're digging wells in the snow . 
he 's going to be a fireman . 
he seems lonely . 
but what about you and the baby ? you need me . 
your first question should be who is n't . it is n't a spark , brian . not enough damage . and an insurance pro ? where 's the profit margin ? 
no . 
let 's get outta this stink . 
and i do n't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards ! ! 
it reminds me of this <number> time -- hey , can i ask you a question ? how come you do n't have any stories ? i 've got lots of stories , and you do n't have any . 
i 'm all right . 
<person> used his influence . now , <person> , watch what you say . everybody hears everything . a lot of things get said and done that , well , let 's just say this is n't america . <person> is cheap here , you know ? no offense , but you know what i 'm saying ? 
`` an internship and <number> years of training at the boston lying-in , south end branch . for his age , he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon ; he is also experienced in pediatric care ... '' 
what ? a genius ? . . . an inspiration ? 
who knows ? it 's not hard to figure out what she 'll wind up like . when the respect for parents breaks down , that 's bad ... you know i 'm `` cumpari '' with them ... so i take an interest . you live next door , keep an eye open ... but do n't get involved . 
you want to get into this now ? 
big deal . 
i wo n't calm down . i ca n't do this . we ca n't do this . it wo n't work . it will not work . 
hold your arm out . you ca n't hope to be cured quickly . you heard what the doctor said . if it had been seen to in time ... this 'll take time . but with the help of god , we 'll pull through . 
let me see it ... 
... fuck you mean , it 's raining frogs ? 
i feel so embarrassed . 
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of . 
do n't you even want to ask ? 
what is it ? 
nicholas ... 
yourself . <person> , bad , everything . just show me who you are for once . 
yes . 
i 'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg , <person> <person> . 
i ca n't find him . i 've tried everything . i thought you might know . 
you 're under arrest . 
just a crank making phone calls . happens a dozen times a day at the office . 
what what ? what advantages ? 
... i do n't know . 
no . she 's probably scared to death . 
a flare ? a flare wo n't do it . 
yeah ... you just want me to wave , right ? 
i mean , do you have something i could show my manager ? i mean , do you have a reel ? 
amy , listen to me . <person> is n't such a terrible thing . 
<person> about interrupting ... 
no , it 's what body builders drink to beef up . 
yes or no . they 're both easier at home . <person> ? 
he 's just full of plans that are n't gon na work out . 
now tell me ... what do you see ? 
you know i ca n't . 
sure . <number> of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago . 
life support check . <person> , it 's obvious you 've been ignoring me . you 're a woman . i can relate to that . 
how you feelin ' ? ok ? you feelin ' good ? 
the ear is from a missing person maybe ? 
you got worms . 
do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first ? this is tiring me . 
you know , it 's a california thing . that scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to <number> when they were out in l.a. you know , the men put their car keys in a bowl , and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever 's keys they 've got . anyhow that 's how she met this rod person or whatever his name is and he 's left his wife and she 's packing for california . <person> is devastated . it 's so ironic . 
it was romantic . he 's very romantic . 
goodbye , darling . do n't you dare forget ... december <number> . 
so there you are . so i guess i 'm not such a dog as i think i am . 
thank you . 
the palace in new york . but <person> there 's something else . 
waiting for <person> to call me . he said he 'd call tonight . oh do n't be difficult , <person> . 
then we both know . i 'll point . you drive . <person> . 
i hope i did n't keep you from something . 
that is how v'ger will survive . 
i do n't know . 'cause you 're cute . 
did the wife confess ? 
my stuff 's in the trunk ! god ! you care more about that car than you do about most people . 
actually this has n't happened to me in some time . 
he says if i want to get back to work , no problem . he wants me to come in and talk and ... and ... < u > that 's < /u > < u > it < /u > ! 
so ? 
yeh . 
you got a punk-ass mouth on you , kid . 
come on , i got over <number> bucks on the line . 
shit ... 
lieutenant , self-expression does not seem to be <number> of your problems . 
if you get me pregnant with a boy he 'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne . 
'he ' ... ? 
you gave me the bad dreams . you left me behind ... 
did they argue the day before he died ? 
just between you and me , i never intended taking it off . 
quit bitching , you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit ... ah to be in pari-is and in love . 
ha ha . 
-- so if you think it 's appropriate , i 'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch -- 
you mean , do i like to take the offensive ? or hang back and wait . 
oh , are you on the team ? 
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior , but there 's no evidence of murder - there 's not even a body . 
really ? 
hey . 
do you believe in it ? 
i do n't want to hurt you , <person> . yet . after tomorrow , you can do anything you want , but please , just stay out of sight for the next <number> hours . i wo n't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you . i warn you , do n't tempt <person> <person> when he is angry . let is complete our mission in peace . 
yeah . what would you think if we went there to live for a while ? 
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate ! 
he 's killed closer . 
is that bee-bee ? 
do n't know if i 'll still want it . 
she is alive , <person> <person> -- that 's all . 
oh lean over here , lady . lean this way . 
do n't bother to thank me , it 's the easiest thing in the world . matter of fact , i know where a vacancy just came up . 
god gets lonesome for us , <person> . he wants us back . 
and do n't be so goddamn sensitive . who cares what anybody thinks anyway ? you want to be a good writer ? you want to be a great writer ? then stop giving a damn what other people think . most of them have n't thought in years . 
i 'm at <number> wonderland avenue . it 's right off <person> . 
what is your name ? 
they look nice . 
great , you can start right away . call me <person> . now , umm , is this what you 'd normally wear for work ? do n't get me wrong , i like it , very much , but the ... . 
and you just figured that out ? the swede is n't a hitman , is he ? he 's a surgeon . <person> did n't want israel 's heart for a trophy , he wanted it for a transplant ... why ? 
hell , he looks dead . 
i 'm taking a shower . 
i want it to be over for you . 
what do you want ? 
so hello . 
i do n't make policy . 
i 'll talk to the mayor . 
me ? no . only things that need calming in my dreams are the rockettes . 
what 's your offer , <person> ? 
why not -- ? 
well , i 'm <number> of your biggest supporters . i tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you . 
do n't listen . 
what about the heart that you promised <person> <person> -- ? 
italians , <person> , irish . <number> big party . <person> , some guys do n't get along . 
nothing . 'cause how you do delivery on the beach , i do n't like . maybe this does not work . 
<person> ! have they roughed you up yet ? 
stop what ? 
i bet . 
i need someone with your kind of background . 
instead of a girdle . and light as a feather . 
maybe i do n't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here , but i do n't work the same way . 
no , he ai n't ! and the car 's gone , too . 
cut the mush , <person> . he 's after our skin ! 
not at all . have a seat . 
never mind that . i 'm concerned about you . your attitude . 
huh . 
what do you think ? 
yes i do . my family owns it . it 's ours . you do n't belong here . 
so tell me how it is . 
that money would n't last forever . and then what ? you 'd be back in some other part of the rackets . another <person> <person> to slap you around and burn holes in your hands . this way , you 've got to go the square route . you could send me a card when you 're settled , i could maybe help out sometimes ... 
how are you ? 
it 's not that easy..we 've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have <number> dna memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..this <number> has <number> . 
sir , you 're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior . 
usually at the point when she 's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater ! 
excellent ! 
thank you , sir . you 're a good man , sir . 
the chill is worse this night . 
bollocks . 
i filmed this the morning they left . 
can you live with it ? 
the fbi found something that belonged to my son . a sandal ... anyway , <person> was upset . he ... he ... 
you ca n't go because of <person> ? 
your pardon , m'lord , he asked me to come in his stead . 
be better if i could talk to him in person . but he 's not an easy man to get to . 
last month , before thanksgiving . 
a very small service . it does n't even ask for thanks . how long for ? 
you have <number> heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wan na run up and down the stairs . <person> - i forgot to pick up the cigarettes . 
is that right ? 
well , it ai n't no pup tent in the garage , you know what i mean ? fuck . so they 'll talk and talk . they 'll probably talk all night . and , oh , they 'll decide that they 're gon na spend the night together , right ? but , you know , they 're gon na keep their underwear on and they 're not gon na do anything . by <number> a.m. he 's parking the pink cadillac . <person> . there 's really only <number> answer . 
no ... i move faster alone . 
i remember you now . <person> . 
nudie booth . you 've never been in a nudie booth ? 
hi , <person> .

an artistry and sensitivity you 've never shown before . 
i already apologized .

yeah i did . treasurer . should n't you be studying or something . 
it was you who did the asking . 
did anyone stand out ? 
would they do that ? 
what are they like ? what are they about ? 
you 'd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen . 
what ? ! 
i 'll pick you up , <person> <person> . where are you staying ? 
ready for what ? sight-seeing ? 
what are you talking about , <person> ? you were n't mentioned in the story . do n't jump to conclusions . 
you are . 
what ? 
i 'm <person> <person> . <person> . 
you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that . 
my insurance wo n't cover it . 
we thought a doctor might help .

what 'd you do to your hair ? 
not me . 
jane , i have to talk to you . 
darwinism at its best . 
you do n't have any baggy shorts ? pajama bottoms ? 
why are you protecting him ? you knew he was doping , yet you did nothing about it . 
i think it 's called `` a shower '' . you might try it sometime . 
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions . 
she left me . 
... about what ? 
i never go upstairs . you 're a nice old lady . 
let me know what you want -- i 'll pick a suit that matches . 
do n't kill me . oh shit , please no . i 'm <person> . i 'm the funny man ! ... the funny man ... the funny . 
i come from time to time . when i 'm needed . 
oh my god , a mistake ! 
that 's correct -- but <person> never told me he had a heart condition . he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious . 
then why the hell are you sitting around here ? 
oooh , i see . did n't go so good last night , huh ? that 's a shocker . you mean getting drunk and calling <person> did n't put you in the mood ? you dumb fuck . your divorce pain 's getting real old real fast , dude . 
what 's your miami pd badge number ? 
just a minute ... 
and a lot of time .

your excellency , you requested some specimens of my work . here they are . i do n't have to tell you how much i need your help . i truly appreciate your looking at these . i have pressures on me - financial pressures . as you know , i 'm a married man now . 
part of me wanted to go off with him , the rest of me could n't ... i do n't know why he wants me ... . 
this is a major screw up on your part , goddamn it !

what are you talking about ? 
only sailors use condoms , man . 
yes , you did . you said as long as i do n't act like a fuckin ' nut , implying that i 've been acting like a fuckin ' nut .

<person> ?

i agree . 
are you kidding ? 
never , but i 've been practicing . 
yes ? 
i said i 'll take care of it . now , a man of your position should n't be a part of what 's about to go down . so go home and i 'll call you tomorrow . 
we could n't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox , but ... 
there 's no call for that , <person> . <person> made himself a pile of enemies over the years . 
there will never be a need . 
well , it 's your business to get news ! and here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the tribune scoop us on it . making a first class <person> a monkey out of me . if it ever happens again - just do n't bother about coming back . that 's all . 
where do you come from ? 
what ? 
but she must want to stand . she must want to walk . 
you do n't have to burst in here every time , <person> . just call and make an appointment . 
no . not that either . 
foxy . . . <person> . . . you know you 're a cute little heartbreaker ... <person> ... you know you 're a sweet little love maker ...

i go places , i interact . 
he brought you to me , did n't he ? if you want julia to live , trust me . trust him . 
adam , this is n't like you . please come to the office . there must be something we can do .

uh-huh . you recall , did it say dead or alive ? 
you 're a wonderful writer , <person> . do n't be discouraged . 
no ... 
are you threatening me , because i 'm sure that 's a violation of the terms of your bail .

i do n't know . 
you are a fine figure of a man .

oh sure and you will want sex , always sex . 
oh , no , no , no . 
i got what i paid for . 
anything ! just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something . 
okay . then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list . 
yeah , well , he 's ... 
leave then , some friend you are . 
no . that 's okay . 
heavens ! the man 's insane ! 
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap .

how 'd you get up here ? 
the winning side would have paid you much better . 
it 's not me , moron . 
sure , <person> , what 's up ? 
right . 
maybe next summer he 's going to take me hunting with him -- and fishing . i want him to teach me how and i bet he wo n't get mad if i goof . his name 's <person> . it 's really <person> but he likes <person> more . people he really likes -- he lets call him `` <person> . ''

you switched the charts ; you tell me . 
no . you listen . i had my doubts about you from the beginning 
i 'm not very bright , i guess . 
<person> ?

you 're willing to die for this . 
i do n't know , <person> . you 're the fucking expert . now get out of the way ! 
otho , could you actually ... do something with them ? 
where are all your queer party friends ? 
oh , yeah .

on the radio they say it 's good .

this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented ! 
yeah , really . 
well -- where ya goin ' ? 
so they took care of leo . 
i do n't think there 's been any debate . there 's no debate ... my mistakes ... .

well , i 'll tell you . i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money . 
somehow i imagined books . i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time . 
i dabble in pharmaceuticals , medical research . we 've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate , a few others things . 
what 'd i tell you ? 
why would i do that ? 
that 's the way i like 'em - big and sassy . and get rid of your roommate . 
did n't know i needed a reason to come home . 
beverly <person> hairdresser ... what kind of a thing is that to do ... you might as well be a faggot ... think that 's funny too ? 
yeah . oh , <person> bless ! 
we 've gone insane . 
hello . 
it 's a hoax . i knew it ! 
is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who is n't connected in some war to <number> of the cartels ? 
it was just that , maybe the way the sun struck the ocean , the sound of the waves . it was simple , whatever it was . then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good . it 's been a long time . 
nothing special , just a spoke in the wheel . 
here , here . 
then say you 'll spend <person> <person> at the track with me . 
need to get in that building ? 
... i believe in live and ... 
<person> loomis , you 're so busy being defensive that you have n't even reacted to the most serious fact of all . <person> is missing .

eight times . they 've burned him , dipped him in nuclear waste -- 
i know exactly what the hell you 're talking about and you 're right , you do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . let 's just grow up , be adults , and die . 
you got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them . 
you ca n't talk that way about my movie . 
and now you must let me be the judge of that !

... you 're money ...

wow . i thought i was the only one . 
hello .

i was an attorney ! 
okay . 
why do i think there 's never been a ripley rainy day ? 
you do n't think i 'm smart enough to be serious about . 
it 's not my back that 's killing me . 
oh , that makes it okay , then . 
you 've got <number> hell of a great body . 
excuse me if i 'm impertinent , but -- how did you becomeâ€¦ whatever it is you are ? 
no . 
i was , you bastard . 
oh ! 
thank you . 
i did n't wait on him . <person> or so , white , regular build , needed a shave -- that 's all i remember . 
i know . we 're checking every cellular account in the county . any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross-referenced . it 's gon na take time but we 'll find him . 
why do you get to choose ? why do n't i get to choose ? 
moonby , <number> battalion , <person> <person> <person> , <person> <person> . ex-corporal <person> , deserted . 
straylight . <person> dock . 
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you . 
when all this is over , we simply must get you out of that suit . 
oh , burgel ! <person> was having an affair with <person> . they were both members of < u > this group < /u > . if any crime 's been discovered and people are paying for it , i 'd look to < u > yourselves < /u > ! 
we all stick to this , it 's smooth sailing . 
i know , ignoring me . what 're you up to ? 
where did you learn to do this ? 
he 's busy right now . 
there 's no such thing as tough , creasy . <person> trained and untrained . 
good idea . <person> . we 're hungry . 
you know what you look like ? 
no ... this is the first time for me , too . 
but , why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing ? it must have been intentional . 
what the hell did you go doing that for <person> ? we have n't even gotten naked yet ! 
of course it was <person> . if it was <person> <person> , you 'd be out to here ! 
everything will be seen to . 
carlos , i never raped a woman . 
<person> to tell . looks like he 's been cleaned up and he 's decomposing as we speak . this case gets weirder by the minute . 
because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' . 
well , my idea of stupid is very different from yours . so here 's how this is gon na work . would you take your socks off , please ? 
good . 
dr. <person> <person> .

they 're touching . 
i am prepared to accept the terms , <person> <person> . 
in return ... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game . do we have a deal ? 
no . 
nothing . 
-- <person> , what are you doing here ? 
<person> <person> <person> is a man who is dying , and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom . he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived . he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases , and no veil keeps his senses , his eyes , his soul from enjoying your beauty . 
i feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision . not that i blame them . how could they know ? today 's world is so complicated . no . i have to go away now . i 'm sorry , <person> . i 'm so sorry . 
what was her name ? 
the people in the town ? 
what do you take me for ? 
< u > that < /u > might be a < u > little < /u > < u > rough < /u > ! 
so why the crazy talk ? it 's a miracle it is . <person> <person> has smiled on me . on us . 
it 's the model you 've been saving up for . i wanted you to have it for your trip . 
you must listen . everybody 's pretending , <person> . 
<number> . <number> years --

the ship will sink . 
yeah , well ... i forgot my morphine back in the room . 
you 'll be hist ... 
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview ... where you 're saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics ... ? 
so it would seem . 
no â€”- really , i can see them -- they 're coming now -â€” turn off the lights â€”â€” 
well , i held it like an egg . 
you do n't mean that doctor ? 
she 's not been here for a long time . 
because i need money ! 
no . she happens to think the last one was murdered . 
what ? 
oh , i do n't know ... depends on who you are spending it with . 
certainly , if you insist . you must have quite a find there . 
so they said more than the address . 
no , no . i 'm on my way to my audition . before i go i wanted to ask you if you could remember the man 's name ... <person> <person> 's friend who helped put this together . it completely went out of my mind . 
do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked ' it up . 
agnes , how are babies born ? 
pink panther , black panther . who gives a shit ? and i do n't remember asking you a god damn thing , you little turd . 
as far as <person> <person> knows , i 'm just a joy ridin ' georgia redneck . we keep 'em outta your backyard , we 're cool . now just give me <number> to ditch this idiot and i 'll meet you in ole miss . 
you should go on a trip . 
she would if she heard my voice on the phone . 
no ! ... although that 's a good guess . no , what i 've been working on , what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- -- a virtually life-like , humanoid , gender-specific , anatomically functional ... sexual surrogate slash companion . 
baby , do n't lie . i know you went out . 
only got <number> kind . 
it 's a character thing , <person> . i mean , you would n't do it . no offense . me neither . i mean , a guy like bubber , he 's a certain kinda guy . <person> . you and me , we 're not ... heroic . it 's not our nature . it do n't mean we 're bad or nothing . we 're just not so inclined . what about it ? 
who would 've thought he was capable of such atrocities ? ! 
like hell it does . 
you 're a big girl , huh ? 
of course . 
you got no idee . people there lookee diffelent ; speakee diffelent . nothing the same . in my countlee i bling good luck . <person> lain and thunder . 
wait a minute . . . 
that 's not what you were about to say . 
<number> o'clock then ... you know treves ... it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance . 
i hope they 're doing better than we are . we do n't even have helmets . 
o.k. , kid -- i 'm only sorry for <number> thing . 
a little respect would be nice , that 's all . 
oh , umm , yes , this is <person> <person> . 
where 's the collar , in the cells ?

that 's ... that 's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts ! 
they have done ... nothing ... they are my people ... 
only there 's no business like it , no business i know . 
winning is easy . losing is complicated . it 's a lifetime 's work . 
mom , black folks been praying to god for <number> <number> years . maybe it 's time we tried something else ... 
thank you . 
it was an accident . 
hey , you , get off my cloud . i 'm talking to my friend . <number> <person> <person> with original humbucking pick-ups , maple neck , strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius ... <person> <person> .

we disagree on how god-awful it was . why do n't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time ?

that must be it . 
i think so . 
do n't go soft on me , baby . i 've got your note in my pocket . you wrote it , all by your own self . and i have to use it . it has to be found in exactly the right place . 
not anymore , not after this . 
maybe she has n't read the paper ... 
of a fight he ca n't win out here . 
i do n't know . 
i warned you -- i get on a roll ... 
yeah , but <person> was n't just any gangster . he was the gangster who set up track <number> in cuba . 
okay ! 
yes , he is . he 's very excited and confused , but he 's not crazy , if that 's what you mean . 
you been in and out goin ' on <number> ... maybe <number> days . 
then <person> will have to kill all of you . 
remember how they used to stick out ? 
yah . 
gentlemen , i have a plan . it 's called blackmail . the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world . either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money , or we make it look like prince charles , the heir to the throne , has had an affair outside of marriage and , therefore , they would have to divorce . 
please wait till my husband gets home . 
like what ? 
newer , more powerful design . 
you following me ? 
of course . as soon as possible . 
rex . go away . i do n't want to have to sic the dogs on you . 
okay . <person> ? do you think i 'm too fat ? 
do n't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were- 
ro - you ca n't really believe that . nobody can murder someone with their feelings . i mean -- - that 's crazy . 
amazing . i hate to say it , but it is . 
just ... try and go back to sleep . 
put you in touch with <person> . 
ah ha . you finally want to know about women . 
it 's not that nice . 
right ! 
anywhere but here . 
oh . well , what 's this ? 
hey take it easy man . they 're scared . 
i moved payroll onto the computer . it only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night . 
you 're amazing . you figured this all out already ? 
is n't that interesting ? 
not without defeats -- and great pain . but are there no defeats in this war -- no pain ? what you can not do is accept injustice . from <person> -- or anyone . you must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so . 
jenkins ! 
you there ? 
he kicked major ass and you know it . 
yes . tell me about the day you got off the train . 
you met him . <person> <person> , the dental officer . 
i do n't believe you . 
power yoga ? 
no , you do n't want to hear that . 
i may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread . <number> years is a long time for your comrades to wait . 
what ? 
no . 
if i call the police , your price will go down to a minus sign . 
just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity , i 've been around that long , but it 's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest . call it boredom , the natural curiosity of me , the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you . 
you know i 'm whacko , <person> , what 'd you find ? 
-- anything you want -- 
how are you doing ? 
information was arriving all day yesterday . when we finally figured out who <person> actually was , we -- 
all right you â€™ re the super sleuth , what do you want , a medal ? 
you believe me , do n't you ? 
how long has he been here ... ? 
you do n't . 
i 'll hurry back . 
you saw a lot in <number> night . 
you mean i can have the room ? 
thank you , <person> <person> . but i 'm sick -- i have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and i got to go to bed right after work . 
i know . 
that 's the way i want it . just turn the radio on and go . 
i forgot my vacuum cleaner . 
i just wanted to see her , that 's all . 
i 'm calling on people who knew <person> <person> . i 'm calling on you . 
use your influence with <person> . ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table . 
you 're lucky . they kill as well . 
no good options left ? 
yeah , well , i lost my pen . by the time i got a new <number> , i was clean out of paper . 
the important thing is not to panic . 
you 're out of money ? 
connections ? i have no connections , only favors . if i call to help <person> , a general will think `` <person> <person> is a fool . he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody . '' then my hard work is doubly squandered . i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all . please leave these things to my good judgment . 
look , pal . i make an honest living . people do n't come to me unless they 're miserable and i help 'em out of a bad situation . i do n't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank . 
-- red nose and ears . i know , i know . 
good excuse . how many others you got ? 
you were good . 
lumber , ma'am -- spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance -- -- and now gosh darn it -- '' <person> <person> '' -- that 's what they call me -- is goin ' to see the world . 
kubelik . 
and she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him , did n't she ? 
am i keeping you ? i 'm sorry . 
easy ... easy ... i 'm going to throw in my trap now .

whatever it takes . 
you got a better idea ... ? 
it 's something i do ... 
okay . be a good girl and go inside . 
nothing . it got messed up . 
you saying the democrats bugged themselves ? 
saved a lot of folk from the railroad . 
we know . 
and what does <person> think 's real ? 
in addition to `` psychic dolt '' this test also proves i 'm unlucky ? <number> of hearts . 
when are you gon na get off my case ? have you got a search warrant ? what do you want -- cheap thrills ? 
you saw that ? 
you do ? is he a funny uncle ? 'cause if he is , then he and i got somethin ' in common . 
well , thank you . anyway -- time for bed . or ... sofa-bed . 
many times , in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak , but i have to tell you that , being a police officer , i 've seen it happen : young woman afraid to speak , next thing you know , i 'm gettin ' a call on the radio , i got a <number> -- 
look , general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the <number> bomb wing to attack with h-bombs . 
maude ? ? ? ! 
killed ? why do you use that word ? 
i need help . 
nothing 's wrong . it 's great , okay ? having the time of my life . <person> 's a fantastic director . and what can anyone say about <person> that has n't been said . and it 's great working with friends , blah blah blah .

well , <person> -- i do n't think -- that would be possible . 
well sir , my name is jordan rivers and these here are the soggy bottom boys outta cottonelia mississippi- songs of salvation to salve the soul . we hear you pay good money to sing into a can . 
no , i 'm fine ... i got it together ... . 
yeah , i 'll do that . 
the whale ! how could i forget ? <person> was something fishy about that woman ! 
i have no idea . her maid said she left <number> days ago , to meet me -- i can imagine where she is . but when she finally does come home , she will find her things in the street and my door locked . 
not funny . 
yes . that 's my case . now it 's yours . all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way . decapitated . <person> extracted . <person> torn to shreds . it looked like the work of a large animal , but there was no sign of an animal on board . 
that 's an evasion and you know it . 
.jeffrey ! . <person> wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store . maybe going back to school will be an option <number> day . i hope so . 
are n't you supposed to keep them ? 
stop kidding me ! <number> years in a town like los ang-gleez , and a peanut selling job is the best you can do ? you expect me to believe that ? 
yeah , probably a good idea . 
tell rebecca i said 'hi ' , now ... 
yes . it 's a bad place . weird people . strange things go on . 
no . but a small <number> . 
are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in abilene , <person> <person> ?

there is only <number> solution to your problem , mrs. tasker . you must work for us . 
yeah . 
in my day , it was simply called the double cross . i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck . in our context , it simply means infiltration of the democrats . 
i ca n't do it even if he 's gone . 
yes . i will . 
i 'm not hiding up no tree . i 'm with her . let 's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho 's butt . 
could n't you have moved in with your mom ? 
for <person> 's sake , just get on the plane , okay ! 
maybe you can help me . actually , who i 'm looking for is a friend of ours from detroit . <person> <person> ? i heard he was in town . <person> be travelling with a pretty girl named <person> . have you seen him ? are they stayin ' here ? 
what are you saying ? i 'm standing here as real as you . 
that 's my decision , <person> and that 's final . 
< u > what < /u > did he do to the uniform ? ! 
i thought you might be able to make a connection . 
but <person> , it 's a starring part ! you 're second billed . 
and . i always said , he was a < u > p'lice < /u > officer . 
the old man saw it in a dream . 
you said <person> was arranging laboratory work . police laboratory . anything from that ? 
close . <person> , you are the wolf , cunning and swift . 
i thought i might stop by . 
that 's the rock star thing .

oh , no , no , no . it , uh , it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that <person> and i part , anyway . 
i mean was there another- i thought i heard a voice . 
'any sufficiently advanced technology ... ' 
i guess so . 
they want you to stand for sheriff next election . 
am i going mad or did the word `` think '' escape your lips ? you were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass . 
you play an instrument ? 
the powwow safe . the secret safe . you said the manager 's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money . 
i was just going to sell it to friends . i 'm not a pusher , honest . 
not really . i 've just always been fascinated by <person> . 
i 'm not like you . 
yeah ? 
gotcha . 
you do n't understand . i recognized his face now come on . 
<person> <person> <person> . as in froot loops ? but he does know things . 
why ?

they never used to send a navy car . 
yes . 
no . i was n't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night . 
i 'm looking for somebody . 
no . this has been going on for some time . several months . about <number> months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river . they were from people who were reported missing . they never found <number> complete body . only parts . 
i 'm going to the store . 
close the fucking door ! 
does he have the spot ? 
oh -- i was thinking -- <person> <person> -- lying there , his eyes so open . 
what exactly does that mean ? 
no , <person> . yes , <person> . no , <person> . 
she told me not to talk to you . 
well , it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street . 
what i just said , no assassin would say . what i 've said , only a mark would say . 
i 've got to think of emily - 
if you 're gon na do this again <person> , it 's not gon na be on my watch . 
what do you mean , <person> ? 
what 's your point ? 
then you can not ignore that according to their calculations , the circumference of the earth is approximately ... <number> leagues or more . which makes the ocean ... uncrossable . 
no one goes anywhere alone . least of all , unarmed . 
you go to lady now ? 
in the city , it happened all the time -- some kid o.d . 's on a rooftop , top , a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local , old people die alone in shitty apartments and <number> weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies . call the cops . what are we , immune ? 
by making me ill , he is punishing me ! i just do n't know what for .

yeah , yeah -- we 're all fuckin ' amazed . anyone not ready for this ? 
eighty bucks ? ! ? 
we 've got about <number> or <number> prospects i want you look -- 
i fiddle it . they got me down as an immigrant with <number> kids . 
it 's my place to offer advice , not yours -- and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it 's certainly not my situation that 's compromised , if that 's what you 're implying . 
an even <number> i throw in the jacket . 
young man , you will tell <person> <person> this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases ! 
and where are we ? 
i saw him on a talk show once , talking about these killers like they were his friends . not the victims , not the families of the victims , he does n't talk about them . <person> money , that 's what it is . did he hit on you ? 
yeah , you should have specified . 
the mall ? 
you will dine with me from now on . 
no , dad , you got ta tell 'em that they 're back there . 
why ? 
<person> my booyy ! when you 're really rich in what matters ... ... nothing matters ! my buyer has just made a killing in condos in the village . and he 's got a little stress problem ... ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet ! 
could you tell me when 's the next train ? 
listen , <person> <person> . i 'll run my business my own way . i got work . if you wanta take it , okay . if not , just sit here , that 's all . 
i think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you . and when you thought i was being kicked around , i wish i could 've seen your face . 
no . i 'm just a struggling <person> man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world . 
computer guy . 
yes , i think that <number> may be . 
can i open 'em up ? 
some or it . 
go ahead ! get a court order . then i 'm gon na sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution . 
georgia . 
oh , okay . can i call ? 
ever even been < u > in < /u > <number> ? 
i do n't know . 
you 've just done it - 
it 's a good job . 
you knew it was me all along ? 
wait a minute . wait a minute . 
it 's attitude ... how you carry yourself . 
no problems on both counts . 
<number> day he 's gon na find out what we 're up to with <person> <person> , and he could cause us a lot of trouble . 
that wo n't start no more fires . we might 's well go home . 
marriage can really complicate things . so , are n't you gon na say anything about my earrings ? 
what 's a chickie-run ? 
listen to me . we 've got to get help . the killer 's here . 
like father , like son . a serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that 'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs . <person> , so let 's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground . 
hi , i 'm <person> <person> . i own a -- 
i see . 
the theatuh , the theatuh- - what book of rules says the theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into <number> square mile of new york city ? or london , paris or vienna ? <person> , junior . and learn . want to know what the theater is ? a flea circus . also opera . also rodeos , carnivals , ballets , indian tribal dances , punch and <person> , a one-man band - all theater . wherever there 's magic and make-believe and an audience - there 's theater . <person> <person> , <person> , and the lone ranger , <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> and fontanne , <person> <person> , <person> and <person> , and <person> <person> . you do n't understand them all , you do n't like them all , why should you ? the theater 's for everybody - you included , but not exclusively - so do n't approve or disapprove . it may not be your theater , but it 's theater of somebody , somewhere . 
the little boat flipped over . a virus planted in the gibson computer system claimed responsibility . 
no . he got tired of pretending . 
my offer ? well i 'd say it 's a fair <number> , like i said we 're friends . all i want is my share , which i guess is ... 
you heard that <person> <person> o.d . 'd , right ? do you suspect foul play and stuff ? 
these are older women just dressed up to look young ... i think . 
see , that girl is in my favor . you heard me , nigga ? you fuck with her rough , and you got me to fuck wit . 
no ! 
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this . 
but they 're expecting us . it would n't be polite . 
the baptist got his name from drowning people for <person> . 
yeah . hey , <person> . 
anderton -- 
i 'm afraid i 'm not at leisure this very moment . just leave them with me . i assure you they will be quite safe . 
i do n't want you to lie . 
outside ? 
you were n't at harrison 's department store the night before -- 
thank you . 
come again . 
yeah but you do n't even know me really . 
really ? thanks . 
it 's their presidential suite . 
no i could n't , i have to have church approval , and frankly , that 's rarely given , - 
... but <person> , he 's looking for <number> years in tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out . he 's a good man . he 's only trying to do what 's right . 
backstabber ? 
then i 'll take it as a compliment . 
that 's abnormal . 
he 's going to kill her , <person> <person> . this morning , or maybe at noon , but today , and <person> 's our last chance . i 'm flying there , right now , unless you stop me . you want my id ? here - take it ... 
he seems to be headed for <person> . 
forensics people are sure of it . you have any idea who might have put him there ? 
you 're either having a seizure or you just said `` hello . '' 
please ? 
under him ? 
money , <person> <person> ? 
why ? 
this new learning amazes me , <person> <person> . <person> again how sheep 's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes . 
why should i help you ? you primates -- you great , lumbering , hairy animals , drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed ! a little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world ! you 're no better than the morlocks ! 
that 's their problem . 
ai , bueno . because i did n't want to tell you before , with your worries -- 
guys ... all we 've got is each other . do n't we know that by now ? 
well , <person> <person> ... from what i read of this here book , i 'd have to say the writin ' ai n't a whole lot different from the pitcher . 
-- do n't tell me about my world . you 're the one that 's afraid . you just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry -- 
good . i was concerned . 
i would n't be close to you . what is that perfume , girl ? 
because i do n't want to . it 's a stupid tradition . 
not at all . 
you said a woman could n't have done it . 
okay . 
all right , lothat , that does it . <person> safety on now until bomb run . 
who have you talked to ? 
it 's a simple subject . 
long gone ... marvosa well you wo n't mind if i do n't take your word for it , right ? 
it â€™ s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute , need a prostitute . you did the right thing . 
ja -- ja ! <person> <person> dead ! always mit the jokes ! <person> <person> dead ! 
... well , i 'd be okay in here -- 
no . but it 's somewhere without big worms . 
i mean , your amazement . i could have understood it in any of your companions , but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds . or is it that you fail to recognize <number> of your own dreams when you see it ? 
francie , you 'll learn that sometimes it 's best to stay low and just walk away . 
no . 
no . and ... 
i wo n't say anything . 
yeah . 
i gave it away . i thought , i 'm a writer now . 
all right , get him in a different room ; lock the door from the inside . i 'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes . <person> tight , and do n't panic . 
well , there was this <number> time -- 
did you ever want to ? 
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime , huh ? 
i 'm a nurse . i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital . dr. <person> 's on staff there . 
it 's everywhere . but water is always the door . 
okay , okay . the important thing to remember , is to think <person> . take your time . it may not seem like it , but the night is long . <person> enough . just think slow and think smart ... 
only <number> i can think of . 
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of . 
... fred ... 
oh , yeah . definitely . <person> toxic , highly carcinogenic . <person> , bad stuff . 
i 'm not listening ! 
i 'm sorry for what my brother did this morning . they 're assholes . 
thanks . 
this is where your background in police work comes in handy -- ask the questions , travers . 
good . 
what did you expect , lieutenant ? 
please . 
farewell , my cuz . 
but the white dot in the middle ; that 's got to mean something . 
you think he's.. ? 
the shark . 
have you been to the water board ? 
what 's wrong with that ? the fbi was very understanding when i explained it to him . everybody knows it is n't you ... it 's the pressures from your home life . 
i do n't know . except , it 's <number> of you . maybe not a panther , but it 's someone from the neighborhood . judge . <person> , just go . get away . it 's over . you lost . we all lost . 
how 's everything ? 
well , yeah ... ok , but you 're not listening to me . there are other things that need to be taken into account here . like the whole spectrum of human emotion . you 're just lumping everything into these <number> categories ... and , like , denying everything else . 
no . thanks anyway . i 've got to get over to the office . 
... those limp-dick ... < u > turncoat < /u > ... i < u > thought < /u > they let us out of there too easy ... .. 
then we 've got to get to the lifepods ! 
she 's not in love with him -- or any of them . 
<person> ... 
what if we could find bi-frost the rainbow bridge ? 
oh ? far as i can tell , a rumor does not travel alone for long here . 
my brushes , i have to clean my brushes . thanks , though . 
i do n't remember . we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period . <person> . 
good , i believe you already know my , uh , son -- 
yeah . how do you think i know he liked ... 
are you going to graduate school ? 
did you ? 
linda . 
he 's not gon na stop , satch . he 's gon na keep on ... 
okay , <person> . 
doctor , i attempt to conduct my social life discreetly . at the moment i am seeing no one . 
do you love her ? 
holly , we have to stop meeting like this . so that 's what it was . a fucking robbery . so why nuke the building , <person> ? 
... the river . 
where did you get that ? 
it 's a test . if i asked her to come and she came , it would n't tell me anything . if i tell her not to come , and she comes ... then i know she loves me . 
they 're harder to do than they look . 
well , could you lend me some money till you have <number> ? then i 'll teach her for free . that 's a promise . oh , i 'm sorry . i 'm being silly . <person> 's right - i should put a padlock on my mouth . seriously , is there any chance you could manage a loan ? only for <number> months , <number> at most . after that i 'll be the richest man in vienna . i 'll pay you back double . anything . name your terms . i 'm not joking . i 'm working on something that 's going to explode like a bomb all over europe ! 
huh ? 
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips . 
it 's okay with me , baby . but how ' you goin ' to like it ? 
i went for a drive . up in the hills . 
i insist on being told exactly what you have in mind . 
kinda like <person> and what's-his-name ? 
it might be best to have a man with experience . maybe someone who 's spent time in the foreign missions . 
it 's <person> ! 
fossils , huh ? 
no . i 'm new in town . 
we 've got to keep her away from that bastard ! 
she 's a good girl . she 's a little nuts , but she 's a good girl i think . she 's a little daffy . 
i swear on my life , i never said a word to her about you . 
i was afraid . 
i meant on the post . in general . how are you dealing with it ? 
he 's not a moron . 
or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken . you have to understand the loan shark 's in business the same as anybody else . he is n't in it to hurt people . he 's in it to make money . 
but you fellas never get a break , do you ? 
no way . i 'm so happy i 'm about to bust . here , honey . this is for you . it cost me my whole savings , but i said what the fuck . 
the point being : he 's also a candidate for my job . if we can pull this off , maybe i can restore their faith in me . 
i have . 
<person> . 
that 's all right . i was just ... 
and that 's why you 're leaving ? 
shaddup bitch .

but how can you respect yourself if you do n't ? 
how 're the hands ? 
otto ! you and <number> of those other fellows ! come help professor darcey . 
keep your friends close and your enemies closer . is n't that how the saying goes ? 
i got this gig through a contractor . and he most definitely did n't know who was doing the hiring , only that they were paying a lot of money ... 
welly , welly , welly , welly , welly , welly , well . to what do i owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit ? <person> rises .

i do n't want anyone to die . 
just leave me alone .

that 's fine , <person> . all in the line of duty . 
i do n't need a drug . 
who is he ? 
you think i have n't figured it out ? just because the cops are n't on to you yet does n't mean you 're home free . i 'm a veteran reporter . i 've seen your kind before , the underbelly of crime . 
who , <person> ? he spends more time here than i do ... 
ask him about the air . he looks out of breath . 
they come and go as naked as the day <person> created them ... 
what is it ? kiddie porn again ? sexual battery of a patient ? i 've had my license taken away in <number> states . 
he 's got some fucked up friends . 
i asked you to keep your trap shut ! 
life signs ? 
your lunch ? you have a luncheon appointment here ? 
sounds like he was a hell of a man . 
why is that ? 
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me ... 
your majesty , <person> <person> - 
[ <person> ] no , i mean in <number> days , i 'm supposed to die .

catchy title . what are you really reading ? <person> to believe that book 's got any parts worth highlighting . 
no superiors ! no scientists . no people from the future . it 's just a carpet cleaning company . they have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned . 
no . 
grazie , a lei , <person> <person> ! 
you think so ? 
rae do n't do this now ...

try the area around the wreck ... . 
why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction ... 
is leslie here ? 
i always knew that boy had an imagination , but now he 's gone and made up a whole new life for himself . do you mind if i sit down ? he 's been living with me and his uncle <person> since he was a baby . and we do n't live in manhattan . we live in boerum hill . in the projects .

honey , i ca n't track of all the meals <person> and i have been having . this is a delicate time . if it leaks out that i 'm jumping ship before i 'm set up someplace else i could be out on my ear before i 'm ready with nothing . with < u > nothing < /u > . 
but what if <person> survives ? 
who ? 
nothing . 
gallagher ! 
evidently to install bugs and photograph documents . 
what 's behind that beauty ? a wizened , cold-hearted snake . 
when i first met <person> , he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems . i do n't know what he is now . 
oh , i 'm sorry , wait a minute , i have something . well , what about saturday night ? 
quincy . i know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me .

whenever you lose , you get this attitude . but it 's just a game . 
huh ? 
delta . gamma . 
and the hell with it . it was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed . 
jennifer gave her a make-over . 
bad news . 
we will separate -- you look over there . 
no , my beloved , my child . 
you got an idea ? 
if you say , miss . and the enormous boat brought the long-ago fathers and the long-ago mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor . 
it was just words . 
okay . 
yeah , it 's a simple piece . if they get the floor done in time , me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon , but it 's not critical . 
well , we never made it official , so i guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend , but i was seeing him in school . i saw him at the mall about <number> months ago and i was too nervous to introduce myself so i followed him to his car , and jotted down the license plate number . it was registered to his mother , so i went to her house . she was so nice . i mean , she seemed like she would be nice <number> i never really spoke to her . i just waited til she went to work then i climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book . i say borrowed because i 'm going to give it back <number> day . but anyway , i called everyone in it til i found her son . he was n't home when i called so i left this message how much in love i was with him . i was , and how i wanted to have his children . just really opening up , and he never called back . i 'd call and call , and anyway , <number> months and <number> restraining orders later i just decided i deserved better . what about you ? do you have a boyfriend ? 
that 's cool . well-you <number> lovebirds take it easy , all right ? 
i saw someone standing in <person> <person> 's back yard . 
nice of you to offer , <person> , but certainly not . just relax and enjoy your coffee . i 'm sure <person> will be back soon . 
an ape ... some kind of ape . 
just some flies . 
he 's sick ? 
they must have made a visual contact . 
what toys do you have ? 
i know . you 're right .

oh , you could n't be more wrong , sweetheart . i can ' tell you how much i appreciate it and how i 'm looking forward to it . 
can i forget it ? 
jesus .

therefore , i shall ignore you . 
shit , thank god . you look like a creep . 
i 'm working my ass off here . i 've taken care of absolutely everything <person> . 
i know he does . 
cause i can get a job . i will . and you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again . would that make you happy ? 
he 's the last of <number> brothers , the other <number> were killed in action . this is straight from the chief of staff . 
here ? 
i do n't drink . 
i was merely drawing a parallel , <person> <person> . 
what is it now ? 
ligourin : how could you do it ? 
i do n't mean <person> . 
what about cable ? 
you know , <person> . 
where are we ? you know where we are . it 's called the beach . it 's where life first crawled up out of the sea . i come here sometimes ... when i feel like crawling back in . 
i ca n't survive in prison , <person> ... 
une erreur ! c'est gÃ©nial . c'est une vedette Ã  la tÃ©lÃ©vision . il peut aller partout sans Ãªtre soupÃ§onnÃ© ... en plus il a besoin de fric . 
but there 's no -- 
if you died right now , how would you feel about your life ? 
it â€™ s me , <person> ... 
yep . hey , i got a surprise for tonight . we 're going to the starlite in style !

int . darlene 's store - day . 
why was n't i insulted ? 
in <number> months , no one 's going to even remember this happened . 
nope , there ! that 's <number> . 
but the point is <person> -- well we know this -- <person> loves <person> and he misses her and apparently he 's come to his senses ... 
well , i 've got this story , it 's really good , i 'm working on , that is good , i feel it could be big , it this , eh , and it 's , you know , it 's incredible . am i right , did you say beyond recognition ' ?

jesus . <number> <number> <number> <number> thirty-three <number> <number> hundred thirty-three and change . 
lois , you 're amazing .

you experimented on your own , son ? 
you have a lot of secrets . 
she 's not in the gaming business is she ?

the what ? 
oh , yeah . they 'll never catch the guy . 
`` over -- '' you know - i can maybe understand , since i been gone , you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime , and for that i can partly blame myself . but what is baffling to me , is how , since i been gone , you 've become a complete and total moron -- 
'cause he did n't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to . that 's what the letter said . he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs . i thought he took care of us fine . <person> , did you really kill somebody ? 
what business ? 
you know why i 'm such a good officer ? because of my mother . have i ever told you about her ? 
did you make the plate ? ! 
no , sir . that girl in the cemetery ? my cat did n't kill that girl . i told you cats do n't go around looking for trouble . if that cat 's alive , it 's out in the country hiding under a bush , starving to death . 
the correct term is babes , sir . uh , this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech . otherwise penetration is not possible , sir . of the social infrastructure , i mean . 
rosen ? i do n't have a problem with that . 
goddamn it , <person> , would you please just shoot the nigger ! 
i need money .

there 's a carriage house around back . 
according to your girlfriend , <person> <person> , you and she were at the movies . you went to the restroom and you never came out . obviously , you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp , created by the original operation of the time machine .

i 'm fine , <person> . when are you coming home ? 
then take the justice from the judge , the bitter with the sweet , bonasera . but if you come to me with your friendship , your loyalty , then your enemies become my enemies , and then , believe me , they would fear you ...

when he made his decision , he could n't have known everything . especially not the way people like you do , who 've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . because you are blameless , you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . but you have no idea how people lived here . 
no . i feel something . 
terrible . boring . 
-- because i go there all the time . i do n't think i ever saw you before . 
tonight ? 
give it to me . 
<number> thing i 'm not completely clear on -- when you gave out the money to liddy , how did that work ? 
so you are . <person> is your pretty wife ? 
that 's not what i mean . 
be careful . do n't stay any longer than you have to . 
ah , well , i bought her this huge pumpkin for <person> , but she could n't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks , and it ended up under the christmas tree . 
a small loan would be welcome . more urgently , i need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me .

rusesabagina . <person> <person> .

that ... huh ... they just shoot you with drugs . 
your mother came in about <number> in the afternoon . her neighbor drove her , on account of your father was on business in wichita . you were born a week early , but there were no complications . it was a perfect delivery . now , your father was sorry to miss it , but it was n't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then , so i ca n't see as it would have been much different had he been there . and that 's the real story of how you were born . 
and the rule was ... 
do n't do that . i 'm not kidding . 
you know it . 
okay , stop . 
julie , that stuff probably saved his life . 
we need some help . i found something this morning . here . emergencies . <number> case of emergency , draw door . '

well , because i 'm curious . i want to know more about what you do here . <person> , there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation . for instance , the storage of noxious , possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement . now either you show me what 's down there or i come back with a court order . 
i do n't know . seems ... 
bonsai ! 
either you 've caught a cold , or you 're planning to kill me . 
surely you do n't think <person> was involved ! 
if you let him testify then it would have all come out . <person> was supposed to take care of it out there , shut <person> up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal <person> <person> , figuring if worse came to worse , he 'd cover for you . 
i do n't know , man . he 's a fucking character . 
total manipulation . i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution , but they do n't think along philosophical lines . 
what about sports ? 
lieutenant , the admiral is aware of the regulations . 
let my kid go . 
absolutely . 
right , if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent , but make sure i have a limo from my house , they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did <number> of these 
then you 're going to have to do it without me .

forgiveness ? 
go on foot . 
i 'm not . i do n't know what my name is . i do n't know who i am ! !

i saw his stuff in the bathroom . 
what the devil do you mean ? you have your lodgings , a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you -- 
call upstairs , see what you can find out . 
and did you have a close personal relationship ? 
shaddup ! <person> , what can i fix you ? 
well you were wrong ! it was your weight on the line that did it -- 
oh , you mean somebody who ai n't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun . and then what did they do ? camp out down below and just wait for him to die ? 
tell me something , anything . 
what about it ? 
i thought not . birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx , <person> <person> ; a <number> and <number> <number> years ago !

<person> and <person> ? 
ya know , those things to get attention , like saying that her bed shakes and stuff . 
but i 'm going to give it up for adoption . i already found the perfect people . 
it was not by choice . a small matter of a mountain falling down on us . we were trapped inside . when the time of the gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands . what you thought was the end -- was not . this is the end . we are the last of our kind , <person> . 
very possibly . come on , say yes . i 'll buy you a shirt . 
pearl 's junk . <person> gets mad when she plays out here and do n't clean up afterward . 
yes . the actual contract went to <person> <person> , the man that plunged to his death from the penthouse yesterday . he was to neutralize israel 's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart . <person> was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of dr. gregory gill , israel 's personal physician , who was also on the sparazza payroll . 
let her go ! 
yeah . 
i ai n't in a hurry . 
oh .

i 'm sorry . what was the question again ? 
here and there , <person> ? here and there like boston , chicago , <person> ? the bay area ? some action in london , 'til it turned nickel and dime . or how about that little stint down in miami ? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there . you guy 's pretty good ? 
manage the whole damn place some day . i 'm looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed ... . 
she upped and married some other cat after i joined the navy . by the time i got my discharge , though , she was divorced . her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel . 
not to me , you know that . 
i do n't like to talk about that . 
yeah . we need out fucking heads examined . 
what 's wrong ? 
keep going . go around to the back . 
well , you know , you do n't have to tell her everything . i mean , nothing really happened . we just ... took a walk .

so , i 've been thinking a lot ... 
i need you . 
no -- no -- i -- i -- i do n't want to see it . 
yes , she 's , she 's very warm , but , but it-it 's me that wants to be giving to you . i-i-i want to do things for you . <person> does n't need me as much . i 'm being presumptuous . not that you need me . 
yes -- the merger must go through -- but i am used to making my deals on a solid basis . i am not a liar . i am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- i have a sense of honor -- i have nothing to conceal . i could n't live happily otherwise . 
good night . 
yeah , yeah . good thing . 
but , they do n't speak english . 
do i want to be with you permanently ? yes , i think i do . but be with what you do and the way you live ? that i do n't know . c'mon , <person> , until i met you , coming back to <person> was totally 
in the can . the hoosegow ! mrs. <person> 's little boy . the pawk avenue wintons , you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi . he 's in the jail-house now ... 
they know they failed to kill <person> . security thinks they 'll try again , first chance they get . we 're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination . 
why not ? just <number> of the boys . sharing our bunks . eating our chow . right in amongst the ones that beat me up . except that he beat hardest . 
how do you want me to play it ? i 'm broke . 
as of now , and until you leave , you are <person> <person> <person> .

somehow i do n't think he stabbed himself in the chest , then buried himself too . 
'cause , <person> . i do n't want to lose you . and for some reason i get the feelin ' you 're about to split . permanently . 
no -- absolutely not -- 
when did you know she was the <number> ? 
in hiding . he sent <person> to talk to me . 
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as <person> intended ? 
just help , will you ? please god , help me -- 
from their tone of voice on the phone , i 'd say they 're taking us more seriously . 
that 's a good idea , maybe i will ! 
we ai n't gettin ' married with his ring ! you said you 'd changed ! 
that did n't sound like thunder . 
i know . women now , i guess . the commercial says they help women now .

they can know all they like , it wo n't do them the slightest bit of good -- 
you said a mouthful ... sweetheart ! 
i did n't mean it that way . 
i 'm gon na get your outta this . just hang tight . <person> ? 
thanks . to you too ... 
forget it . 
what a mistake ; people behaving like that , with guns . it was my understanding we left all that behind . but , let me tell you , the important thing is that you 're all right . good health is the most important thing ; more than success ; more than power ; more than money . 
yes ! do n't let 's get into this thing where i have to repeat myself ! 
they 're real goddamn good . they 'll be there for when ya need 'em . where are they ? 
we run that twenty-odd years . give it over to <person> <person> in <number> . april . 
i like to talk to the person who runs the service . can you give me address ? 
you too . 
and what if you get killed ? 
so you want a financial , is he a deadbeat , we can do a d & b -- 
why ? 
contrary to what dr. long may have told you , this is neither ... 
we do n't even like each other , do we ? 
i ca n't ! 
you need a nickname . 
and the <number> driving the other car ? 
that seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it wo n't kill him ? 
no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone . i 've been there . i 've seen it . 
panther ! same thing ... 
that was mighty charitable of you , <person> . looks like we both got fucked tonight . 
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst ! 
huh . that sounds great . unless someone else comes out with six-minute abs . 
great . i 've just started a new company . solid financing . it 's good . i love you <person> , you know that 
why not ? 
sing . 
hello . do you see anyone else around here with a band , <person> <person> ? <person> <person> <person> ? 
oh , i 'm really glad you called . 
no , but he was on the moors . 
forget it . 
easier than that , buddy . i 'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend <person> continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing ... pretty soon everyone 's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want . 
harder than i thought . took me <number> tries . but i was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along . after <number> bomb-outs , i found a place in the desert ... 
so it was n't real . 
they tried ... but i did n't let them . 
what happened to you after ... 
ah . 
the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball . and if you discover before a game you 're in the wrong nostril , it 's easy to switch . 
as far as you trust me . 
salvatore . <person> holding himself above . 
and did you ? 
they just said they wanted time . 
i did i killed a man . 
yes . 
skipper , uh , the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side . 
please , <person> -- there 's good reason . those water skiers ... . 
major , i hate to say this , but i think you 've been enemy indoctrinated , and you do n't even know it . 
do n't be defensive . 
why ? 
no ... 
i said horseshit . <person> . 
why not ? now that they 're kicking me upstairs -- 
oh , shit . 
why do n't we just tow it in ? 
then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys ? 
that 's probably the only reason <person> 's still alive . 
but ... 
i was at lena 's last night . you were terrific . 
what ? 
yes . what 's your name ? 
you left spacedock without a tractor beam ?

i have several jobs . 
wait a second -- 
no . 
i am underground . 
thank you , sir . although , i 'm afraid i do n't quite see how we can ... 
shoot him ? like with a gun ? 
well i figured that your password was `` finster . '' your pomeranian . and it was . and it 's all very interesting , though a bit on the technical side , i mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it 's gon na be <number> big giant ... 
i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again ! 
yeah , sure . 
hi , <person> <person> . 
you never wanted to go out with 'me , did you ?

gabby , what is it ? 
then what , what are you ? tell me ... 
so that 's it , just forget about us ? 
baby , you know how it is . i have to report to <person> <person> right away .

julie , you left <number> messages ... <number> . 
you try to frighten me , sir , admit so , sir . this is some new form of torture . say it , brother , sir . 
you 're off to a late start . 
no . we need the gig . 
some of you i know , some of you i 'm meeting for the first time . 
he 's jerkin ' us off . i think we 're gon na have to take him out . get ready to fire on my orders ... this is your last chance . give us the unit now ... 
<person> ? 
that was <person> <person> on the phone ? 
they know . 'just they do n't trust me with it . so we 'll get the evidence , first , ask questions later . 
it is ? 
only because i got pulled out early . 
if you ca n't make it back , i 'll hold up at the douglas shaft . stop worryin ' . you sound like a mother hen . 
what are you getting at ! 
i 'm going to work for your reinstatement ... 
what about narcotics ? 
yeah , could be . or maybe she thought we 'd have a lot to talk about . 
ooops . 
... and is dumber than my hind end . like that <person> <person> <person> ... 
i see . and where is my grandfather 's private library ? 
it has worked -- you 've given everything away -- i know where the poison is . 
what do you need from me ? permission ? go ! if you can fleece him for <number> <number> , then do it , <person> . 
i 'm afraid we may need more than that . there 's a bird of prey on the lookout for us . and she can fire while she 's cloaked . 
have n't seen much of you at the jail lately . 
me ? i 'm loaded with good ! i mean i 've never even used it . 
good . i 'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap . 
well , i 've brought you here . what now ? 
yes , you are . you 're very sick . 
what 's your name , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
there were at least <number> , maybe <number> . but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear . there 's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned . and a musician . and some others . 
hello , reggie -- i am waiting for jean-louis . 
yeah , in most cases that 'd be true . 
of course it does . 
well , first of all ... i got ta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a ferrari testerrosa . i mean , there is a lot of ` em on the street these days , and ... uh ... 
no . 
that little winona ryder manner ... you 're more convincing as <person> <person> . 
tell her they suit the weather better . their udders are black , <number> of pink . 
you 've seen it ? 
yes . but look at this medscan ... 
i 've read of it . 
no . i just got a messed up stomach . 
she 'll be worried about me . 
he drank it hot ? 
you 'd lie about anything . 
all about me ... 
now do n't get excited . do n't get excited ! ! 
okay , but it has to be a small <number> . 
why not ? 
that 's nice . 
i can take you down there . 
you have leave to try . 
basically , yeah . 
how are you going to pay when you get sick ? 
out blood oughta be fizzin ' like a warm , shook- up <person> .

he wants a reconciliation .

<person> wizard .

i shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when i was a boy , i had a passion for rafts , and never had the opportunity to build <number> . 
yeah . 
come on . 
you remember the '99 <person> <person> ? it 's the exact height of the front fender . looked right instead of left . 
i 've seen the manuscript . 
look pal , i 'm just askin ' how you ... 
you went for it . 
could be . 
so , it 's over ? 
<person> bay , sir . in the philippines . 
i 'm not convinced of that , <person> president , but your visit has raised my spirits ... 
i followed you to the maroon studios . when i heard those shots , i thought i 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk . 
jesus , <person> . i 'm not the enemy . 
it looks good , sir . we 've got an uncorrupted hard drive . 
how big it is ? 
they 're putting me on film tomorrow . 
that 's right . our motives are selfish , so we 're cooperating . 
well , you did n't have to go and hit me , did you ? is my nose bleeding ? 
did you take your clothes off ? 
what have i done ? ! <person> . 
as a matter of fact i was . you got a problem with that ? 
i do n't know . i do n't know ! 
he probably has a history of this shit . 
put her on . 
is it on `` delle croce , just off the corso '' ? you 're a quick study , are n't you ? last time you did n't know your ass from your elbow , now you 're giving me directions . that 's not fair , you probably do know your ass from your elbow . i 'll see you . 
i tell you , the best thing i can do right now is find out more about you . what your strengths are , your likes ... everything . what 's your best subject ? 
nobody gets fired . look at me . only thing they might do is transfer you to the bronx . you look like you aged <number> years since i rode with you last . 
you like the women , do n't you , <person> ? 
um-hmm . come with me , <person> . i want to show you something . 
yeah , but i was n't over . gim me the marker , <person> , i 'm marking it an <number> . 
remember when you asked me what my idea of `` normal '' was ? 
i 'm trying to make a metaphor here . 
oh , <person> . i must do more than that . i 've brought a present for you . 
<person> <person> was even going to let them kill <person> yesterday for biting <person> <person> . oh , please , professor , why ca n't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of europe ? 
that 's none of your business . 
<person> said ... norman ... what ? why are you looking at me like that ? 
coming to see me . are you trying to . . humiliate me ? 
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed ... totally without any pattern ... kill anybody ... the indian ... himself ... anybody ... 
c'mon , it 'll give us time to think about what they 're going to say . 
you mean , treat me ? cure me ? <person> , those words on the wall -- i 've seen them before ... i ... i ... dreamed them . 
of course . <person> <person> . i went to high school with you ... you played baseball , right ? you â€™ re doing well ... 
i 'm not some piece a crap . 
diego ? it 's <person> . 
a what ? 
probably safe in the hands of the federal government . 
you 're psyched . you need to lay off of that shit . 
no , i 'd be imposing on her , i 'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan ... 
must 've been after we got engaged . 
she 's not real either , is she ? nothing here is . nothing here matters . 
he electrocuted someone ? 
i said i 'd consider it . nobody owns me . and the last thing was insane . i do n't know what 's wrong with him ... no magazines . 
i expected action . there was no killing , no fighting , i was useless . 
maybe i should come back another time . 
geth thee to be and rest , for thou has need . 
that 's a pretty hairy ride . <person> <person> are supposed to be above that sort of thing . 
the park dude was missing an arm . 
that 's true . 
come on , you dumb son of a bitch . i 've got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us . 
stop worrying . this is going to raise your spirits . 
same to you . 
it is only too possible . <person> requires a mutual harmony which is difficult , and it is even more difficult to make it last . 
certainly , <person> dewitt ... 
what is . 
leave us alone , stephens . leave the people of this town alone . you ca n't help . 
<person> was my only shot at state ! 
if you wo n't do it for love , how about money ? forget the other offer and i 'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week . 
i did n't kill myself . i died from a blow to the head . how 'd it happen ? i have to know . 
how about another <number> ? 
that 's what <person> used to say . 
oh yeah . i 'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner , huh ? 
but i did . i 'm positive ! 
and i smoke . i smoke all the time . 
you ca n't figure me out . you 're the strange one.. 
i 'm sorry , mitch . 
what ? 
come on -- i 'll promote a card game , and we 'll be sitting pretty . 
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency . why ? 
that 's the key question . 
i guess . 
okay . 
good . this thing 's on track , looks like it 's gon na get done . 
exactly ! 
huh . 
man , if i go down you 're goin ' down with me . 
i hope i did n't disturb you . 
no . i love you . 
<person> fa ' fa ' away . to the east , beyond the lising sun ... 
<person> <person> ? 
because i was n't worthy . 
who said i was a lady ? 
when you 've finished medical school and you 're on your own , you can do as you please . until then , you will listen to me . 
love . 
<number> . 
tell me . 
i 'll go . you have the bridge . 
do you still think he 's innocent ? 
think about what you 're doing , <person> . are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons ? 
mrs. <person> ' fingernails and toenails . i think he took off his gloves , <person> . and dust all the corneas of all their eyes . 
<number> thousand . i kept half . 
nash . 
then why are you listening to her - 
do n't be cheeky , i 'll bind him to me with promises . come on , grandad . 
not exactly . i mean , he never paid me . 
harold ! 
you 've already stolen my heart , as well as another more prominent organ , south of the equator ... 
west <number> street . you have no idea what i 've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key -- 
you 're the guardian , are n't you ? 
order chinese for us and meet me the library ? anything but beef . 
no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! 
maybe you 're right . 
and remember this , <person> ! i love her , too . 
you know your weapons , buddy . 
<person> , miss . it 's gone . <person> 's face clouds . the crowds surge about her . she looks around thoughtfully . suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees , and the view then moves over to <person> , who sits on his suitcase , looking toward <person> . 
i hate you ! 
you work alone , savvy ? you ca n't handle the job , i 'll find someone who can . 
oh , hush up . 
brean , shaking his head . in the b.g. , moss , drinking . the tv comes to life . 
may i have your ticket , please ? 
no , not really . i ... 
the difference is for twenty years i thought <number> thing and now it 's another thing . 
fuck you , nut case . where were you last night ? 
they put up the least amount of struggle . 
i do n't doubt that the <person> was highly amused . she has always had a very healthy sense of humor . 
i 'll leave then , i 'll go to get something from my car , go away so you do n't feel pressure . can i ask you a serious question : 
jesus , what kinda broad are you ? 
boiler , can you set me up with some temp figures ? 
i wonder . 
well , bellerophon , it turns out , was only really effective against chimera . 
wait god-dammit ! 
thank you . 
give me a mirror ... 
an occupational hazard , i 'm afraid . 
there will be plenty of time to talk about it later . we 'll get married soon . that way we 'll have more time ... 
-- a slice of pizza -- 
that young lady 's size , right'cher . 
shut up and go home , will you ? 
uh huh , well ... good to know . <person> hands <person> a <number> note 
the wings.. 
oh for chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of -- 
lumbago . 
... mmm-hmmm . 
<person> scott , any progress on repairing our warp drive ? 
curious , is n't it ? what 's inside ? before i die , i 'd sure like to open it and see . 
no . we ai n't even ... 
it is urgent , sir . 
hey ! y'know what they used to call me in high school ? 
i suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it . 
olive . - where exactly am i ? 
maybe you can ask him to loan you the money . 
<person> <person> ... 
where to ? 
i-i never expected anything like this to happen ... 
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium - found in asia . 
besides . i 've been starting point the last <number> years . ai n't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot . 
who invited you ? 
he had the edge . the mind 's edge . 
i think ... about ... `` who 's the boss ? '' 
you 're not going to lose the house . everybody has <number> mortgages these days . 
how do you know she 's dead . 
-- it 's got ta be <person> -- someone from the white house had to be involved -- 
what i mean is , you think if , uh , do you think if i came back ... do you think you could forgive me ? 
do i have to ? 
you 're in a playful mood . 
have enough fun for the both of us . 
whoa ! ! i 'm so glad we got that on tape ! ! you wo n't answer a question about <person> , but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life ! ! <person> , what do you think she 's going to make of all these videotapes ? are you going to tell her about them ? i ca n't imagine her being too understanding about that . but since you do n't lie anymore , you 'll have to say something . 
well , it 's <person> . 
to take dictation -- a <person> <person> -- <person> , you -- tomorrow at <number> o'clock . 
well , they removed my heart last week , but i 'm doing fine except my nose fell off . looks a little funny . 
<person> karloff ! ? 
we 're great . 
do n't apologize . it 's great to see a woman really enjoying her food . i hate it when i buy a woman dinner and she wo n't even touch it . 
wade . 
well , how you doin ' , mr . <person> ? ! you sure are in the center of a storm . burning up lots of taxpayer 's dollars , too , i bet . on the news they said he was a white man . he is n't really , is he ? 
yep . 
you lied to me ! 
what <number> ? 
<person> is real . he 's been `` having '' me since i was <number> .

the mitchell barbecue <number> years ago . 
yep . 
straightening up indeed ! are you sure you 're not alone ? 
yeah , yeah , i sorta dabble around , you know . 
yes . from wendel . to celebrate , the license approval for our air-charter firm . i forgot to tell you . 
that 's good , memories are good sweetheart . <person> , i 'm sorry ; i was trying to keep it from you , i just could n't . you 're a good girl , and i want you to be happy ; do n't be an old grump like me . <person> in the morning . 
are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he 's dead . he 'll never get to trial . 
dies y nueve . 
oh , a very naughty boy . someone you and <person> <person> are most anxious to meet . 
pooh 's dusty , sweetheart ... he 's dusty , and you breathed him in , okay ? so what 's -- what 's happening to you now is ... cells called mast cells told your lungs `` do n't breathe any more of that dust in . '' ... and the airways in your lungs are like branches . and when the branches close up , you get an asthmatic attack . and , we give you medicine , and you get better . <person> ? okay ? you 're better already , are n't you ? 
ah-ha . 
anti-semite ! 
no , i could n't . 
do you love him ? 
i 'm not finding fault . it 's a good idea , good for you , good for the town . real modern too . 
do you have a soul-mate ? 
yeah ? 
i just need to use the phone , lady . 
did n't have to send me down a fucking mountain . 
holy shit ! 
you are , <person> . stop it . 
perhaps , that is true . 
then eat your spaghetti and i 'll tell you a luca brasi story . 
stop ! ! ! ! 
you ca n't testify . 
okay , okay ... 
i know all about you , <person> <person> . when you buy companies , they have a way of disappearing . even the pension funds are stripped clean . the last <number> companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces , widows were left without their retirement checks . 
observe . 
oh , i 'll bet you have . 
well , not in your mind , but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . . 
those targeting mirrors are frozen . the sun beam wo n't work . 
he 's right ? look , do n't try to put blood on my hands . you 've got <number> hell of a nerve siding with him ! 
shut up <person> . you 're not married yet . 
still working on being the first girl in the nba ? 
really ? i do n't feel so great . 
access established . 
little bit . 
yeah i 'd say c ... c . 
well , if you had to do it , you had to do it . what we do n't want is that bitch surviving on us . anybody but that woman . 
thank you , <person> . 
yeah , i 'm real glad you brought that up . i was going through your file here , and i ran into these medical records . they kinda surprised me -- 
you also have a power , conner . it is why you have survived . 
you did the same to your god ! 
scotland . 
oh it 's enough ... 
i 'm looking for some pacific-tech professors ... 
hello , <person> . 
oh , jackin ' off ? 
what ? why ? 
well i know you 're not crazy about taking <person> around tomorrow , so ... i just want you to know i appreciate it though . 
yeah , good . lem me just , uh ... 
ah , my dear napoleon , sometimes i feel that i am not really an emperor as you are . 
well , no ... but ... 
oh sweetheart , just a quick <number> . 
cute . 
that ca n't be , i have all the classic symptoms . 
the other working . 
what ? no . i 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms . 
his feet shall never cross my lips . 
how could there have been witnesses ? it was so dark . we were running and i fell and <person> went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere ... i do n't understand what they 're talking about . 
you fucked up , <person> . 
i ca n't believe you . you used to hate being the center of attention . now you 're proposing , in public , at a benefit . 
i just put them to bed . can we come to the meeting tomorrow ? 
you must be juliet . 
shylock ? 
they 're colored ! just to make him look silly ! 
that 's over . i got tired of translating everything . she thought the big <person> was a hamburger . 
to be perfectly honest , i have n't the vaguest idea . 
are you sure ? 
yeah , that 's comforting . <person> , too . 
what was the real purpose behind this venture ? 
nine days â€“ tuesday â€“ 
shit ! go ! 
well , i think if you take several lines out of context , <person> <person> becomes a very sexual movie . i mean listen to this . `` luke , at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ? '' or `` you came in that thing ? you 're braver than i thought '' . 
what ? are you all right ? 
this is a fleet-driven operation , son , and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground . you can have everything else , eh ? 
and , why is that ? 
it should be noted , sir , that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa . 
why do n't you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck ? 
you 're never going to believe this , but the canyon road ... we were on it not <number> hours ago ... well , it 's completely ... 
no , lil . it 's just you ca n't understand their brand of patriotism . 
she 'll go into coma . 
no . but ... when i look into his eyes , i can tell . 
i think it 's too late . 
i 've watched you - on verandahs , at garden parties , at the races - how can you stand there ? how can you ever smile ? as if your life had n't capsized ? 
ya say we 're acrost ? 
love , secret , and uh , sex . but not in that order , necessarily , right ? 
i 'm sorry . 
they are not weapons , my friend , but truths . you betrayed the duke , stole his wife and took his castle , now no one trusts you . <person> , uryens , your allies will turn against you . give me the child , <person> , i will protect him . go back to your war tent . 
i filed it yesterday . 
i -- i do n't know what to say . i know he 's under a cloud , but there 's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession . 
thank you , clarice . 
of course i recall <person> . in fact i 've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half . 
that was my plan . 
your body , your call . 
<person> <person> is staying for the weekend . in fact , i 've already invited her to dinner tonight . 
i killed <person> . i killed <person> , <person> . i killed <person> . oh my god , he 's inside me ... 
you know what they say . you have the same chance of winning whether you play or not . 
i try to imagine how they 'll look when they 're done . i try to imagine how we 'll fit in with them ... our place in the world . 
my car overheated . i pulled in to have it fixed . 
just do it ! 
courthouse back in town . 
i might break you , <person> <person> , but i 'd make you my dog 's bitch . you 'd be suckin ' the dick and going down on a mangy <number> hound . 
myra . 
do you still have it ? 
no . 
why do n't i call you when i 've got my calendar in front of me ? 
that 's not so good for you , my friend . 
the <number> to town is , but that 's about it . i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon . i told him who you were and what had happened . he said as long as there 's no infection , you 're not in any danger , and as soon as the road to the hospital is open , they 'll send an ambulance for you . 
are you scared ? 
probably . 
mood swing . i 'm manic depressive . 
captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it . 
a blockbuster . but quality . no mutants or maniacs . this one 's gon na be my `` driving miss daisy '' . 
that 's not the case . 
we shall double our efforts . 
i do n't want it to taste different . i do n't know why i bother . is that enough for you ? hey ! 
we 're running out of smoke . 
ca n't hear anything through that wind and rain . 
but , bishop ... 
switches are shorted out . 
no . <person> . <person> <person> . 
i 've seen it . 
money . 
what happened is that <person> went to meet a guy called <person> . he took a lot of money with him and he did n't come back . <person> 's partners think i set him up . i do n't know whether you know this teddy or how well - 
you 've looked a whole lot better . c'mon . 
she 's the boss . 
i know this part , keep reading . 
i remember everything . all i have are memories . 
i want to get money for you and the baby .

what about you , <person> ? how the hell 'd you manage to stay single ? 
why , daddy , you know my friend too !

i do n't want a <number> - i just want <number> . a perfect <number> .

i dunno . why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner ? . 
well , your children are very bright -- and *they* say <person> <person> . 
it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new . 
what ? 
sheila ? yes she was . is . was . 
and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor . ah me , how sweet is love itself possessed when but love 's shadow 's are so rich in joy . news from verona . how now , <person> ? ! dost thou not bring me letters from the priest ? how doth my lady ? is my father well ? how doth my lady juliet ? for nothing can be ill if she be well . 
now swing it out a little to the right ... 
i know . 
it 's not a joke . i 've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look , just come up and see him , okay ? <number> minutes , that 's all i ask . 
told her my name . then she said somethin ' like , 'it 's so noisy down here . why do n't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves ? ' she turned around and led the way . i knew i had an important lesson to learn that day . 
not our call , <person> . 
oui . 
i did n't `` shoplift the pooty . '' we were thrown together and -- i mean it 's <number> mutual people who -- <person> , i shoplifted the pooty . 
there might be . 
oh <person> <person> . 
what cowardice ! what treason ! <person> has ruined everything . how could they all lose their heads . they knew i was coming up fast . <person> was just within grasp . come , come , turn your troops around , general belliard . 
if you 're pausing for a `` thank you , '' give it up . so boss , you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means ? 
<person> <number> . 
thanks . i knew you 'd understand . 
what 's in it ? 
<person> matt , you have n't done anything about what you saw today , have you ? 
oh , that rumour about crosses ? 
christ . 
but if you call my house and my mother answers , ask for <person> . if you ask for <person> , she 'll think you have the wrong number and hang up . 
my mother 's name , actually . good question . you 've done you 're research . 
that 's all right , <person> . 
anybody could commit suicide , if he felt low enough . i 've felt it myself . 
how you treat them ? 
i am seventy-four years old . 
<person> ? but he 's a robot . i mean -- without you , what could he do ? 
no , thank you . i -- well , to tell you the truth -- -- i have this heavy date for tonight -- 
what ? 
where 's <person> ? 
<person> , let 's make love . 
<person> president -- 
that , <person> ? that 's another <number> - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm . 
i 'm sorry about <person> . 
what ? 
i 'm doing a favor for heather . a double date . i tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off . 
from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman . 
you would n't have taken me if i had n't been doll-faced ! 
you know -- your plan . 
i understand . i understand , thank you . -- how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser ? 
the emperor . 
she was never in new mexico . she never left the studio . 
yes , in theory , i suppose that would work . 
now : i 'm looking at the ... 
you bastard , i was believing you ! 
good . 
well , <person> _was_ in a canoe accident in <number> and presumed drowned . his mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer . some time in the early eighties , there were a string of murders out by crystal lake ... <person> started saying it was <person> ... back from the dead . 
where would i have seen your work ? 
what i do , i do for my queen . 
i 'm okay . 
oh , <person> , i do n't even know what i want . 
where did he conduct ? 
more nerve than the doctor , i must admit . he has n't been home for <number> days . has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television -- and the violin ? 
these kinds of things go on everyday at the networks , only you never see it , because they cut to commercials . now for sure they 're gon na fire me , so if you want to see me again , you 'll have to come to memphis ... 
that 's great , norther . i 'm happy for you . i ca n't believe i helped . 
sure . 
<person> on . -- and this is the good part ; when you 're fully ordained , he 'll come when you call him , too . <person> . 
the personal note is all there is to it . it 's all there ever is to it . it 's all there every is to anything ! stupidity in our government , complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you ca n't fight those things impersonally . they 're not impersonal crimes against people . they 're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue , <person> , that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers . 
i pay , too . they also pay who meet in hotel rooms . 
what about the other things you 've reported ? -- -- being followed on the -- 
to belong to someone . 
other ships , yes . but no experienced commanders . <person> , i need <person> <person> . 
drop the bogus forgery charge and i 'll forget about your generous friends slash clients . 
sure . 
tell ms. kramer what your daddy does . 
you 've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man â€” â€” working at him â€” â€” turning him against thea . 
you look way pretty , <person> . 
namely ? 
my father does n't answer . i have to go find him . 
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west . <person> was he supposed to say no to that ? 
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day . 
showing you what ? 
the <person> 's mouth . 
-- agent carruthers . do you know where is he now ? 
that 's ... wonderful . it 's just ... i thought ... 
uhura , monitor ! 
well , i did n't actually see him do it . like i said . 
oh , i 'll try ! <person> , i will . 
we have to do something . what can we do to help , selina ? 
i 'm going home ! 
not us . not human . get it ? something non- human , but intelligent ... 
<person> laszlo ? 
i dream 'd a dream to-night . 
more to drink ! 
i think she would cheer . 
hey . i 'm a professional . 
yes . i do n't want them . i 'm not looking for analysis or drugs . it 's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis . it 's more than that . i can feel it . i need you prof. you 're the only <number> i can talk to . 
what ! you ca n't be -- 
where 's <person> and julia ? 
i am not living with him . i 've just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i 'm doing . look , this has nothing to do with anyone else . you know that , do n't you ? i left because we were n't exactly getting along , and we were n't talking about it . and i suddenly realized that i like my job , and i like what my life is could be turning into , and that i 'm getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i ca n't really see that ever happening with you , and yeah , yeah , i sort of get interested in someone else , and that went further than it should have , so it seemed like a good time to go . but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run . probably nothing . 
dead . all dead . 
she calls him <person> ... 
no . they asked who i was , then told me what corner . 
oh god , mister , please leave me alone . 
how do you mean , strange ? 
you fucking bastard ... 
and you 're our thirty-percent partner ? 
because someone may have gotten away . 
gee whiz -- 
my car ! my car ! tan ciera ! 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
hildy ! 
i do ? oh , is n't that sweet , thank you . i have to confess something to you . i must have been pretty plowed at your wedding . i really do n't have the faintest idea who you are . 
does he have your number , <person> <person> ? 
you should be ashamed of yourself . 
it 's good with coffee . 
to the place where <person> lives . 
of course -- 
to be the wife of a poor player ? -- can i wish that for <person> <person> , except in my dreams ? and yet i would , if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day . 
you quit high school , lie about your age , join the navy , and next thing you know , <number> years are up and you need a way to make a living ... 
hello . 
nah , i did n't really want it anyway . i just wanted to order it . 
about twelve <number> . 
she 'll come , pard . a rich socialite oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts . 
i guess not . you 'll be heading east from here , huh ? 
... can not go on the air . 
i ... it used to be , when i was a kid , what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs . <person> and death , right and wrong . when someone called the fire department , we came ... those guys do n't know how much i love them ... you do n't leave people hanging ... cause that 's what it 's all about . it 's loyalty . it 's 'till death do us part . is n't that what you heard ? ... it 's you go , we go ... cause without that , it 's the end of families , it 's the end of the fire department ... and when the fire department stops coming ... that 's the end of the fucking world ... i 'm sorry i came , <person> , it 's just ... it 's just there 's nobody i can talk to ... i miss you . 
aha - very good , freshie . [ <number> ] very good . you 'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later . 
i 'll go down and speak to him . 
there 's got to be an explanation . it could be a magnetic flux or something , maybe the power lines are giving off something . who knows ? i do n't know , i think it 's kind of interesting . 
when you call me <person> , i know i 've got trouble . 
hilarious . 
serum -- it 's a human hemoglobin substitute . 
not down here . i 'll start trusting you when i feel there the time is right . it 's not personal , it 's just survival . 
oh come on ! 
put it on the veiwscreen , would you please ? 
why ca n't the idiot in circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place -- -

you do n't make enough . 
she ... left me alone with that little thing , and i looked at it , and i thought this is a mistake . but it 's my mistake , not <person> 's . <person> 's mistake . 
we bought you . 
we ca n't just leave them here . 
nothing . just the cyclist . he 's passed us . 
well , if you do , you 'll let us know ? 
then what are you doing here in bodega bay ? 
what 's your fucking problem ? you 're a shithead ! 
that 's what he keeps telling me . 
that 's not for you to decide . everybody 's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- the police will want his description . is this a picture of him ? 
yeah , yeah , you 're a fucking phony , mcmurphy !

francesca , listen to me . you think what 's happened to us happens to just anybody ? what we feel for each other ? how much we feel ? we 're not even <number> separate people anymore . some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people do n't even think it exists and you 're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do ? that staying here alone in a marriage , alone in a town you hate , in a house you do n't feel apart of anymore -- you 're telling me that 's the right thing to do ! ? 
i was quite enjoying that .

<person> , we 're going huntin ' . 
he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility . and you do n't understand that he 's at a fragile point -- 
shut up , i 'm trying to watch this . 
this person and i are a thing of the total past . i promise you . 
i think these rich shits -- no offense <person> -- are so dead below the waist that they got ta ride around all day swingin ' at each other ta get their broads hot .

i -- i must 've misplaced it . 
you should have tried harder . 
<number> <number> ? but the scoundrel owes me seventy <number> . 
that 's right . 
do you know how ridiculous you sound ? first of all , it 's illegal for u.s. citizens to buy gold . and in the second place , the price of gold is regulated by the government . 
what if it takes <number> minutes , norman ? what if it takes an hour ? and he can fight it off ? we ca n't afford that . 
you do n't understand ... 
well , now , darlin ' ... give me a chance to defend myself . 
i would like to know the contents . every detail is important . 
yeah , they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then <person> hits it again in the kitchen .

what did you do while the sergeant was killing your son ? 
you can trust me completely . 
oh yes ? -- navigator better than those on richesse.. you are transparent ... i see many things ... i see plans within plans . 
to rise so high , in so short a time , is a dangerous occupation . a little hypocrisy goes a long way . 
go for it .

you know it 's <number> thing to treat us this way , but how can you do this to your fans ? ... 
yeahâ€” yeahâ€” i guess i doâ€” but there 's a lot more to this whole thing than i thought , <person> . 
<person> did . he 's the perfect suspect , do n't you think ? 
no , you ca n't , and i think that 's the whole problem with aliens ; you just ca n't trust them . you may get some nice ones occasionally like <person> or e.t. , but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard . anyway , we 're just about out of time . next week on 'world of the psychic , ' hairless pets . until then , this is <person> <person> saying ... ... good night . 
<person> lester know about him ? 
it 's mostly done , they got nobody in common , the <number> of them ... no mutual friends -- the landlady says nobody was ever there , she never saw her with anybody . 
for once , to write something and have it realized completely . for once , not to compromise- 
you got it . it 's <number> dollars a man . be on the campus in urbana at <number> o'clock - 
despite all your talents , you are still a novice in the ways of family . <person> follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course . you must learn to trust him . for that is the nature of family . 
the hall of books . 
you said , you were in the bad lands ? 
it 's okay , <person> 
<person> . 
we have his note . 
i have a feeling there 's some very interesting space behind this door . 
reggie -- trust me once more -- please . 
we 're doing something -- ? 
but you ca n't ... you . 
tom . .. bed ! go on . 
is that it ? is that it ? you want to do business that way ... ? 
yeah , i guess so . 
i 'll try , but this week we go into survival training , so i ca n't make any promises . well , thanks again for dinner . thank your mom again for me , will you ? 
come on , do n't bullshit me . 
of course . but only on monday nights . 
not if you see them for what they are , <person> . 
what ? 
pack the bags , we have to move . 
the picture 's dead . 
boss , then i 'm afraid i ca n't continue working with <person> . 
please go back , bring the children to us . 
i may be the outlaw , but you 're the <number> stealin ' my heart . 
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast , and determine what 's to be done with him . 
a message from <person> <person> . 
least i work for a livin ' . why 'd you get fired ? 
her family ? oh , they 'll be all right . i 'll bring them around . gilded cage ? ! besides , i 'm not marrying her family . <person> <person> in a gilded cage ! <person> <person> ? ha ! that mug . what does he know ? 
what do you know of my pain ? 
let us go and we 'll make a deal . 
<person> 's not coming . 
yeah . to go to school and , you know , paint , performances , paint . 
probably . but when i do , it 'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress , a lobster dinner , and the latest scandal . i need a woman who 'll go anywhere , do anything , and love it . 
it 's enough that you 've brought yourself home ! 
sure , that would be cool . friends . 
all he can . all he can . 
i 'd like yours too . 
that 's impossible ! it was ruint when i got here ! you ruint my life ! 
i think our best course right now would be to focus on the probation officer 's report ... 
is he all right ? 
oh , you 're a piece of art , <person> . they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere . or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you . 
you a fine lookin ' woman , <person> . i bet you do a damn sight better than okay . you think anybody followed you ? 
i saw it . 
no . i 'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again . 
she did n't give me a chance . 
i 've always thought you were a pretty nice guy , <person> . i 'd like to go on thinking so . if you tried to help her get away -- 
that 's because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos . 
my ex-husband works in satellite communications . 
you 're worried about recouping the loan . i already told you . 
yeah , and whose fault is that ? 
i 'm trying to tell you . it 's on the lady 's pillow ... 
no , just riding bareback , that 's all . <person> , you might try the oak pass or <person> <person> <person> . sometimes at lunch <person> takes walks around them . otherwise he 'll be home by <number> . 
i did n't even like her , to be honest . 
it 's my favorite . 
<person> christ you 're right . 

<number> wakes off the back of those boats . who runs <number> sterling engines off a deep-v hull ? 
who ? 
in a few weeks , it will have started or it wo n't . if there are still baseball games and traffic jams , armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we 'll be so happy , we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police . 
which question is that ? 
you 're the one who 's helping *me* , homer . you 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while i 'm gone . <person> , too . 
oh , you are ... 
yes , <person> . i have seen it before . it happens to old people . 
i do n't know . <person> on you man . <person> <person> . 
it takes that much time to process the order and make sure it 's valid -- 
maybe <person> was n't so crazy after all . 
does it ? 
six fuckin ' car lengths ... that 's about a hundred and six fuckin ' feet , mister ! you were following ten feet behind me ... if i 'd had to stop suddenly , you would have hit me . i want you to get a driver 's manual , and i want you to study that motherfucker ... and i want you to obey the god damn rules . fifty fuckin ' <number> people were killed on the road last year . cause of fuckin ' assholes like you . tell me you 're gon na get a manual . 
they asked who would be best suited for this and you -- 
when i am sure i am among friends . 
no , they 're not . 
yah , so we 're all set . 
the rest of the family was crazy as <person> <person> . 
i can write it . i ca n't type it . 
not exactly , sir . you see , colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago . he asked general ripper if he had issued the go-code and the attack order , and general <person> said : `` sure , the orders came from me . they 're on their way in , and i advise you to get the rest of <person> <person> in after them . my boys will give you the best kind of start , and you sure as hell wo n't stop them now . '' then he hung up . 
she 's a little sad , is all . 
er , <person> ... the thing is ... i thought your son was a lady . 
it 's ... i do n't know . 
-- <person> , if i were to say to you i have n't seen <person> <person> ii yet , what would that mean ? 
ah , no ... for me , love comes first . i 'm a man , and i know what 's what : first love , and then music . 
you sure ? 
<person> <person> ? 
<person> <person> did n't make it , <person> . he died . 
i wrote . not every week ... 
you told me no calls . 
i make thirty-one <number> dollars a year . 
all right , <person> -- quickly -- hurry . 
oh , i see . but you 're not <person> . you 're <person> <person> , the picture writer . 
well , give it to me then . 
it 's <person> . 
yeah , i was gon na tell you to shut up . 
do n't ever forget how good you are . 
yeah . 
that 's right . i told you we had a fight -- that 's what it was about -- <person> <person> -- you know that other girl you saw -- 
the people are great farmers , as well as inn-keepers . 
it was with this sword that my late father , <person> <person> , <person> rest his soul , met <person> <person> <person> , the hampshire baronet , and was fatally run through the neck . he was quite in the wrong , having insulted <person> <person> , when in liquor , at the brentford assembly . but , like a gentleman , he scorned to apologize . 
no dude . 
no wait . <person> . 
ai n't nothin ' gon na make up for <person> , kid . <person> is for suckers . i been griftin ' <number> years and never got any . 
if i throw too hard i 'll hurt the kid . 
... <person> president , how good to see you . 
we need to find a way to make me part of it . 
oh -- too bad . did you quarrel ? 
deputy director <person> opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope , risking high-profile failure . better to get rid of me . then he could be mr . <person> <person> , <person> <person> on deviant behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of <number> <person> <person> . do you really think that plane crashed by accident ? do you really think i was n't on it by accident ? i 've always had a good sense of intuition . 
absolutely . and she 's got great tits . 
where 's your dress ? 
really ? 
that 's all ! 
i got a few nite owl questions . 
like you could n't believe . 
well , then , you must come back and visit . 
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable , dr. singer . 
of course not . 
you 're unlucky . 
her name was <person> . 
so . what then ? you just detach sex from everything.. 
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side -- is that better ? 
that 's more like the old sally -- a little bit of fire . how about <person> ? 
well , your prediction was on the nose . 
neil , thank you for your help . 
you know what ? this is good . this is terrific , and i 'll tell you why : it 's < u > cost effective < /u > . this is ... . 
nobody 's going to do that ! 
that was stressful . i found that stressful . 
you were there for me . 
it 's a farce . 
oh , i 'm more than sure . anything happens to <person> 's horse i can tell you right now you do n't wan na be the party that was aboard . 
oh , hell . drink ? 
so am i .

that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt . now how could somebody get to it without you knowing ? 
well , yes , <person> is a wonderful hairdresser . 
as the wife of <number> of our party . 
... friggin ' fish . 
and miss all of this peace and quiet ? never , right hal ? 
that 's your friend <person> ? 
i do n't think so . the only trip i 'll make in space is around the sun -- -- on this satellite right here .

i 'm so happy for you . takes the edge off , does n't it ? and where might your date be ? 
the numbers stop at <number> . 
i do n't really want to talk about it , <person> . 
i do n't have to . i 've got them right here . 
i thought you could n't leave . i thought you could n't get your car . 
your royal highness . 
this is all about fashion for you , is n't it ? 
yeah . 
i do n't mean to be rude , but ... 
i 'm just not <number> of those guys who has a `` type '' ... 
it 's on the boat . he 's holding a press conference tomorrow . 
-- that ca n't happen . <person> does n't want him to have the money , the things . 
no sir . 
listen to <person> <person> <person> . out there in the free world . 
how 's that ? 
nah . 
insane . 
it 's everything we wanted . a very good read . a terrific piece of work . so , here 's to you and suez . 
in <number> more years i 'll have an engineering degree . we 'll sell the store , we 'll move away from burnfield and the store and you standing here . 
excuse me a minute . i 'll be right back . 
<number> thing at a time . we do n't even know what it is yet . 
did they ever find out who they were ? 
whaddaya mean , give it to me when we leave , give it back now . 
good . no more nightmares for either of us then . 
finally ! so you 're our canadian pickpocket ? 
what can i do ? except maybe pass out ? 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
of course . 
from what i understand , it 's pretty much whatever we want . 
... up ! 
oh , madame ! this is a restaurant , not a meadow . 
george , i 'm sorry . 
and what did you discover ? 
any time . 
not at all . 
<person> ' , brother . <person> ' .

a little basic , but nice . 
conklin up front . 
the same old , same old . trying to get my stuff through . 
yeah , i know him -- the kid that was with him . maybe you do too . <person> <person> . he works for lariviere with me . he 's my best friend . 
i was informed just as <person> was about to leave the hotel , so i knew i 'd be on time . 
you 're convinced the crew could still be alive ? after <number> years ? 
excuse me ? 
... <person> is a mystery ... 
i have a passport . i 've got ... actually , it 's a little complicated . 
absolutely . 
they ... they killed him . i ... thought you know that . i thought you knew because ... 
of course . 
have we had trouble there before ? 
i 'm the guy who 's going to kill your daughter if you do n't get moving . 
it 's about time we did ! it 's about time <person> realized that what 's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off . 
right . 
no , thank you . 
i forgave you the moment you said it . 
it keeps me busy . everybody always wants something . 
of course ... i have n't got the energy to get out of town that fast . 
this meeting is adjourned . 
[ aurillio rosas sanchez . ] 
i never thought of that . 
yeah , just a cigarette got in a wastebasket . 
sure . 
c'mon seymour , i 'm trying to collect data here ! do n't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl ? 
yup . 
cool , can i get <number> for <person> ? 
affirmative . the hull 's intact ... but there 's no gravity and the thermal units are off line . i 'm showing deep cold . the crew could n't survive unless they were in stasis . 
help me in ! 
no . 
you 've made a considerably wise decision . 
yeah . fuck it , <person> . 
what do we need another shill for ? 
yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the delta . 
reed , i 'm not talking about <person> . 
clark , you come on out here ! ! 
oh -- i almost forgot ! 
you 're a wimp . 
thanks for clearing that up . i hear your former girlfriend is going out with <person> <person> . 
just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is . you forgetting something ? 
fuck off . i do n't know what the hell you 're talkin ' about . 
honey , all the great ones came through here at <number> time or another . 
like hell you will . you 'll buy me a cab . 
yeah ? 
what were you gon na say ? exactly how did you think he was gon na make the leap from dating a sweet , innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star ? 
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more . 
<number> weeks work gone for nothing . 
are the tv people with you ? 
oh , see , i meant someone you 've had sex with . that 's part of the theory . 
what 's the line on visitation ? 
me ? sure i do . 
uhura . get me through to <person> <person> . 
they 're dead . 
what are you thinking , calling me at home with a message like that ? you 've compromised me and our relationship -- 
and decent . 
well we know that but what 's he doing here ? 
not the first time that 's been true . i 'm telling you , i got a feeling about this guy . this is the guy , satch . 
where to ? morgan stanley ? <person> ? what ? 
the manager , he 's diabetic , he 's lookin ' bad . 
... blind as a tiberian bat . what do you make of the plantoid beyond ? 
yeah , i was wondering why he should do that . 
however ... you 're gon na be subpoenaed to testify before the un-american activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles . now , if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear , they 'll clear you . 
who is to say our morals are better than hers ? but maybe you 're right . she could ... influence <person> ... 
absolutely . well , that might be kind of tough . once the press starts smelling blood ... 
listen . <person> , longfellow . you 've got brains , kid . you 'll get along swell if you 'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut . do n't talk to anybody ! these newshounds are out gunning for you . 
oh yeah , i remember now . 
there 's no mistake , <person> . if you veto their funding , it 's not a mistake . if you hurt someone intentionally , it 's not a mistake . 
no . 
the hotel guy ? it 's been in the papers lately . his kids are all suing each other over his estate . he was a total recluse , paranoid , rich as hell , he was worth thirty <number> or something , now it turns out they ca n't find half of it . <person> took something did n't belong to them ! 
oh , how is he ? 
frank , you look a little peaked . wan na vomit ? 
the envelope -- imagine that . mrs. <person> , listen to me -- you 're not safe as long as you 've got these stamps . go to the embassy right away -- wait , i 'd better meet you halfway -- it 's quicker . now , let 's see -- do you know the center garden at the palais royal ? -- yes , by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there . <person> , mrs. lampert . 
you and <person> used to come out here together ? 
my mother -- she lives in detroit . come on now -- give me those stamps . 
eh ? ... oh . 
yes ... <person> . 
swishes . they swish , y'know . young fags , you know . they 'd come into my bureau needing help , no bread , and i 'd say , hey man , i ai n't <person> , who gon na back you up ? these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial ... 
no . 
`` be there ? '' 
i look like some hoochie to you ? i found it on your floor . 
your face ... are you hurt ? 
worse since she talked to who ? 
there 's somebody else on this boat .

do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men 's beds ? 
he 's in back . lying face down . they have n't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying . i never heard <person> cry before -- 
<person> ? christ , he could fuck this whole thing up ... what does he think he 's doing ? 
do n't . 
... we did everything we could ... 
this is a real piece of shit . 
i do n't know ! <person> ! let 's just play it by ear . he may not know . he may just give me a ticket . 
oooohhhh . 
stop worrying . i do n't think they 'll bother to come after us . 
winners do n't do coke . or have n't you been reading the bumper stickers ? 
i came on at <number> . 
i 'm cool . 
oh she 's a beauty . 
they ca n't shoot us in here . 
gotcha ! 
damn it , he was doing you a favor . you know how hard it is to find someone who does n't think you 're completely crazy ? what are we supposed to do now ? huh ? where are we supposed to go now ? 
<person> keitel . yeah . maybe . he was pretty good in the movie `` fingers '' . 
come on , man . i 'll make a sailor out of you yet . 
i 'm soldier of the republic , you 'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo . a nation once again . 
... he did what he was told . 
that just makes you more gullible . 
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country . 
pretty terrible shot . 
jane , there was an envelope in my desk . the <number> i â€™ d given you and then got back , remember ? i can â€™ t find it . do you know where it is ? 
yeah , i 'll do you a favour . 
shark bait . draws them over for closeups . 
i ... i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to make a joke of it . 
i quit . hit my dinger and hung 'em up . 
now do n't give me a hard time . 
oh . 
do n't take it so big ... it is n't a tragedy . 
shit . let 's drink to something else . let 's drink to fuckin ' . say here 's to your fuck frank . 
<person> <person> ? no , no . he 's the reason i 'm in here , <person> . for all i know , he 's got a record a mile long . i got a better shot of getting out of here on my own . you tell maynard to think about me , concentrate on me . understand ? 
i know . 
i 'll get wally to show me sometime then . 
not good . 
what nurses ? 
how you know that ? 
because i 'm expecting a call . 
<person> kenny , i 'll bet you a <number> dollars you ca n't light a fart on fire ! 
yeah , uh , listen . why do n't you go upstairs and keep your mom and <person> company for a bit ? i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment . 
letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous . 
your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight . and the tide rushes in . 
sightseeing . 
< u > <person> < /u > ... yes . we 'll be back ... ? 
it 's still a little early for me . 
that 's very generous . 
yeah . i 'm -- i 'm okay . 
yes , please . 
tis the truth . 
enough of this . we stay together . let me rest , i will feel better then . 
what 's this , <person> ? 
now we wait for <person> to make his next move . 
resistance ? 
... to me . i think i 'm dying . 
now everything 's fine . she 's probably squawking her head off in some police station . 
whose law ? the law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle . 
come again ? 
i thought maybe you 'd like to hear a song . 
think of your health , <person> - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track ... 
uh huh . under a safe conduct from me . 
are they standing for me ? 
well , do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are ? i mean , maybe they do , but i doubt those people are in therapy . besides , being happy is n't all that great . my figure is always at its best when i 'm depressed . the last time i was really happy i put on twenty-five pounds . i thought <person> was going to have a stroke . 
you have to . it 's a tradition . 
it 's the truth , jake . 
<person> 's the little boy who lives in my mouth . 
no , no . it 's not ... are you still on the pill ? 
this is commander donatra of the valdore . we 're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies . 
we have to go after them , find where -- ! 
they have repressed the creator . 
i do n't know . i ca n't get the dialect . 
no ... how long did you say ? 
let 's make more popcorn . 
an animal that does n't procreate . it spreads , grows . a living disease . 
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god , and he told me that i -- <person> -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france . 
it 's been a while , sir . here we go ... retrothrusters ! 
none of the above , thank you . 
mcmasters , is n't it ? <person> , you seen a black stallion with- 
i just got goosebumps . 
do n't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases . 
funny . 
everybody 's paying top dollar for scraps of paper , refrigerator doors â€“ anything with a samo tag on it . the other day , i just wanted a pack of cigarettes , so i did a drawing and sold it for <number> bucks . a week later this gallery calls me up : `` somebody 's offering us the drawing . should we buy it for <number> thousand ? '' 
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word ? when he put me in that trance ... 
it â€™ s i who should thank you -- for taking that money back to mi-6 . so distressing for m. an explosion inside her lair . 
oh , but <person> . the music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- that 's life -- 
it 's only a tale . 
huh huh . this says <person> . 
you have to . do it now ! 
he 's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in . he 's the one that caused <person> to come and <person> 's fucking us real good . i just feel so horny . i 'm supposed to be here watching you why ca n't i be here fucking you . listen . i know his cock 's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing . let me wet my whistle , baby . 
when ? 
'fraid so . just a regular old ... mud carrier . 
that 's preposterous ! 
-- he wo n't . 
bosun ! set up <person> <person> 's quarters , nice and fine ... in the brig . meaning no disrespect , of course . 
where 's the sphere ? 
i can keep the beat . 
i was the first <number> to see it . i was coming down the stairs , and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet . 
i see . 
[ the address is <number> south rane . it 's a lively address . you got a problem with dark meat ? ] 
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me ? 
i have ! 
no -- s.e.r.a . 
i 'm fine . 
jackie - what are you talking about ? 
i 'm not sailing his boat . 
well , teacher 's away and actors will be actors ... 
with some difficulty . i had to promise them you were not a total fool . 
what do you want for free ? 
okay sure . what about ? 
yes , he does . may i try ? 
is that its mouth ? 
he does bless me , each and every day . <person> 's mother works a hospital shift , so i pick him up at school . we stop for a meal usually around this time . he does his homework and gets some experience meeting people . but we never had a famous mobster before . 
kane ? charlie ? where is he ? 
fine . <person> , what the hell are you doing ? you 're bothering the serial killer . 
oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it . 
they 're fine . 
all the time ? 
hey , i 'm so sorry i 'm not the stud that you are . 
yeah . 
look , the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case . may i make a suggestion ? 
and what had you done ? 
no , i did n't , i , that 's no . no , i- i-i , no , i-i just ... hate to see you put yourself in a position where , where you get hurt , you know . you know , you know how you take ... 
something . 
oh great , i ran out . 
now , really - 
you get paid to do what we say . 
very cool . <person> . 
dwayne . 
learning language . 
and with that complete loser 
okay , <person> ... it 's okay . 
i 'm not that good . 
keep him in cold storage till the reports in . then send him to taxidermy . he 's a museum piece . 
what ? 
respect , my ass . they respect honesty . you see how they dress when they go out ? they want to be noticed . you 're just showing them it 's working . you got ta get off this respect kick , baby . there ai n't nothing wrong with letting them now that you 're money and that you want to party . 
i was giving him some advice is all . preparing him for life . you do n't want him to grow up soft , ev , it 's tough out there , it 's a goddamn jungle . 
ted ! 
i 'm sick . that 's what i 've been telling you . 
major , he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect . 
i 'm afraid . 
no , no ... i did that ... 
how can i tell you what i do n't know ! 
you , frank . all these years you been telling me we 're different . we got novelty , <person> . no one can touch us . 
okay , let 's drop it . i did n't mean i 'd take a test for you -- i mean if that came up in conversation i 'd ... 
i think i already have . but now she wo n't even talk to me . 
you mean the drug money ? yes , i got it . 
tension . it 'll go . 
i know a very good dentist . 
guess . although , what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now- 
like what ? 
you was n't with her ? 
then it must be wednesday . 
we 're coming your way , man ! 
okay . that 's bad . 
when did you talk to <person> ?

there 's no danger . the black hole is contained behind <number> magnetic fields , it 's under control . 
we figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . after that , there 's not much hope . we want a rescue operation mounted tonight . that does n't give you much time . 
i did n't want to say goodbye to anyone .

affirmative , sir . negative , sir . they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals . 
it 's from the machine . all they need is the crystal to run it and they have <number> of it already . we ca n't let that happen . 
i think we should be careful . consider his emotional response . 
<person> , . i 've been trying to postpone this . but what 's the point ? it 's over . i do n't want to hurt you . this is very hard for me . i 'm doing this for both of us . i really want you to be happy . 
i tell you , we 're going west , and shanghai is east of here ! 
we 're at <number> and a half miles , so you 're just a little over a mile from where you want to be , <person> until minus <number> minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time , and it should be close enough to zero hour that they ca n't do anything to stop you . park the truck at <number> and get in the refri -- the time chamber . just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb ... .the power converter will do the rest . 
he 's all yours . i 'll do <person> and gideon . take jean-louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside . 
you did . well ... thank you .

sir , about leaving -- 
that was <number> <number> years ago .

i mean , it does n't suit you . 
no . yeah ... i ... i do n't know . maybe i did . leo , this was before <person> <person> . i was in college . it was a bunch of kids , and i was just <number> of 'em . i did n't believe in what they were saying . <person> , i did n't even know what they were saying ! 
this was n't what i had in mind , <person> . 
you talked to him ? 
you might be the only one with a job . 
love 'em , helmuth . i give up . what are you holding in your hand ? 
... well , maybe it works on fingers , too . 
no , that 's still in my jacket i was wearing . we were supposed to meet on the docks , that number <number> wharf , <number> o'clock friday . he 's gon na hand me <number> bucks .

i know what 'strapped ' means , motherfucker . what the fuck you think this shit is ? '21 <person> <person> ? ' cool out , they 're coming back . just throw up your screw face and do n't speak unless spoken to . 
walt ! 
yah . 
yeah , if i can . 
well , the marijuana crop is a good start . 
mmmmmmm ! mmmmmmm ! 
must be your lucky day then . i â€™ ve got your accounts - you don â€™ t owe much tax for last year . 
actually , someone did . i just did n't think i could eat anything . 
where ? 
i 've come to dinnnnnner ! 
where are you from , captain ? 
even better . 
elaine , i do n't want to have to take you in for questioning . you 've got his car , you were the last to see him â€“ 
all right , let 's have a rematch . 
so if i asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written ... <person> ? you know a lot about him i bet . <person> 's work , criticisms , political aspirations . but you could n't tell me what it smells like in the sistine chapel . you 've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling . and if i asked you about women i 'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites , and maybe you 've been laid a few times too . but you could n't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy . if i asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material , but you 've never been in <number> . you 've never held your best friend 's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath , looking to you for help . and if i asked you about love i 'd get a sonnet , but you 've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable . known that someone could kill you with a look . that someone could rescue you from grief . that <person> had put an angel on <person> just for you . and you would n't know how it felt to be her angel . to have the love be there for her forever . through anything , through cancer . you would n't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for <number> months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term `` visiting hours '' did n't apply to you . and you would n't know about real loss , because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself , and you 've never dared to love anything that much . i look at you and i do n't see an intelligent confident man , i do n't see a peer , and i do n't see my equal . i see a boy . nobody could possibly understand you , right <person> ? yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw . you must know everything about me . you 're an orphan , right ? 
could we make it to the mountains ? 
i 'll get your bag . 
hm . well , i like you , too . i like your aunt . i like your shoelaces . i like -- 
after careful consideration , dr. grant - - so have i . 
his eyes are open . 
i just want to have something that 's mine , you know ? it 's like living off of their money is fun and all . there are certain materialistic needs that i have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch . 
look , we 're not suckers . everyone else is out there doing the same thing . 
irwin ... 
... there are notations every thirty seconds ... 
my fault ? ... oh , <person> -- all i want is to be proud of him . he can be such a fine boy , if we show him how to be . 
i have my own little island . 
that 's an interesting piece of news . 
perfectomundo ! we are ready ! say , would n't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? think of all the time <number> would save . 
you never saw your mom and me kiss like that ? 
does your mother know ? 
no police ! wait until i 'm gone . 
no . and i have been sick . i spent a week in a hospital when i was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning . <number> skinny <number> year old kids were playing around the pool . they were dunking me . i swallowed water . they did n't know it and they almost killed me . heroes do n't get killed like that . normal people do . 
we had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it . 
i say hang the bastard out to dry , let her see him for the heel he is , then maybe she 'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain . 
that old standing offer from <person> <person> -- poet of washington correspondents . 
... to take any extreme measures i deem necessary ... 
he got onto the pool deck with a gun . how did he get past her security carrying a

well if you wo n't work for me , will you work for the president ?

yeah , i guess . maybe not . you do n't think a psychiatrist- ? 
how did the rabbits kill him ? 
he 's an asshole . 
and you 've got that , have you ? 
yes , is n't he . 
what are you doing here ? 
she knows how to take care of herself . 
do n't worry , chief . i 'm not gon na let anything happen to her ... no matter what . 
<person> <person> , you 're the artist , i 'm just the ten percenter . you decide what you want and i 'll make it happen . i 'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism â€“ if i can use that word and hollywood in the same breath . 
i should have never listened to calvin . 
and what would be of greater help , than to release her , from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence . do n't you think ? in which the innocent are tortured in ways which would make the anguish of the damned seem tame and unimaginative , do n't you < u > think < /u > ? blind him again , and prepare < u > him and her < /u > for the pigs ! 
come on , they were a little old for a slumber party . 
i ca n't ! 
do me a favor , will you ? spare me , for <person> 's sake . get in the real world . what do you think ? i 'm going to resign in protest ? to force it on the air ? the answer is `` no . '' i do n't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of national public radio . that decision i 've already made .

i do n't like to be tailed . the lady i 'm with does n't like to be stared at . to put the matter in a couple of nutshells , i do n't like you .

he 'd just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .

parts of it . 
i have heard that <person> <person> got down on his knees in the grand ticino and proposed to her . 
and what , sergeant ? 
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded `` heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .

my last lesson 's next week . <person> ... my car ... 
i have to help him !

hawaii . i 've read all about it . i 've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet . oh , god . i 'd kill to go there . 
the girl 's dead , driscoll . there 's no point continuing on . 
is that what you were trained to do ? 
nobody move ! 
well , if you 're sure it would n't -- no use combing my hair for nothing . 
he 'd have more power as a martyr . no , to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most . meaning , us . 
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires <number> ounces of rum . 
like it would make a difference if you were , right ? this guy 's a friend and now he 's takin ' ya out . 
it does n't have to be like that . we do n't have to be enemies . 
of course . you did n't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you 'd slapped my face . 
i thought `` <person> <person> has a really nice voice . '' you did n't even know i was there . 
you keep out of this -- you admit you thought of killing him -- how were you going to do it ? 
with all due respect , <person> , i think you might 've wandered a little past your pay-grade . 
no . 
he 's got his own band in moscow . it 's called `` <person> <person> <person> <person> jeans '' or something like that . 
the clip 's not gon na hold !

eileen , chinese food again ? 
i 'm not sure if i can deliver what you want . 
all right . but this better be good . 
you did , sir . gillis ' voice he goes out . gillis i pegged him as slightly looks after him , hangs cuckoo , too . a stroke maybe . his coat over a chair , come to think of it , the walks over to the win- whole place seemed to have dow , pulls down the been stricken with a kind of rickety venetian blind . creeping paralysis , out of as he does so , he looks beat with the rest of the down at : world , crumbling apart in slow motion ... 
oddly enough , i do . 
if there were a man like that , with a kink in his brain around here loose , what would he be like . 
how much money you got ? 
yeah . <person> wants to talk to you ! 
marcee -- this is <number> of our agents . this is <person> <person> , who needs to learn to knock .

yeah , but it does n't take <person> <person> just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not . 
<number> hundred cops ? was <person> <person> there ? he owes me money . 
cause i do n't take <person> <person> <person> . i do n't know what you 're up to , lady , but i 'm gon na nail you for the acme murder . 
goddamnit , nigger - you must think you 're white ! who d'you think you are - king of harlem ? 
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape ? 
all right . i 'll give you a few more clues . 
have you gotten laid once since you moved here ? did you fuck once ? 
where did you get this ? 
yeah . <person> <person> says it in -- 
i told you . it 's the down payment . and thanks to you it 's overdue . 
yeah ! sure . 
no , thank you . i 'll walk . 
oh , stop talking about yourself like you 're a lush or something . i do n't like it . maybe you ought to go to a clinic , get some treatments . 
it 's going to have to do for now , considering that it 's my car that 's up for request . can i help you ? 
but i want to put her name on the list for tomorrow . my daughter . 
why ? because i give a shit ? 
looks like you live in here , for <person> ! 
the good news , <person> , is you 're half- undressed for *swimmin'* ... 
not anymore . football team started practice last week . he 's already called me to hook up . 
if you have something to say , i suggest you say it to morpheus . 
you did n't answer my question . what are you doing ? 
<person> boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria . 
well then the people you need to call are the police . 
however , with injuries such as this , i have run into minor hemorrhaging , which really is n't too serious at the time , but can cause secondary problems if not looked after . 
you know <person> never comes to see me . you watch it , she 's going straight to hell ... after all the things she said to me . then she marries that son of a bitch of a frenchman ... has an abortion . i knew that <number> would n't work out . not like you <person> . you got married to god . 
get in there now or i 'll bury you in this river . 
yeah . so you want double condiments on that ? 
it 's me you want . not her . 
i 'm just trying to find out who you are . 
actually he said `` glad . '' _ <number> . 
look , i know you think this is irresponsible of me , but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person . 
that 's the grace of this world . nothing 's impossible . 
gambling 's about not facing reality . ignoring the odds . 
can you take me to it ? 
< u > what < /u > ? ... 
patient . 
i 'm on with a friend ! <person> , i 'd better go . i love you . 
for <person> 's birthday , yes . i did n't go because her old man thinks i 'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated ... they 'll be back tomorrow night . jud , what 's this about ? 
no , thank you . 
the brewers . 
i better go check on my father . thanks for the pizza . i owe you <number> . maybe when he gets better , you know , when we 're done with all this . 
we 've dumped the whole data-base from <number> of the cleaning remotes into the helmet . it 'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go . 
yep . 
my butt 's bothering me ! 
it 's too ... 
no . who ? 
yes ! yes ! 
if you 're such a devoted fan , why were you at the play tonight instead of the game ? answer carefully . this is important . you could have gone to the theater last night . there was no game last night . 
no . it 'd be useless . <person> 'd get the wire before they would . 
that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct . 
yes . <person> . if you 'll excuse me . 
well , i did n't vote for you . 
why ? we 're only talking . 
well , there 's your trouble right there -- you 're too old for me . 
it 's possible . 
we 'll worry about that later . <person> , i 'll take damage reports . 
we wo n't be here . 
she 's a constant surprise . 
yes , thank you . 
you still have that watch <person> gave you ? 
his secretary . <person> <person> . 
well , it is kind of a long shot ... 
i can play as soldiers do , but have no great skill . 
now do n't kid a kidder . 
oh , is that what caused it ? 
okay , <person> <person> , let 's have the mail box . 
you 're jet-lagged . we 'll talk about this back ... 
why it 's perfectly plain , your the teacher at the college , you do n't want the building torn down . 
police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there . 
the federal bureau of investigation is not based on personal preference . we share information . 
well , you are n't the president , dear . 
<number> reason ... i want to stay the only <number> left alive . 
it makes sense ; <person> worked for the c.i.a . and the white house was paranoid about <person> <person> . 
i can answer for this , it was self- defense -- i can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters , you know them ? 
it was n't meant to be . 
oh , i studied the guitar . i had to give it up . gave me calluses on my fingers . as an actress i ca n't afford to have a tarnished instrument . 
we 're here to find <person> <person> . he may be injured or dead . 
you want to go ? 
whose side are you on anyway ? 
it 's the screws , <person> . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they 're pulling the <person> < u > and < /u > cyclops right to the bottom . 
well . the only thing i 've been certain of , all this time , is that i need to get to the ocean . the point is no one seems to know how to get there . 
what did you see ? 
i know how it is to be lonely . is there anything you wish to tell me ? 
that 's the problem . he did . 
i 'll call them , okay ? 
i am called <person> ... ... now you are <person> . 
that 's <person> . the deal 's closing . i can pick that phone up and i can work this out . you 'll walk with me . 
good night , <person> . 
i had a career . she wanted a little bowler of her own . <person> and <person> leap into the fray , prying the <number> men apart . they wrestle theo against a wall , pressing his face into the tiles . 
what 's your favorite scary movie ? 
do n't you like her ? 
so you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job , and the next saxophone player , and it 's the same thing all over again . see what i mean ? - not very bright . 
dr. gruber 's not in . 
go to <person> 's <person> <person> in spitalfields . take her to the metro for a margarita . do n't have to tell her who you are . just tell her jody was thinking -- 
it looks new , they might miss <number> or <number> . 
oh , shit ! 
good night . 
why do you think i was hiding ? 
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition . 
i hope they do . 
why ? 
and where is he now ? you believe what you want , but i 'm telling you the truth -- i never would have brought you here if i thought it was dangerous . 
i do n't know , he just said he wants to wait . i quit asking . 
in the yellow room , where the music 's playing and the ladies are ? 
or angry little mountain streams -- and cattle moving against the sun . you have n't seen any of that , have you , <person> ? 
where 's the ether ? this mescaline is n't working . 
uh-huh . 
let me rephrase that ... 
it seems the men could n't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs . israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission , often endangering their own lives . they do n't use women anymore . 
that 's him . 
i got to admit it 's not what i thought it 'd be . back when <person> had it -- hell , i 'm just a jailer . run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows . 
i 'm fine . 
yes ma'am ? 
you think you can find your boat ? there 's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here . you remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now ? you leave yourself a trail ? 
okay . 
and i 'm afraid we want it back . 
<person> 's marrying <person> . 
oh man ! they could n't pick me ! they had to pick you ! 
the other <person> got to him . 
what do you mean , different ? 
come on , <person> . 
let 's see what we got ... 
what did these people do when her heart stopped ? 
that 's my cousin , angelo . 
let me tell you something , son . you would have been great at anything . 
look at the statues , they 're thin . 
i 'm staying . 
tell you ... 
oh , did i ? i 'm sorry . . . 
we 've only seen and talked to <number> suspect . he calls himself `` <person> '' . there 's <number> jewelers , <number> salespeople , the manager , a security guard , and an elderly woman . this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair . they have anywhere from <number> to <number> <number> in raw stones on any given day , so they sure as shit did n't just wander in . they knew what they were coming for . 
<person> said we deliver the first ladies in needles . then we go home . no questions asked . 
sir -- 
oh ? well , there 's been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it 's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help ... 
nobody 's saying cancel . i 'm talking about modifying . 
he 's going home . he slept over because i was a little anxious ... 
i just needed a wash and set , a wash and set , that 's all . 
excellent . here they come . 
that old pirate <person> <person> <person> personally took this to taiwan when he was run out of china in <number> . peking would dearly love to have this back ... 
can she i.d . them ? 
you 'll be the eternal tropo ... the old man and the sea ... know the words to this <number> ? <number> , the shark has pretty teeth , dear , and he shows them pearly white ... ' 
well ... ? 
no , i think maybe you 've been right . i think i may have been too critical in the past . 
how do you feel , champ ? 
do n't do it ! do n't do it ! 
a theatre poet ? 
you would n't come to find me ? that makes me never want to come here . but she continues unraveling the turban . 
i would n't touch you to scratch you . 
somebody named <person> <person> . 
manchester -- yes . yes , yes , they do . yes -- now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning ? -- have we cigars -- water and everything ? 
my father is watching the businessman . the businessman had a partner who disappeared . left his whole business and family , his wife and <number> kids . they think he 's been murdered . 
oh . well , i 'd love to hear some . 

oh , it 's nothing . 
how can you be so sure ? 
<person> galahad ! ! 
`` we '' being the behavioral science unit , at quantico . you 're <number> of <person> <person> 's , i expect . 
but i found you . all the clues led me here ... 
shut the door ! 
what do you want from me ? would i swim across an ocean for you ? ... would i walk across the united states for you ? yes ... yes i would . you know that . 
you 're all fuckers . vicious little fuckers . 
it 's all right . 
<number> of those ... big beds ? 
but i ate your mom 's pie . 
this stays between you and i . we finally have an edge . i do n't want to lose it . 
because -- i want you to be happy . 
at least i 'm open to new concepts ! 
how sweet . is that when you put the move on her ? 
no , i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ? 
yes , quite all right . thank you , sir . 
sounds good , where are you now ? 
i remember you . 
stop it .

this is embarrassing . 
i do n't have the slightest idea . 
yes i did .

these are my people ... unnt-meah ! go ! go ! < u > please < /u > ! 
father ... father ! 
there , <person> <person> . all open and above-board and in due and legal form . 
a.m -- or p.m. ? 
you should really let a doctor look at that . 
going to turley , was it ? 
yes . 
helen and i went out for breakfast . excom 's not supposed to convene til <number> . 
bingo . 
the what ? 
ed , it 's over . i need a normal life . 
do n't worry , i 'll teach you .

of course ! you want out ? 
no , not <person> . he 's dead . the man that killed him -- also prob'ly <person> <person> , also <person> <person> . 
no ... like a psychiatrist . 
why ? 
do n't you want to see what <person> does for a living ? 
no time . get him up . 
i was ahead of my time . 
never say ca n't . just do what i do . 
will you shut up for a minute ! ! pull your car out of line .

what an old , old man you 're getting to be , francis . were n't you ever a yellow ? i bet you were even wilder than -- come on , <person> . 
<person> , <person> . <person> , you 're still building onto that <person> <person> , that illusion . and now you 're adding onto it by what you 're doing here . that 's the illusion . 
and bringing the enterprise here ? ! what possible purpose could that serve ? 
never , what ? ! 
how clumsy . i 'd never forgive myself . good night my dear . 
hey , i though you guys were coming to the show , man ?

a nix specialty ? 
all right , then . 
in europe . 
you got ta good heart . 
you wan na bet ? 
do you suppose it has anything to do with <person> 's unusually hairy body ? 
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for <person> 's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life ... no thanks . 
wow . you do n't fool around , do you ? 
well , we have plenty of those . right over here . we got the mgm series , <person> and rogers , the judy garlands ... 
he 's full of shit . 
when do you think they 'll come ? 
but you know he did it . 
my father 's guilty . he lied to me , he lied to everybody . i just left home ... i need you . 
and i do n't see you sunbathing at chernobyl ! 
i know the words ... fucking psycho fucking bullshit , that 's the words . 
no , we 'd never ... .oh , <person> , honey , you shoulda told me sooner . 
yeah . 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye , the face , the ear . 
guns . can you get them ? 
<person> <person> ! there 's a fellow with personality .

if we could take a look , <person> <person> ... 
god , you 're just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark , so i ca n't experience anything for myself 
listen , we get a deluge like this , just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough . so never mind the side issues . 
not all of us , <number> . 
perhaps not . perhaps we can all use ... a little spandex . 
you have it with you ? 
yes ! 
hi , i was in the neighborhood and thought i 'd see -- 
i 'm leavin ' the place to <person> . 
your apartment . 
just a coincidence ? 
another time . 
<person> sheldon ? you mean <person> <person> the writer ? 
who do ? 
tomorrow ... 
you 're marvelous , ma . you 're just like <person> used to be . do you realize a couple of weeks ago we did n't have enough to eat ourselves ? 
you think <person> found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse . 
easy , easy -- 
just a few miles . i 'd a walked her if my dogs was n't pooped out . 
-- <person> <person> . 
we tried to be . we tried to be . 
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy . 
all right , damn it . we 've seen you with your clothes off around here , stand up and pull up your dress and let 's take a look ! 
i had to be a damn hemingway hero . well i 'll tell ya , the old man and the sea did n't go through half this shit . 
vernon , florida . 
oh , <person> . <person> , you do n't know what 's going on . let her go . i 'll explain it later . 
i 'll never let go ! 
we 'll be at the fallbrooks . the number 's next to the phone . 
i ca n't help it . even with the business we 're in , i -- it gets me every time . it 's so -- optimistic . 
the story goes like this : he proposed , and i told him i had to think about it , and he insisted i wear the ring anyway . then my mother told the paper we were engaged . 
we wandered into a fucking time capsule ! 
okay . 
bond ! 
i could n't let you wear black on sailing day , sweetpea . it 's bad luck . 
what about tonight ? ... whatiya gon na do about <person> <person> tonight ? 
what 's that ? 
argentina ! <person> , you 're outta your mind . now you just tell me where you are and i 'll come for you . i wo n't say nothin ' to the police about <person> , i promise . he can do what he wants , i do n't care . 
<person> <person> ? <person> <person> ? <person> <person> runs this place ? that 's a laugh ! 
get me down from here you louts or i 'll turn you all into pigs ! 
what 's your father do ? 
<person> will have to show me where it happened . and of course , i 'll need the donkey . with any luck , i 'll sort it out tonight . 
an oldsmobile silhouette . 
you know how beautiful she was ? her husband left her , and he took her kids ... they , they , they 'd let you die in there . they do n't care . nobody cares . the patriot home , the chronic care ... in arlington ... ? they 'd take her in . <person> care . they 'd take her . fifty <number> dollars they want . an endowment . 
are n't you even curious ? about why she did it ? 
ever see hurling ? 
we can do it together . 
you think it 's healthy to obsessively collect things ? you ca n't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff ... i 'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers . 
what 's that ? 
not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it 's difficult to know . <person> thinkin ' , <person> ? 
no . 
keep it dry . no swimming . 
oh , <person> . 
deploy the collector . 
looks , huh ? 
humor ... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical ... 
<person> <person> â€“ he 's a lieutenant . 
... i ca n't make it tonight . 
you were very nervous . 
it 's the influence of all those family films . <person> , <person> ? hey , <person> ? ? ... 
<person> ravell . 
<number> , twenty-fire pounds . i 've been swimming at the y . 
yes . could you give me some information ? 
how are your grades ? 
yeah , what if i am ? what about it ? 
secret passageways do n't mean as much as they used to . there 's a place <number> blocks east of here . <person> 's . say <number> . 
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ? 
of course not . i was married to your father . 
i do n't want to scare them away . 
forty <number> dollars . 
i figured i 'd ask you ... 
we are not talking jokey understatement here , <person> . we 're talking actionable harassment . <number> phone calls a night , hanging around outside my house ... 
we do n't know that . 
<person> , i can take everything you got with that deck . it is marked . now i 'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere . 
shit ... 
not entirely . 
who do you think you are , ford ? the tooth fairy . <person> ! <person> ! <person> ! 
that `` walt '' guy got hit underwater -- 
<person> amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed ? 
well , long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject . after awhile , you begin to make friends with it , so to speak . 
i was afraid to ask . 
<person> 's scenario is unacceptable . and he has more experience than anyone . 
i 'll go . i 'll go . 
stop swinging the bat . 
what the fuck for ? 
gim me . 
what am i a headshrinker ? maybe the man was unhappy . 
promise ? 
once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure . 
expensive dresses . a heart necklace . 
i hope so . 
you hoto ? 
thanks for the consultation ... . 
this is clearly an important species we 're dealing with here . we ca n't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- 
mostly love , and romance . 
i think the building 's okay . at least for the time being . 
b58/732 , that 's a. buttle is n't it ? 
i told you . you have to be optimistic . believe in them ... 
thanks for calling . 
sing it in pictures , <person> . 
was i at that dinner ? 
would you mind showing it to me ? 
it 's not ? 
you were the one who was always suspicious of her ! 
it 's all right . 
i read this book , book on spiritualism ... 
let 's go . 
are you <person> <person> ? 
listen to you ! you sound like <person> , all pissed off because <person> is taking <person> . 
i 'd love to hear them . maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening , after work -- 
hell , it wo n't be us ! 
what about <person> ? 
you got in late last night . 
is <person> around ? 
i understand . 
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away , on the slim chance it 's ever needed in a courtroom . it 's like collecting diamonds on a desert island . you keep them just in case you ever get rescued , but it 's a pretty big ocean out there . 
yes , it 's lame . 
same business , guerrillas hauling <number> guys from the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment ... 
this was your garden ? 
it 's kind of a sports bar 
wherever they 're going , i 'm going . 
who 's your daddy ! 
call her . 
alright . you want me to get your old job back ? because i could , you know , i could put in that word . 
i guess not . 
she has the gift -- the blood of thorn running through her veins . <person> 's mother had it , too . so for <number> years i incubated her , prepared her for this night . <person> has served his purpose . and soon we will have a new progeny . 
did you ! imagine that ! how long will you be staying ? 
just admit it , <person> . 
what ? 
do n't you want me to stay ? 
it can always get worse . you ca n't change what 's out there , only where you 're coming from . you got to let the lord take over , in here . 
i really think you 're - 
and i you . 
i 'm afraid he 's slippin ' a bit with every hour that goes by ... 
what use am i ? 
is this a coup ? <person> , are you trying to tell me that i might be assassinated if i do n't agree ? 
there 's <number> things i ca n't stand , <person> <person> . being ignored , and being lied to . you did both . 
soft ! i will go along ; an if you leave me so , you do me wrong . 
i do n't know about his wanting to meet celebrities , that 's something new . but , yeah , he comes to l.a. then after that , i do n't know what happens . 
we 're not actually talking about it . 
who is it ? 
yes . 
<person> . if i did , i did n't mean to . 
now listen , <person> ... i sold <person> <person> the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne . `` the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia '' ! 
you told me you 'd take me over to seattle today . 
then someone forged a data bank entry . 
what ... ? 
what about <person> ? 
old friend . have n't talked to him in -- <number> . can i use your phone ? 
it 's a city ? 
well maybe there 's a way out of here . 
he was wearing a suit . 
you 're not getting any navy contracts . 
i 'm sorry , are you saying that if this thing goes to trial , it 'll be < u > <number> years < /u > before these plaintiffs see their money ? 
uh ... no . you just ... look different than you sounded on the phone . <person> , come in . 
you 've had a lot of fun with me today . what would you have done if i had n't responded to your call ? 
i 'm not waiting until it 's too late . 
she < u > likes < /u > me . she said for me to call ! 
braces ? 
let me think about that . 
so i can get my job back . 
how could it be irresponsible , <person> , if you were the first man in the world to do it ? 
yeah ? 
it 's got a nice ring to it . it sounds like a movie . `` clarence and <person> <person> to cancoon '' . do n't 'cha think ? 
i ... 
well , i 'm here now . i 'd like to do something ... 
no -- i 'm cleaning an attic . i would n't attempt the impossible . 
that 's a long time . 
you what ? 
what ? 
she 's on to him . you shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is , he kin run her crazy . 
it 's just this get-up . the girl 's out and i was bringing <person> 's supper . 
not that i 've seen -- but that has no meaning -- that means nothing . 
why is she leaving me ? 
jackie ? 
i do n't buy that . there 's a place for hatred . did you know that <person> and i got into an argument the night she was killed ? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her . do you know what that feels like ? 
trigger . 
oh no . mostly research in endocrinology . 
oh sure . it 's very rewarding ... 
how long she been dead ? 
i told you about calling me boy . i ai n't no boy . see , you and <person> got a bad habit of calling me boy . you call me boy in front of my wife . you think i 'm going to fix the roof ? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain . 
smarter than americans . you 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long . not only will americans believe me , they 'll cry for me . so ... detective eddie flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your <person> ? maybe you can propose to her now ? 
no i 'm not sweetie . 
because . 
i 'm delighted the critics are liking it , and i hope the people like it , too . but it 's not why i wrote the book . 
thanks . 
you get lost ! 
elvis i like , too . 
well , that 's why you got it . 
i 'll help you tote 'em if i do n't give out first . 
we sure do . i do n't mean it as a knock either . go ahead . i 'll just say what i think and you can disregard it if you want . 
a couple of guys , i owe them . so , that 's what i did . i gave 'em the money . that 's what i did . 
he is dead . you would be also , if your wound had not somehow shut . 
do n't you get smart with me , boy . 
oh my god ! you 're at southglen south ? they have a killer baseball team .

you what , <person> <person> <person> ? you what ? 
i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ? i was walking toward somebody who did n't have any idea who i really was . and it was only half the other person 's fault , because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted . so it was good that i did n't go through with it because it would have been a lie , but you -- you knew the real me .

but -- if he *does* , <person> -- 
what ? 
now see ? do n't do that . i 'll go along with all you say about me . but that ... you ca n't pretend no more on that . cuz i was just a kid , <person> . i did n't know about any of that stuff he was doin ' to me . and you let him do it . some big nobody in your life ... and you let him do as he wanted ... with the only somebody you had .

and what is that ? 
mmm . <person> closer . 

i ca n't do it , <person> . it is n't ethical . i could lose my license . 
i am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate . i am <person> <person> head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me . i own this school and everything that 's in it . you 're in it ! but why ? what did a roman general do to get himself condemned to the colosseum ? understand , we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets . <person> , i separated you from the others because ... ... my nose tells me you 've been condemned for important reasons . 
almost <number> . 
for a new kenworth . that 's a truck .

<number> minutes ? 
dr. malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology . 
wait . < i > have < /i > you helped him , <person> ? at this point , technically , i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive . so you still have a choice . you can help him and risk going down again , get cuffed and shackled , hope to god you pull a reasonable judge , not some hard-on . or , if you want to play it another way ... 
like what ? corporate responsibility ? what , are we talking celebrity here ? 
they 've got her ! 
you come highly recommended , <person> . and your particular assignment requires a special talent .

how do you kill it ? 
how do you know that , <person> ? did we try ? are we just giving up like the rest of 'em ? what 's <person> found , for <person> 's sake ? 
-- these preposterous inventions , would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine . if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind , perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter ! but i doubt it . i most seriously doubt it . as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales , a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years . yours sincerely , et cetera . 
i know . 
all of these are interviews ? 
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you ? 
do n't tell meâ€” do n't tell me ! 
a hunch . things he said . like , knowing how to recognize a phony id -- 
how do you know i am playing ? well , the clown is always harmless . is n't that right ? and how did you ever get to know me so well ? the last we spent any time together i was fourteen . i think you know me better than my father . he 's going to die , is n't he ?

oh , i 'm fine . 
i 'm gon na grab you . i did n't mean it to be a question . i 'm gon na grab you . 
well , if she 's gon na write fiction , there 's nothing like being a reporter .

you got about <number> more big states to go before we find out . 
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government , so you make more money . then once you make the transition , you realize you were never working for the government ; it was always the private sector , the vested interests and it 's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets . 
you 'll be at home for the weekends . now shut up , or walk . 
i realize your anger , <person> , but we must learn to forgive . it 's hard , but revenge will never bring about peace . 
ye-es ? 
i 'm afraid of being lonely . 
i can see her face so clearly . <person> <person> . my heart was flying out of my chest with love . 
a visitor .

i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago . 
you know , when <person> and i got married , i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early . people talk about spending their lives together , how many of them really get to ? but maybe i was wrong . maybe sooner or later everything wears out .

shut up <person> , please ... just shut up ! 
no . 
do n't just stand there gapin ' <person> . ca n't you see he 's cold ? 
catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy . when we started , there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as `` receivers . '' all they did was observe and report . nothing more . but <person> , she had the ability to feel what was happening . she understood . and the patient responded . <person> engaged her in dialogue , took her places , showed her things . he knew she cared . 
frank . <person> . 
well , that 's not gon na happen . 
please , <person> . trust us . 
what he 's trying to say is : every team needs a mascot ... 
we have no choice . 
okay . good night . 
i can see that . 
i 'm not at liberty to say . 
yes . why did you kill <person> <person> ? 
that 's it , <person> , pretend it 's <number> of those arcade things , the tighter you squeeze , the more of a man you are ... ooh , that 's it . 
eating <person> , just like the last time you asked . 
i 'm nothing like him . 
do you know who you address , sir ? 
i do n't know ... 
you really went and did it . with <number> day , not even a day , of planning , you did it . nobody does it better , <person> . you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex . 
what the fuck are we doing out here ? somebody call the police ! we need help ! 
we 're not going out tonight . 
you ca n't let <person> do that . 
<person> â€™ t you ? then why the worried messages on his answering machine , rhian ? i â€™ d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble . 
every tom , <person> , and <person> thinks he can write . but a journalist gets in there , right where the bombs are . he 's aggressive . grabs the bull by the balls . 
timmy , listen to dr. grant ! 
hold on a minute . where you going ? 
how can you possibly oversleep ? 
i 'm <number> of his people . the cubans are his people . and we 're going to jail for him .

perhaps you did not have the < u > support < /u > you required . 
i know , but listen -- 
... that 's all well and good , captain , save for <number> thing : there 's no gold down there . 
yup . 
it would n't happen to be this ... 
i thought you were allergic to latex . 
i do n't want your dead body . i do n't want you back in jail either .

i 'm sorry .. i do n't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone 's looking at me .. 
like if you shoot yourself in the foot ? would n't matter . you 'd be dead before you realized you 'd accidentally pulled the trigger . 
deeds , not words . i need your help . 
no . <person> . <person> . my family 's in tuxedo , new york , though . 
pardon me ? 
okay , no monkey business then . 
all i â€™ m saying it there isn â€™ t a guy in union county who wouldn â€™ t give his left nut to be married to kate ...

because i kept a copy . i have it right here . 
his name would n't be <person> , would it ? 
no , she â€™ s not . 
<number> ...

i do n't know . 
funny , that . 
i 'm <person> <person> . ms. <person> 's attorney . 
you did n't want my opinion in the first place , so why even ask ?

what ? 
no race should be a slave to another . 
panty hose . <person> better'n stockin 's . <person> <number> of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head . you get the pistol . remember , soon as we get inside , you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it . once they notice the ithaca and the smith , they 'll know we ai n't foolin ' with 'em . 
<person> ? 
-- yeah , that was in the times this morning . 
around . 
yeah ... guess so . 
pussy , ass , soft personnel . 
almost <number> years .

yeah ... it could be fun . 
i do n't know . i 've seen them so many times before . i guess any spot gets boring after awhile . 
yes ... <person> 's <person> ? 
i completely agree . 
who ? 
hell no ! 
oh <person> . . . when i sent the remains of my last experiment . . . 
i decided to make a female figure after all ! i want you to pose for it . 
do i recognize him ? i recognize what he is . i like him . he 's canadian . he can read italian . he can catch rabbits . 
words , words , words ! <person> has been tutoring <person> in the philosophies , is n't that right ? 
well that hardly sounds like you ... 
yes . 
i do n't want that to happen . why would i want that to happen ? 
september the ninth ? 
yes , sir . 
do n't apologize , <person> . 
i think we 'd better shut off all access till we can find that file . just to be safe . 
no . a poor little rich boy who thought he â€™ d save a few kids from their retailer . he disappeared on his second shopping expedition . 
what ? 
i wan na be with you today . 
i finished it . 
with or without the rest of the fleet ? 
what , <person> ? what did i do ? what 's made you so sad ? 
it 's not fast enough , norman . there 's a helluva lot of explosive down there . 
we , have already taken care of them . 
jake ... 
grand champion , is it ? and what great cause leads you to me ? 
i heared it cryin ' a little through that box . 
mrs. jacobi after her changing . the dragon rampant . do you see ? 
i do n't know . i 'm not exactly the nine-to-five type . 
bobbie , what are you talking about ? 
shit . <person> , shit , shit ! 
it 's an old psychological strategy , <person> <person> . to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy . 
my doctors did n't want a settlement at any price . they wanted this cleared up in court . they want their vindication . i agree with them . but for today the offer stands . before we begin the publicity of a trial . for today only . when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn . as long as you understand that . it 's got to be that way . 
you heard his , <person> . find a new spot . and remember , we 're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks . 
vulcans sleep lying down ... 
i 'd love to . 
there 's something i need to talk about with you . 
that 's what he wants . 
we should talk alone . 
no . 
look , maybe i should just ... 
have you got leave to go to confession to-day ? 
he 's waiting for you . 
she knows everything ? does she know she came once before and you put her in -- 
maybe i 'm not going to keep you here . maybe i 'm gon na blow your brains out . 
cherry-red tears . 
who ! who 's running ? ! ! who have we been chasing ! ? ? can i ask this question now ! ! ! 
i am braver . 
no ? 
i did n't ? 
then why do n't we just get it out of the way . 
beam the vulcan up -- and we talk . 
i just want to see how much bullets it takes . 
who are they , sir ? 
hers'n zodda meg a livig . 
i 'm not a stalker . 
hmm , as in -- that 's interesting . sometimes , with enough clues , it 's possible to figure these things out . 
put yo'self in my shoes . say you out here , alone , with a beaten , half naked , white woman loves to fuck . i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby . 
no , sir ! 
they 've cut communication , and i spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives . my only solution ran out of batteries . 
you mean the falsely accused ? 
thanks , <person> . 
no one 's ever done it before . this 'll put us on the map . 
i know ! 
no you wo n't . 
when ? 
god i admire you . 
carrying <person> 's notebook ? 
specifically . 
well i do n't want to come on too strong . a guy hates a girl to come on strong . fragile egos and all of that . 
maybe you wo n't feel that way after i tell you what i stopped in for . 
i do n't take my orders from you ; not anymore . 
... where ? 
oh no ? how about this <number> ? 
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything . 
oh , shit , that 's not right . 
there is no -- 
got to catch me first -- 
dead . 
then buy a bottle and go outside . 
i guess the news you â€™ d sent me after <person> didn â€™ t go down too well , eh ? 
are you okay ? 
toi . they 've been 'going out ' for <number> weeks . 
are you kidding ? 
let me go in back . you look like you need all the room you can manage . 
some money . 
it 's a goddman trial balloon . <person> is the operative word , here . 
but that smile . 
you and candy ... ? 
preacher , take your tin <person> and the virgin mary , both , and shove 'em . 
who is this ? 
i 've done no television whatsoever . no . 
at some point a man 's got to get serious about his future . i 'm sure you have no idea what i 'm talking about . 
i was with <person> , she filled me in . 
not this week . 
no -- but i can get it for you . 
instantaneous . 
you 're upset , that 's alright . 
you want those assholes , you want top dollar . 
you would have done the same for me . 
no thanks . 
yeah . 
you would n't happen to know what language they speak in india , do you ? 
good evening , <person> . 
she sounded strong ... 
what ? 
and the fireworks . hand me that box , <person> . 
that 's strange is n't it ? not remembering <number> fever ... or a cold ... or a sore throat . what do you think that means ? 
do you see teem ? 
to who ? <person> ? nothing . nothing that <person> does n't already know . 
look great , do n't i ? 
hey , this is a pretty nice place . 
and down here -- 
they become complicated ... messy . 
then why do i have to go to bed ? 
i got a call from him today . <person> . he dropped out of sight during the war , and i 'd heard he 'd gone east . i guess he 's back . it 's a mission number . 
only what 's on the menu ... a number <number> : plain omelette . it comes with cottage fries and rolls . 
you 're not funny <person> ; you 're fat and look as though you should be funny , but you 're not . 
at the airport ? cause we decided at the airport he hugs the fat , wet <person> <person> , we ... 
and then what ? after supper , music ? whispers ? 
no , i do n't get you ... 
i know it is , even if you do n't . 
i know <person> <person> is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too , did n't you ? 
i 'm taking my next book to viking . 
you go down to the bottom of the sea , where the water is n't even blue anymore , where the sky is only a memory ... and you float there , quietly , quietly and stay there ... and you decide that you will die for them ... only then do they start coming out . they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them ... if it 's sincere . if it 's pure ... they will be with you and take you away forever . 
i 'm in love with <person> . had n't you heard ? 
thanks , professor . 
get the fuck outta here already . 
well ! are n't we the daring <number> ? what 's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make <person> <person> set foot outside her door ? the antenna is gone off her car again . i had no music , all the way to the market . let me find a garage for it ? 
fourth measure , second beat - f. flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis , flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis . 
of course . yes . i will . i do . 
so where does that leave us , <person> <person> ? what kind of sad future are we <number> making ? a future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies ? a future where no price is too high for fame and power ? when we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard ? 
you want me to go around -- 
mm . 
is that because you were masquerading as <person> <person> while you were in lawson ? 
proof ? we 've got plenty of proof . 
all right , they 're makin ' a movie . 
not that i know of . explanation ? 
i think the moment that food hits your mouth we 'll get a job . 
`` hell ! '' 
uh-huh . 
i 'll be right back . 
... perhaps there is a way ... i have heard tales of another power . 
witch ? huh ! i 'm not afraid of a witch ! i 'm not afraid of anything -- - except a lighted match . 
well ... 
the piano . 
sometimes . 
but who will they turn to for help ? 
what 's he doing in my refrigerator . 
the inside man ? 
yes ? 
you know , i can remember once , getting back below the dmz -- and the first americans we ran into were a track squadron . i just could n't believe how much water they had . we 'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week , and before that , for <number> weeks , we 'd been drinking anything -- rain water , river shit , stuff right out of the paddies . and there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over . i could 've killed them . i swear to god i would have , too , if ... 
he . she . let 's blow the bitch up ! 
-- fuck <person> ! 
okay . 
<number> has nuthin ' to do with the other . 
i hoped the challenge would improve your performance . you could say it was a carrot . 
how did she smell ? did her puss stink ? 
well this is your business , <person> . if you -- 
what are we thinking ? 
what did you say ? 
then what is it ? is there somebody else ? 
only god knows the meaning of such words , my son . 
half a flounder . <person> ... a burlap bag ... a paint can ... aha ! 
you bringing your new friend ? 
<person> <number> and <number> seconds . 
let 'em come . i 'm ready . 
you 're not very ambitious , are you ? 
immigration officer ? 
it will do just fine . 
buddy , i have to ask you , as bad as i 've been please have pity on me and do n't ruin me by telling them what i did . i know it was bad , it was bad and dumb . but mostly it was dumb , i did n't mean you no harm , i 'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that 's the truth . i love you . but they 'd think i did , they 'd think i was awful , they 'd despise me and hate me ... 
yes . it will double our range . i know at least a dozen ways to get horses . all cheap . 
it 's still taking too long . the people used to snap to . 
look at the publisher . <person> for the recently deceased press . 
i swear . 
well , well ! 
sixtyâ€”forty . 
alright , how 'bout all your fuckin ' money ? 
that 's not why we broke up . 
<number> . no one knows you 're his father . i thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you . 
well , as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment , i 'll be sound as a pound . 
you and i should talk first . 
nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth . 
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that . 
cut it out now . i 'm warning you . 
wow . 
oh , no . 
you might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks . 
you 're a scumbag . 
oh no . he said that . 
do you have any particular reason to say that ? 
look , i do n't want your money ! 
you have n't paid the cab . he wo n't give us your bags 'til you pay him . 
oh , well that 's easy : i 'm hot . you 're ... well , you 're a little limp . <person> 's easy to see through . and <person> 's always been a hardass . why are n't you writing this down ? 
yes . 
that 's right . 
actually , i 'm a movie star out for a walk . 
are you a doctor ? 
theory , partner ... if it responds to external electrical impulse , it might respond to <number> coming from inside it ... confuse it ... drive it away ... . 
signs and wonders . but i think once you stop hearin ' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow . 
justin ? 
nah , too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the copley plaza . besides , if you 're a hitter , you 're either working for the russians or the italians . there 's no riding the fence . our little theory from last night just got blown to shit . something ... new is going on here . 
i ca n't believe my ears ... 
thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in verona . 
well , i would , you know , <person> . it 's just that ... well , i need more than that . i need twenty-five thousand . 
... i made a reservation at ... 
well -- well i 'm just back . and -- i must tell you -- something quite wonderful . 
traitor ! <person> <person> ! remember <person> <person> , right , sir ? 
different . 
no , in a lot of ways things are better now ... i dunno ... it 's complicated . everybody still hates each other , but they know how to hide it better , or something ... 
thanks . 
we were together <number> years , sir ! 
<person> ? 
no . no . it 's okay . i 'm okay . 
dr. <person> <person> . 
it will be fun meeting gregory every night at the station . 
maybe you 'd like a swim when we 're through . i never swim myself , so the pool tends to go to waste . 
at what point ? 
okay , you win . i 'm pissed off . i 'm seriously peeved . 
i do n't know . probably next friday . 
dinner at the white house . 
what about the other <number> ? 
is it gassed up ? 
you 're not death . you 're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants . 
i think i know . i think we can help . why do n't you start by telling me about your relationship . everything you can think of . everything about him . everything about you . and we 'll take it from there . 
for you . this is where you wanted to be . 
<person> told me it really tore her up when you did n't call this week . 
really ? please ? 
i 'm not afraid of the dark . 
i 'm going to wash up now . you all please excuse me . 
sir , you know what <person> is famous for ? cheese . the rest of the company is going to caen and we 're going to the goddamned cheese capital of france . there is no bright side . 
is that why you killed <person> <person> ? 
what a fine meal you 'd make , be the rest of you sweet as your tongue . 
wait a minute , <person> , i ca n't hear a thing . what ? 
and if there is , then <person> can kill someone ? 
i can appreciate that . 
you say that as though it 's some awful thing ! i never stopped loving wally ! 
well i 've kind of had my fill of the place , you know what i mean ? 
you . 
double down , baby . you got ta double down on an eleven . 
what do you mean ? 
yes . 
actually i 'm feeling up to leaving . 
<person> ! 
she looked good then . 
if what you say is true , it is a matter for the police ! 
how did they think that ? what are they ... crazy ? what do you mean . that 's bullshit , <person> . they 're giving you a fucken story . 
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car . 
and who bailed you out when a hit was put on you , you sorry sack of shit . who put you up ? who gave you a job ? 
last night i saw what has happened to you . the rick i knew in paris , i could tell him . he 'd understand . but the one who looked at me with such hatred ... well , i 'll be leaving <person> soon and we 'll never see each other again . we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris . if we leave it that way , maybe we 'll remember those days and not <person> , not last night . 
what about your personal safety in the meantime ? what about the army -- and the police ? 
what 's that ? 
right , all the bullets we can eat . 
yeah ? 
no . do you ? 
very realistic . 
in my pocket . 
well do some looking around the room . i see cups , ashtrays - let 's go ... 
but then when will we see each other ? 
just banged my head . it was an accident . 
do n't say that ! 
that 's too bad . 
yes , i know . 
watch your tongue , boy . 
i have to come back . if i do n't come back the people will think i 'm a coward . <person> , tomorrow he dies -- i want his blood on the sand . do you understand ? 
that 's not you having a whiskey sour with <person> <person> . 
fair enough . 
and you turned him down ? ? 
me ? 
i do . 
i 'm a volunteer , am n't i ? 
well , you know i 'm standin ' here and you say i look good ? 
probably . 
last year was awful rough -- mama passing on and the whole business with o.j. -- i mean it 's not like it was <person> <person> or <person> <person> or <number> of our own boys , but it really knocked me for a loop -- 
making a living . 
shut up . `` let 's get it on , '' <person> <person> , from <person> 's get it on . `` <person> , '' radiohead , from ok computer . 
it is an emergency , is n't it ? 
where do you want it ? 
oh shit ! 
i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand . 
that 's good . 
you do n't have to hunt to do it . 
huh ? oh , him , yeah . well i do n't see , um -- what exactly is the problem ? 
oh , yes ! you live near here , do n't you ? 
he does n't . i do n't know what he has , but i 'm hoping to god it 's not infectious ... 
say the words , `` i understand . '' 
are you in love with her ? 
i still think we should have met them first . 
did you do something to get us into trouble again ? 
<person> ? 
i guess he did n't appreciate your use of language . they do n't speak that way on television . it 's a rule . do you realize you 've cut off a valuable source of communication ? 
sounds like a bad idea to me , probally just get in the way . 
good . how are you ? 
what , are you trying to get rid of me ? 
why not ? 
oh , no . nothing 's wrong . everything 's fine ! so there 's gon na be a new order of things , huh ? everybody 's gon na cut himself a nice , fat slice of the <person> <person> , eh ? you forgot <number> detail , <person> <person> shotâ€”you forgot me , the prize stooge of the world . why , if you or anybody else thinks he 's gon na use the <person> <person> clubs for his own rotten purpose , he 's gon na have to do it over my dead body ! 
you mean the world series ? i thought the red sox were winning . 
thank you . 
<person> <person> , we know he is somewhere across the canal in the russian sector ... you may as well help us . in a few minutes colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers . tell me where <person> is . 
soon honey , soon . 
are n't you going to have <number> ? 
she 's not here . 
the trees are taller . 
... why on earth do the stones interest you ? 
that 's better than being the oldest has-been in hollywood history . 
do you wan na go to the van ? 
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and <person> i 'd be dead . 
i < u > know < /u > it 's his doctor ... i need the file on.. <person> <person> <person> m.d . 
but there 's still only <number> of us . 
<number> days ? i must be .

awright ! i want a nice clean dispersal this time . 
what happened to <person> <person> ? 
of course . 
i 'm sorry .

let 's hear it . 
well , if the guy is far , in a car , and i know weather is going to be bad , rain for example , i think i would plastic the car , with a remote here . i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic . 
you know , i got ta tell you . that really bothers me , somebody calls me `` son . '' 
not so fast , <person> . starting now , there 's gon na be an across the board cost a living increase . 
hoagie .

all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts . 
i order you not to ! 
a coffee and a couple of croissants . 
get all the big bills in the place . take them out and get them changed . get nothing but ones and fives . distribute them among the tellers . tell them to take their time . stall as much as possible . <person> and recount the money . 
come on then . 
we rented a car . 
i have to pick something up before <person> 's closes , then stop at a reception just a few blocks away . 
no three-way stretch ? how very un- chic . 
barton , honestly , only the last couple- 
yes , but i do n't want to leave . i think this guy 's following me . 
where are you going ?

look , <person> , maybe we can talk about this some other -- 
can you tell me what their names were ? 
because he believed me . 
... i want to say a thing . 
honeymoon temporarily canceled . the boy should still go out and exercise . i have the impression he never gets any exercise . he simply bloats himself with <person> <person> and bakes his brains over steam radiators . 
i got , like , uh ... . 
he knows you , man . he knows all you want is to move up . that 's all . a smooth hitter woulda gone in there , seen it was a wash and slipped out . but a guy like you ? <person> ' this is your only chance ? <person> ' eighteen years ?

never mind about that ... 
there 's an old fudgesicle over there . you want it ? 
i do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job ! dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket ... a picture of that cunt right next to the ... 
<person> <person> , <person> <person> , the < u > director < /u > ... 
yes . i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place . 
he gave it back to his father . 
i 'm not used to such kindness . from a beautiful woman . 
all right , so i made another deal . 
as opposed to now , <person> <person> <person> ? 
he 's a good boy .

so tony pee-pants starts ignoring <person> . he wanted to play with me . 
we 're getting you out of here , are n't we ? 
hey , kid . you interested in a job ? i just got word from your employment agency that you 're looking for a position in retail sales . 
you think you are a director ? you are a fucking little , small russian piece of shit . and i hate you . i fucking hate you . 
pop , what else can i say ? i do n't wan na be here , they do n't want us here . we should stay in our own neighborhood , stay in bensonhurst . 
it does n't have to be true . it just has to be good . 
<person> court does n't go out with guys like you . she 's a brain . 
yeah , yeah , sure . 
and the other <number> people on the flat , did they hear anything ? 
thorgan , suit up . 
no . 
i 'm not . but there 's -- 
well , what are n't you scared of ? you live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you 're scared shitless to do anything else -- 
look at her legs . 
gardiner is not a foreign agent , there are now sixteen countries investigating the man . we can rule that out . 
what ? 
-- what issues from your lust will be mine . swear it again . 
whatever you like . 
you 're a peach . 
<number> night more wo n't matter . your friend 'll be there . anyway i do n't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch . he knows you 're out so he ai n't going to sit still for it . 
all right . 
looking up at the stars . 
they were walking along the fence past the soccer field . said they were curious about the school so i invited them to the meeting . 
but there was a lot of firing earlier ... 
and his track record , that do n't count ? look , honey , when you watch the <number> shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss . 
and you might get the fucking job . 
well , therapy . and <number> day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back . i was living in a fairy tale . 
not sorry enough for being a fat cunt . 
did you find a scalpel ? did you find a murder weapon ? 
i do n't get it . 
i do n't deserve <person> 's respect . 
main street . 
when he finds the money , you 're as dead as me . 
stop . we are not having a `` duality '' conversation . `` ooh , he has a secret side . <person> , she has a dark side . '' please . <person> is a joke . you get <number> , do you understand me ? you get <number> life . <number> shot . i 'm so tired of women saying `` i have an inner strength '' or `` deep down , i 'm really ambitious . '' `` <number> day i 'll design my own line of clothing and write children 's stories , if i can only remember to return the videos i rented last night . '' if you are something , then you better be out there doing something . you need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night -- with maybe a slight clothing change . there is no gray area . the truth is not somewhere in between . there are <number> sides to every personality , all right -- the reality ... and the lie . we are not having a `` duality '' conversation . 
each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that ... it 's for a giveaway ... a product giveaway by this company ... 
i do n't think that 's why she ran . 
because , my dear <person> , if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon , he might go outside and look at it . have you seen blood in moonlight , <person> ? it appears quite black . if <number> were nude , it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing . 
<person> ? wrong ? what color was it ? ! ! ! 
but you think it 's something else . what ? <number> of ours ? 
slow down ... slow down ... 
over here ! 
from the dream . 
benjamin -- i really do . 
what is it with crack and transsexuals ? 
good luck to you too , <person> . 
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years ? 
aubrey run ! <person> stares in horror at maura - just then the knife fades away as <person> rolls over , returned to normal - 
i am in no position to debate this with you , your majesty , but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the emperor if you should now desert his cause ? it would mean nothing less than victory for england . 
... just for a second . so , now i got that out of my system and i can go back to the thing that makes me happiest . 
you like the wild ones , do n't you ? <person> , <person> and now <person> . you know , i 've always said there 's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers , all those guys that love to pack . 
stop ! 

some of it , yes . 
i am a princess . you have no right to order me about . 
how do you know ? you been there ? 
a break for what ? 
they 'll know . they 'll know as soon as they born . cause it 's inside us , <person> . it 'll be inside them . we 'll pass it down . <person> did n't just change the outside , he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries ... and what it 's worth.. 
the technical term for you is `` chimera '' ... 
eighteen minutes ... 
we 're going to keep driving . 
at home . i could n't face all this traffic . 
yeah . what do you want . <person> , right ? have you ever been to california ? 
louise . 
all set . 
what am i going to do now ? 
you can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell . 
you missed the point . the kid 's a climber ... not very bright ... but if you get down to his level to look at it his way ; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation . he thinks he 's in good standing . 
yes . 
if any form of pleasure is exhibited report to me and it will be prohibited . i 'll put my foot down ; so shall it be - this is the land of the free . the last man nearly ruined this place he did n't know what to do with it . if you think this country 's bad off now just wait 'till i get through with it . the treasury is low on dough ; the last man went and flew with it . if you think we 're short of money now just wait 'till i get through with it . the country 's taxes must be fixed - and i know what to do with it , if you think you 're paying too much now , just wait 'till i get through with it . 
i 'm sure . you 've got nothing but troubles waitin ' for you here . 
not for me . 
who â€™ s she ? 
maybe i 'm going too fast . 
i 've tried to get him to agree to <number> . i just -- i do n't know ... i 'm getting such weird vibes lately . 
or bambi ... or , i do n't know , <person> or butthead ? 
let 's talk about the work that you care so much about . 
[ and ? ] 
you 're making me young again . 
she hardly ever sees him and it 'll be so fast , she wo n't have a chance to tell . 
yes . 
bullshit . you 're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with <number> kids to feed . <person> if i 'll help you do that . 
fine . be that way . <person> <person> . 
you do n't understand anything . 
let 's get something straight , <person> -- i never asked you to leave your wife . 
this is your aunt . <person> <person> . in new orleans . 
yes , i know . <person> , have you ever seen a negro person before ? even had a real conversation with a real negro before ? 
o.k . 
i do n't know . 
forget how to ride a bike . 
we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them . 
no ... ! i have waited too long , fought too hard . now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit ! no ... i will not be your servant ! 
<person> inside . 
bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want ... well 'til eleven thirty maybe . 
alright , <person> . go on home . we might have to call you in for some more questioning . 
i ca n't hear this now -- 
of course , please , this way . your servant may use the kitchen . 
no you do n't . 
aganishish ? yeah , that sounds like <person> . 
only joking . 
ca n't you see that sticker ? 
i 'm dying to hear of his reaction . the thrill of smashing something is n't in the smashing , but in the owner 's reactions . 
out . 
not yet . 
how do you know all this ? 
cecile , i think you 're going to have a hard time crying rape if that 's all he did . 
fun . 
for your sake i hope you 're right . i 'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical . 
what ? 
he did n't look good at all . something strange is going on . he 's got himself into some trouble . he would n't say what . 
there 's a rumor going around , maybe you 've heard it . 
are you hungry ? what 's your favorite food ? we 'll try to get it for you . 
her eyes were turgid with fear , but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level . 
we must ... get you some experience . we must ... leave this place . 
nicky , i let my butterflies die once upon a time and it 's never stopped hurting . that 's right , you heard me , <person> . i 'm still in love with you . 
do i have to pay juice ? 
you have a dog ? what kind ? 
listen , you 're dating <person> , he 's in arizona . you 're fucking me , and we have n't made plans . what could you possibly be up to tonight ? 
someone 's been murdered . not shot , strangled or stabbed , either . <person> limb from limb . there 's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal . 
that 's what i thought , at first . maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party . with my liquor of course . 
that 's okay ? 
i never said ... oh look . that 's just a figure of speech . she said something funny , and i said ... 
okay ... 
we must shut down the building . go wider -- ! 
a hotel ? 
it 's a school night ... back by <number> . 
yeah ... how do we know we wo n't be exploited ? 
i promised myself i would n't let this happen till you were living alone . i was so torn when you called . 
eat your dinner . 
wha . . . <person> -- 
well , it 's not good enough . just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you , <person> ? guy like you . 
you 're supposed to be dead ! 
come on , where 's your enthusiasm ? 
i do n't care what anybody calls me , <person> . long as it ai n't to dirty . and if you fellas get together every year and say , `` <person> , we still want you to run things for us '' , i ai n't gon na insult ya by sayin ' no . 
what 's that gun doing in your room ? suppose i phoned the police and told them there 's a bloke staying in my hotel who 's planning to shoot somebody ? 
how did you know that ? 
int . tunnel - day . 
yeah , nice meetin ' you . 
then lunch in the bois -- 
yeah . 
i know ... 
you went to see mrs. redi ... she told you something -- what was it ? 
definitely . i think you may be a very gifted telepath . 
<person> fabrikant . our producer . 
thanks , king . i 've always wanted to take <number> of these big babies in . 
no , and i 've been calling all night . maybe he 's shacked up . 
i think so . 
you are not a god . 
maybe he 's just shy . 
why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography , <person> <person> ? 
half for doing what ? 
i could n't get to her . it all happened so fast . <person> had her , and i saw him fall ... then <person> told me to run . and then he ... and i remember so clearly , thinking it 's me they want . if i run , maybe they 'll come after me . maybe they wo n't think about her ... so i ran ... 
you think they 're strange ? 
you heard the sky marshall ... move it all down - 
the world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . then be not poor , but break it , and take this . 
i do n't know what you 're referring to , but i do know that if certain older and wiser people had n't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy , everything would be okay . 
oh ! 
i knew that . 
i 'll loan you a raincoat . 
i 'll get dr <person> , we can trust him . 
<person> sent me <number> humidors full of pre- castro cubans . 
i 'll be dipped in shit . i will , too . 
thanks for nothing , you bum . 
you 're a regular nuclear meltdown , honey -- slow down . 
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting . 
you just keep pushing those buttons , those there , send everything at him , okay ? 
i am comfortable . 
and our assets ? 
it really is the best music <number> can hear in vienna today . do n't you agree ? 
what do you think ? 
yeah what 's this , <person> <person> ? 
i thought it was o'neill 's turn tonight . 
i ... do n't know . i ... 
obviously . 
he did n't have to tell ... 
i am aware of dr. <person> 's frustrations . 
imagine our surprise when they began to gestate . my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists , facilitating their programs . to give us access to the virus . in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure . so that we might save ourselves , as the last of the species . your father wisely refused to believe this , choosing hope over selfishness . <person> is the only future he had : his children , the only future any of us have . 
college . have n't really thought about it . 
mrs. stanwyk , may i borrow this picture . i promise to send it back to you . it 's routine , really . the actuarial people need to -- 
i would think so . 
for a healthy baby . for <person> to make it through the delivery . for the phillies to get into the playoffs . 
... and even then ... 
okay . 
okay , <person> . you _are_ a rom construct . 
we had a run in the mass murder section . 
yeah . 
what do you mean ? 
i do n't know ! 
i 'm sure everyone 's doing their best . 
what for ? 
i do n't think i 'm gon na make it , jean . 
i 'm serious , frances . this is important . 
i was n't planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen . 
christ , we got ta go ! the old man does n't cotton to lateness . 
you have a helluva way of answering . 
it 's not really -- 
... i said that before . 
what 's the job ? 
this is before the accident , <person> . do you understand what i 'm asking ? 
i 'm meeting a man tomorrow night . he wants to meet me on east-river drive -- he wants <number> <number> dollars for the book . can you get that for me <person> ? 
how 'd you know my name ... 
how do you think that made him feel ? what does that < u > mean < /u > , `` to go beyond the institution ... ? '' 
what ? 
i want you to find <person> . both of you find some place safe . tell her what happened - everything . she knows people . she 'll know what to do . if we ca n't get <person> my way , she 'll get him her way . 
actually , <person> 's only tough on the outside . 
were you there to catch me ? 
was it a contractor ? 
i burned it . 
is that what you are angry about ? 
it 's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances . 
fuck ! 
yeah , <person> <person> . 
how ... how 'd they know i was here ? 
how am i gon na get past the guards ? 
you do n't have to apologize . the coast is probably clear now anyway . 
does it hurt ? ! you dead-ass , clown-faced fuck , of course it fucking hurts ! what the shit are you gon na do about this ? ! 
i do n't believe this . i 'm calling the doctor . 
what are you talking about ? 
tell him you 're going to elope with him . 
telephone . i suppose you do n't know the phone company killed <person> because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they 'll never let that happen . they control everything : what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end , and -- 
she 's not tied up ! 
please do n't worry , your majesty . leave the worrying to me . as you know , i 'm not an ant of half- measures . i do n't pussyfoot around . this crisis is my number <number> priority , and i promise you it 's being dealt with swiftly , and decisively . 
yes . 
you were there when i last saw him . 
how 'd it happen , peanut ? he just pull out the old toad and let it croak ? 
uh , uh , i think if we can get everyone into it ... we can get out of here . 
eh . fuck it . 
george is great but i know what you mean . 
it 'll have to do . 
hey -- you believe what you want . <person> <person> <person> is innocent . 
i 'm not ready . 
because they do n't want anyone to hear what 's on it , obviously . 
just a second . those are n't water vapor clouds ; they have no moisture content . 
go on , go on -- 
what 's your plan ? 
i 'm your friend . 
no . 
that used to be true , vince . i was with you . but something happened . and i 'm different now . real -- different . i 've had , well , you might call it -- a religious experience . and i 've got just <number> words for you . and those <number> words are ... 
or was it all a dream ? 
<person> dennings ? 
yeah , sure that 's me . ask anybody . 
... yes ...

activating injector assembly . 
yeah , you 've been pretty tough to take . 
the first reports came in at about ten .

good night . 
so i 've just got to put you in , and i am off . 
like ahh ... i do n't know ... <number> <number> dollars . 
he 's got more sense than you have . thank heaven you 're not on this case . 
i have no right to ask for help . i 've never thought of anybody but myself . 
then do n't come sneakin ' around a man 's camp . 
you were great . thanks alot . 
just wanted to say good game . 
do n't be . do n't be sorry for your thoughts . they make me ... react . i do n't know ... all i know is that i ca n't go through another summer where i < u > almost < /u > did something .

no . my father never told anybody he had indian blood . but he still used a few indian words around the house . he called me washee . said it meant ... good boy . 
if i tell you i did n't , <person> , that 's what i mean . 
of course it could -- <person> 's been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember . < u > he < /u > could 've killed <person> .

they had all the pieces they needed . 
[ you 're a liar . <person> 's dead . ] 
yesterday i received an e-mail from a source . in this e-mail were <number> social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit california driver 's licenses to my company late last night . 
i dunno . yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! i did . 
a gentleman has to have a code . this is part of mine . a uniform . think of it as my suit of shining armor .

hopefully , very soon . i 'm just awaiting the final okay from <person> <person> at mgm . 
glad you like it . my wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches . <person> -- that was my wife --

i 'll call you up tomorrow morning . maybe , we 'll go see a movie . 
believe me . the hound of the <person> was an invention of <person> <person> <person> <person> 's . and if you 'd read the bloody book , you 'd find that <person> discovered your house of hell a fraud , a fake . 
how to read . 
if she calms down ... 
yesssss . yes . yes . yes . 
have you tried the emergency system ? 
i killed my mother and a old boy name <person> <person> . i thought they was a-doin ' wrong . i was about your boy 's age . they say i 'm well now from it . 
<number> person thinks he 's doin ' somethin ' good and ever'body else gets upset about it . 
i knew you 'd come . and i knew i 'd have to come up here and talk to you . i could n't let you go back without any word . i came to tell you again -- <person> can not be cured . 
i 'm sure he is . but gettin in- to the `` element '' is a bad idea . 
no . 
success or nothing ? 
it 's very sore . 
so what is it ? 
yes . 
she read it in cosmopolitan . 
no , <person> , i was coming to help you ... 
i 'll do that . 
i 'm sure they are . but what do we accomplish by pointing it out ? 
extra ? 
who , <person> ? yeah , <person> would . he never saw fifty dollars before . you could have bought him for <number> bits . funny thing about <person> . the more he gets - the more he prints . he looks stupid , does n't he ? but oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter . 
you ca n't know for sure , how can you ? i mean , you 're not him . 
me too . i mean i 'm going out with <person> and i 'm ... thinking about you .

it 's good to listen to your daddy . 
you tested over a month ago . i 'm sure they figured it out by now . 
why do n't you shut the fuck up for a while ? you bitch and complain ... if i thought like you , i would have slit my wrist already . 
then why not give <person> <person> the benefit of the doubt ? 
no -- it 's that last runner -- someone in <number> was trying to help him . 
dickie , are you with <person> smith- kingsley ? i bet you are . my aunt thought she saw him .

besides that . <person> mayor do n't bother nobody . nobody do n't bother <person> mayor but you . <person> <person> just mind his business . i love everybody . i even love you . 
but it 's a greenpeace boat . it 'd be so easy . 
no you did n't ! 
i killed her ! 
you killed that cop dutton . 
i should n't stick my nose in other people 's business . it 's just that i like <person> , very much . 
and as a sane person . for you that must be quite a stretch . 
it 's consider a virtue in some corners of the world . 
what 's wrong ? 
burt , i 'm not sure , but i may have asked you to hold my calls - memento blue revisions - <number> 
they musta been beefin ' big time with <number> another , cuz this shit , got way past words , whatever it was .

it does n't work like that . god , you 're gorgeous . want to dance ? 
just like the president . 
we have to pull him . he 's not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the u.n. zorin will eat him alive . 
did you tell anybody ? 
now , it wo n't be as bad as it sounds , <person> . i 've already spoken to <number> therapist , his name is <person> <person> and he 's a friend of mine . he 's also published <number> books and is widely considered to be <number> of the brightest men in his field . i 'm sure it 'll be better than spending the next <number> months in jail . 
and with your help -- 
so ... nice ship you got here . what 's our next move ? 
you did n't tell me you owned a saloon . 
fucking out of order , that . should n't be allowed .

i 've got to feed my cat . besides , i want to get to bed early . 
then you remember more than i do . 
do you know who her doctors were ? 
all right , jesus . 
since going underground , traces of this in-valid have shown up at the scene of <number> serious felonies . do you need any more than that ? 
oh he as clever about that . he called when you were out . that same afternoon , <person> telephoned to him . she said that you were coming , <person> , to ask about wynant . he got terrified . he was afraid that <person> would break down and tell ... so he went to julia and killed her and left <person> 's watch chain in her hand . 
what i did to joey . 
it 's me . put the gun down . maya ... 
and how do you service foreigners . 
yes ! 
depends on what you call love . when i was growing up i had nothing . i learned to want everything . i wanted more than <person> anyway . <person> was my ticket . he 's not much ; he 's older than me , different than me , but he 's got more money than half this town put together . i courted him . i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ? 
... yes . 
i 'm not hungry . 
really ? and how is his state of mind ? 
that 's it ? 
you killed him ?

the car accident you were in ... was there anyone else involved ? 
what do you call it ? you told her you had doubts . 
you mean -- 
no , we 'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying , and we 'll just assume it all went to plan . 
how 's kayleigh doing ? she all right ? 
datura ! <person> knew it ! <person> , he was shouting ! <person> <person> ! 
<number> cents . 
yes . 
what do you want to do ? you want to jam up that sonofabitch <person> .

yes . 
not like <person> , you mean . 
i know , it sucks ! 
will it be possible to have my dog , bijou , sent here ? i was not allowed to bring her and i love her so much . 
i polled my staff . the men say they 'd hang around with him and the women say he 's fuckable . and <number> of the men said he 's fuckable . 
that 's for me to know and for you to find out . i 'll see you . i mean call you , okay ? 
it 's my day off . 
at the gettin ' place .

oh . i brought you something . 
and what are you ? a cop ? 
what ? 
you ! 
i know . i feel the same thing . but we 're between a rock and a hard place . we ca n't keep them without risking their lives and we ca n't let them go without a taking the same chance . 
i 'm not protecting anybody ! that hearing was a farce . what have i done ? 
i -- i will write to the press -- here -- and in england . and i will use the courts . 
why would they bury somebody in the ceiling ? 
what do you have to buy ? 
huh ? 
good . 
a couple of moments , i 'll grant you that . a second or <number> snatched from the jaws of eternity . 
i 've anticipated it , madame . the bicarbonate is ready . 
brain . soul , i 'm telling you , <person> . i was right inside him looking out . we 're going to be rich . 
god , you 're serious , are n't you ? 
<number> sets . i do n't know . maybe they 're not even his .

goodnight , <person> <person> . 
do you have a back up . 
tell me , <person> . please . 
really ? you mean you would n't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this ? 
hey -- i do n't get it . 
then give the empire back to the people ... the children who will grow up to become senators ... 
boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you . 
huh ? what ? 
very popular . are you staying long ? 
no problem . a pair of deuces ? less ? so what ? i bluff . it used to tear me apart when i 'd get <number> of my men killed , but what was i supposed to do ? break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ? of course not , so i bluffed , and after a while , i started to fall for my own bluff . it was great , it made everything so much easier . <person> <person> that why your hand 's been shaking ? 
if i tell you , can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it wo n't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that ? 
bullshit ... i ai n't moving till i get something to eat . you 've been treating me like shit ever since i came out here . if you do n't like it , you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye . and i want some food some place nice.. some good people , nice music ... 
we know that . 
i thought we would meet alone . 
well , <person> , with all due respect , that do n't make a whole lot of sense . 
except she live on the hill and got a grandma . 
no , just give you a splitting headache . 
this kind of thing must happen to him all the time . 
oh , did n't anyone show you the indoctrination video ? 
it ai n't any better out there ! 
uh , ninety days . and now i just have to go once a week . see , i 'm rehabilitated . 
nobody 's lookin ' out for my interests . my credit was fucked ! and then when he promoted <person> over me , i just snapped . so i split . 
we 're not going to wait here like cornered animals . i can tell you that . we need help . i 'm going to talk to that little girl . 
and totally irrelevant . 
i could be lying . 
that they 're going to be upset .

how long does it last ? oh . 
how do you know ?

i was wondering if it 's better to ask your girlfriend for the money ? it could be really easy . i mean , i have all your information , credit card information and billing stuff -- 
thank you . 
no , i like the car . by the way , though , about prom ? that was like a bad idea . <person> i invited you . 
<person> chewbacca . try to get around it . i 'll draw it away .

but alas poor romeo ! he is already dead ; stabbed with a white wench 's black eye ; shot through the ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter <person> ? 
come on , scram ! and stay away from that bus . 
centuries ! where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures ? 
look , i 'm a victim here , too . i was a year away from getting my masters in art , now i 'll never graduate . my life has been permanently disrupted . 
bullshit -- a man will do anything to save his family . who 's running the show up there ?

<number> <number> dollars is a considerable sum ... i 'll have to discuss that with my minister of finance . 
you may stay . but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task . 
then do n't . 
who ? 
it seems to me that the church and our lord are <number> and the same . why must you complicate what is so simple ? 
`` beloved husband '' . `` beloved <person> '' . what can all that mean ? 
i do n't need anything from you . i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain , naked , and , it hit me -- <person> 's birthday . so , here i am , <number> layovers , twenty-seven hours flying and <number> donkey ride later . not necessarily in that order .

dad , you and i have talked about this . <person> and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory . 
well , i have to file a claim ... 
howdy , <person> <person> . we 've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the grange ?

she 's not home yet . take off your coat and come in the living room . i 'll make you a drink . i wan na talk to you .

<number> apple pie ! you want more coffee ? 
... <person> and <person> , <person> and bohort , <person> and <person> , and all the others -- lost to me . only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall . all i have left is the memory of their fellowship . echoes and memories . i am a ghost of the king that once was ... ... mordred is real , alive , my own flesh and blood . i will see him , i must . 
can it be that you want your brother found ? 
no one ever helps me . it 's my job .

and sound . 
it 's blue . blue velvet . 
i wo n't tell mom if you do n't .

so i got the state lookin ' for a ciera with a tag startin ' dlr . they do n't got no match yet . 
why ? 
how would you like the funds ? 
you want control of the crowd -- you ca n't get it by killing their hero . 
i 'm going too . they may need a doctor . 
when <person> was little , he loved to hide . in closets , under the sink . he needed a secret place . but when i 'd look for him , he 'd laugh ... he wanted to be found . 
while he was here . you went about together ? 
you want to bet on whether you won your bet ? this is getting sick . 
we got different information . 
jody , you 're only doing this to get back at your dad . it does n't have that much to do with me . 
a three-second burn to port , on my mark . 
in the capitol for <person> 's nation . <number> days . why ? 
he says he ca n't get away in the daytime .

you 've been working out . 
look , it 's not always luck , i mean , depending upon the placement of the numbers , a guy with <number> cards could win just as easily as a guy with <number> . 
names . 
i do n't need a star . all i need is an actor -- i 'll reshoot the part , cut out <person> and replace her with a real actor . a real leading lady . 
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you ... 
affirmative , <person> <person> . this is united states <person> <person> <person> <person> <person> . over and out . 
ah , well , that is the first rule of warfare . you must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear . you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom . 
and it 's the ninth inning . 
no way , dude ! i 've looked all over for you , and now you have to tell me how to get wendy to like me ! !

mrs. torrance , most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained . they are brought on by emotional factors , and they rarely occur again . 
... nah . i 'm right across the street ... 
why , you - youâ€” <person> here - he may dash us to pieces ! 
whatever you do , however terrible , however hurtful -- it all makes sense , does n't it ? inside your head . you never meet anybody who thinks they 're a bad person or that they 're cruel . 
... everybody . <person> says , 'pat , you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer , and then you go in the back and get laid ? ' 'that 's correct . ' <person> says , 'pat . have you been in this bar ? ' <person> says , 'no , but my sister has ... ' everyone . buy yourself <number> too . 
what i do n't know , i can learn and what i know , nobody can teach . excuse me for saying it about myself , but i think it 's true . what do you think ? never mind what you think . 
is n't that in arizona or something ? 
hold on a tick , let me put on my togs . 
in fact , killing people - 
you . 
you 're here a while , what 's wrong with a bank ? 
they go . 
if we 've got any surprises for each other -- we should n't be in any condition to do anything about it . you play chess ? 
yeah , and that was a fucking miracle . but if they did get away , where the fuck are they ? 
yeah ... 
it 's too dangerous . 
... he did -- but captain d'artagnan blocked his way . 
granted . 
i damn well better be . in fact i want you to phone those goniffs over at gotham insurance and tell them -- 
the does it . it 's going to be this weekend . 
what is that sup ... 
do n't tell me what to do . 
when do you bring'em back ? schumann . 
and my dad says it 's kids . but it 's not rats and it 's not kids . it's- 
a bit sadistic , do n't you think , captain ... ? 
will you think about it ? 
i think she covered you with the parasites . 
but , after all , you have yours . 
then do n't talk about killing . 
you 'll be drinking your own piss ... for the glory of spain ... and admiral colon ... ! <person> ! 
you think you 're better 'n me ? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself , you guv . so i gave him to you . on trust , in the name of science ! and now i want him back . 
okay , chief . 
you 've made me a happy insurance person . 
i 'll be walking out of the bank , unarmed . you 'll have the gun and i 'll drive the car . 
<person> <person> is a teacher , and ... 
yeah , my poor baby . it 's his <person> 's fault . i mean <person> was a good man ... i mean he never hit me or nothing , but <number> day he just got up and went pure devil on us all . 
is n't that great ? i got it when i was in japan with my band . she reminds me of you . 
sure . you think there 's a connection ? 
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you . 
that 's what i 'm telling you . the <number> things : the <number> things : rare strain of flu , no cause to be <person> . and the b-2 bomber ... clear me a space . get me a copy , go rob <number> , get it off the computer , wash post , n.y. < u > times < /u > , 
oh . 
oh , but there is- 
my brother . he fell out of the old beech tree . broke his neck . i was on a camp out . they started going at it , throwin ' things , a real knock down ... they did n't find him 'till the next morning . they did n't even know why he was up there . 
what happens ? 
but why do n't you tell him ? a girl who was with us has disappeared . 
he was n't there . 
oh dear . 
when i 'm guest of honor ? 
whatever it is , it 's none of your concern . 
not having that , which , having , makes them short . 
i think you liked it with him . 
<person> ! 
probably . you know she talks to everybody , and not just him . 
shit , it ai n't hard to play pool . i can teach you everything ya need ta know . 
well , no , <person> , it was the bank 's . that 's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it . you explain it to him . 
-- before you lose your emotional lunch . 
a gift . courtesy of our courteous hotel manager , <person> <person> . we , dear brother , are a fucking smash . yup . they want us back . easter . it seems they have this egg hunt every year . only not for kids . adults . they stuff these plastic eggs with <person> and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn . then afterwards , they have a dance . an egg dance . everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open . it 's our job to separate the yolks from the whites . <person> business . 
and how would you know that ? 
how about dangerous curves ? 
self-realization . ministering to help people reach their fullest potential . would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization ?

hey , slow down you 're gon na miss the turn ! 
i understand . pity to mess up a nice clean boat .

i ask questions . if i get sensible answers then they get to go to america . if i do n't get sensible answers they do n't . is there anything about that that you do n't understand ? 
yah , ya think ?

it just so happens we 're not in kansas anymore . our little angel 's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood . she 's staying with my aunt up in connecticut while <person> sells his house . can you imagine what this would do for my reputation ? screwing the new headmaster 's virginal daughter before school starts ? it will be my greatest victory .

<number> or <number> days ! while <person> is in their hands ? 
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . do n't you , <person> ?

pleasantville <person> ? 
i do n't think so . in my experience , signs are usually a lot more subtle .

we 're not sure . she 's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they 've said different things . some of 'em are callin ' it -- -- epstein-barr virus , and the rest are callin ' it ... <person> <person> <person> ... 
no need to decide now . be like the fish . let whatever happens happen . 
almost quaint . 
number <number> . i saw the yellow man go into <person> 's building , laughing with <person> . now . the only trouble is . what does this prove ? 
after i ... 
somebody must be suffering somewhere , you 're being so nice . 
after torpedo room : report ! 
i was just showing emotion . 
scared to make a mistake . supposing she 's right ... supposing she really has been sent by <person> ? ?

naturally . 
what ? who ? 
there are better things . you see the importance of the `` moment '' . <number> minutes early or late , he 'd have seen death . he 'd have suffered it . this way , he already departed . without knowing . 
well you know it 's okay . 
my secretary . 
ellie , the only <number> holding you to that standard is you ! the people want to hear your story , they need to hear it ! 
i 'm not listening . 
so the woman 's married . she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it . but you do n't reveal her name , you protect her . it sounds like you 're saying it 's okay as long as her husband does n't find out about it . like the guy who cheats on his wife , saying what she does n't know wo n't hurt her . 
too young for what ? 
cash or check , <person> ? do n't do this to me . 
what ? 
my roommate 's very social -- somebody from justice was over and ... i always hear things before they happen . hey , and from now on , so do you .

`` maybe we 're ragged and funny . '' 
<person> â€™ s not found , your parents worry , talk of hiring help to find him , even mention their manhunter friends perhaps ... and adonis panics , takes control , brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward , not before <person> â€™ s found anyhow . he must have kicked himself when he learned i â€™ d exceeded his expectations . 
i 'm gon na make love to you . that 's what i 'm gon na do .

i am father <person> . i am a chaplain here . i thought you might like to talk to someone . 
we 're not interested . 
i got partners . 
i wanted the choice . the chance to prove myself , my skills , my work , me . that 's how it should 've been . 
on screen . 
i like to see girls of that caliber . by caliber , i mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character ... forget it . 
sure we believe you , only now we want you to believe us . that car better be back here by noon tomorrow , or there 's going to be fireworks . 
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name . 
yes . he never forgave him for it . 
hey , do n't tell us about private property . this is america , my friend . 
first of all , economic reasons . it was cheap . the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . it also seemed ideal in most other respects . it was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand . 
if anyone deserves it , it 's <person> and me . we 're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment . 
does n't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ? where will we get them ? 
the little brenner girl ? 
okay ... you smoke <person> de monterreys . you â€™ re a scotch man , single malt , not because it â€™ s trendy but because you â€™ ve been doing it for forty years , and you stay with what works . you have <number> great loves in your life , your horses and this company . you wept openly the day the dow hit ten <number> ... 
i gave her my word , <person> . 
what did you find ? 
both . now . 
yes , well unfortunately i ca n't just switch the `` on '' button to `` off . '' the sad fact of the matter is that you 've unintentionally rubbed off on me . 
hey . hey . if you do n't mind , use the back stairs , all right ? 
what a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time . tell max i want to be buried with royalties ... 
i do n't remember . i was drunk . 
but see , he stopped before i got that feeling , that 's why it seems weird to me . i mean , i 'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile , and i would except it never occurs to me , i 'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself . 
that is not me . 
but dad , you guys truly hated each other , i mean really hated each -- 
no . 
good and bad . they think that 's what caused this . me eye tumor . microwaves from the screen . it 's the size of a grapefruit . <person> too .

to quarter-horses . 
damn near . and a damn near perfect drug . 
no , <person> <person> . you 're the one who needs to do some thinking . 
this place empty as a tomb , mon . 
was he swallowed ? 
<person> 's been lying again . 
they meet on main street . her horse has just died . he 's coming from the fire . 
leave your sister out of it . 
that would have been quite a coincidence . 
pooh-bear , i do n't mean to be rude , but i get the feeling you are n't taking me seriously . 
fuck you ! 
aw , <person> , he 's sick . 
must have changed that law . 
big-ass titties ? 
com'on , tell me . 
try and control this ... 
call the police . <person> , that 's <number> option . 
rug-peers did not do this . i mean look at it . <person> trophy wife . marries a guy for money but figures he is n't giving her enough . she owes money all over town -- 
that 's very simple . i was home . 
i was here , hosting a party . who was killed and why do you think i can help ? 
<number> or <number> days . 
i was n't waiting for a bus . 
he 's so dreamy . he 's like ... a greek god . he 's the cutest guy here . he 's boss . he 's fab . he 's ... 
<person> developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator is n't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real . 
do what i say ! now ! 
i think . but why 'd they make him up like ... <person> <person> ? 
i always thought it was a more intimate relationship . 
are , too . 
oh , i do n't know . no , we 'll go anywhere you want . 
i ca n't tell you . i 'm sworn to secrecy . 
he was just born , remember ? this is the first one . you know that guy , dr. gene scott ? he said that the story of <person> is the story of christ , just disguised . well , i thought about that even before i heard him say it . hold on , let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time . 
he rents it for the summer . <person> always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . most a these guys ca n't keep a job . when the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride . 
i do n't know that ellie . he might get out . <person> 's not bein ' straight with the witness , she could be in deep shit if she identifies him , and it 's my job to convince her she wo n't be . 
you know , he 's been wanting a mitt . 
hi , <person> . 
if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes . 
miss . may i ? 
<person> blair , maybe you 're right about this . but we 've got to be rational . we 've got to talk this over . i 'm unarmed and i 'm coming in . 
i do n't care if you 're president of the company ! i need that voucher ! now ! 
i 'm <person> <person> , i 'm an accountant , i 'm from whitehall and <person> , i was sent here to do your books and i 'm terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady . 
scared of a girl ? 
help me ! i do n't want to die ! 
have you seen <person> ? 
... ... ... .. it 's a bomb is n't it ? 
oh , dear . 
take it from me , you never do . but congratulations . nice to be married , is n't it ? 
how long 's he been here ? 
you ever read <person> <person> ? how did you ever get your doctorate without reading <person> ? good . <person> , let 's turn over gently . right side . 
sure . i would n't blame you , either . 
what was <person> doing outside ? 
well , what are we gon na do about it now ? 
would you tell her <person> 's here ? 
sure . 
yes , ma'am ... ? 
have n't you had enough ? do n't think and <person> . 
<person> wo n't let me go to the desk . he makes me sit on the floor . 
that <number> -- how you gon na take him ? they 'll see him . 
you 're not working at random house , i talked to them . 
nope . 
how 'd she meet <person> ? 
555-4202 . 
yes ! yes ! let 's get on with it . 
they 're withholding payment . 
<person> smith . 
i just want a word with <person> <person> . 
yeah , well , <person> trusted me . we 're best friends . 
emma ! i will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner ! 
everybody knows who you are . you 're famous . 
i ca n't eject . 
and you 're certain you can find the way back ? even in the dark ? 
<person> leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator , but either you have it turned off , or it is malfunctioning ... if it 's damaged , <person> , could fix it , if you like . 
you dream about dead guys ? 
they sell fake memories . 
no , not everything ? the sun is still shinning . it 's a beautiful day out . some things are ok . <person> ? 
i thought everything was working out fine . 
i do n't know . 
i already checked . there are some pretty serious couples in there . 
what ? ? ? ? ? 
a thousand things . 
do n't let them take me , <person> -- 
send feed-back into the control sensors in that detention block . 
but see that 's just the point . it ca n't stop at once . because it 's in you . and you ca n't stop something that 's in you . 
well ... i 'm not gon na put you out of your bed ... 
would n't be no use . i 'd still see 'em inside the tent . 
was it <person> <person> ? 
and find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the humvee , and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off , but that 's about it . 
i felt like such a shit , pilgrim , after what i did to you -- not that i did anything wrong -- that i kept investigating , poking around . there 's some poor s.o.b . in l.a. with his face all bent out of shape who you 've damaged his movie career . <person> for him , people do n't look at his face . 
what ? 
yeah ? 
if you were the lady who gave me a ring , my mother says i have to give it back to you . 
-- my god , <person> ? ? ? 
the plane is fine . 
a card ? 
nick , you 're so strange ... 
that 's what life is , <person> . full of chances to hurt yourself , or somebody else . 
i would have killed him . 
come on -- do n't pull that . you know you 'd give your right -- . what are you staying away from him for ? 
my guess is that she turned him down . 
i 'm coming up there <person> ! i 'm coming to get you ! <person> , i 've got to get him ! 
flattery will get you everywhere , my boy . but i 'm afraid i have to trust floris on this one . you see , she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from <person> <person> . perhaps you 've read her memoirs , `` i ca n't understand a word any of you are saying . '' 
i got ta friend over there . he was telling me things are kind of slow . so , i figured i 'd give him a call , have him come down here and look through your records . you know , give him something to do . 
do n't lie to me . 
well , no ... i-i know , i just , uh ... no , i-i , eh , you know , i , i did n't , i did n't know you sung . 
nothing . i just prefer the other <number> . 
<person> borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i do n't get if i qu -- it 's too complicated . i -- besides ... 
all right , <person> . 
what about relatives ? 
you sure ? 
where would she have gone ? she was a child , and beautiful , heartbreaking merciless child . and i had made her that ... 
yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us . 
remember that <person> <person> stuff we almost got nailed on ? 
what 's okay ? 
i 'm afraid so -- i ca n't compete with you physically . and you 're no match for my brains . 
what 's wrong with a magic trick ? 
no . 
... i 'd really have to show it to you . 
i do n't think we have anything to talk about , <person> <person> . 
who had to put a gun to your head ? 
yes . up here on the fifteenth floor . <person> . 
no , man , i think i 'll have a vodka . 
i miss you so much , <person> . i want so much to be with you ... 
i suppose that 's good , unless things were fine the way they were . 
yes . 
the man that marries <person> <person> must first kill me -- do you mind that ? 
oh that explains everything . 
well , that defies the point , do n't it ? 
young man , i am no stranger to theatres . i 'm no stranger to insolence ! 
you got <number> ? 
better late than never . 
exactly . now that you have the studio behind you , we can really do things . 
drink , drink , <person> . you 'll never have it so good . 
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ? 
what will happen ? 
nothing 's real . 
but i got <number> <number> and fifty coming . it 's my share . <person> owes me . 
chief , we found a witness that says he saw <number> teenagers leaving <person> ' room shortly before we arrived . 
real good . 
fast . 
and ? 
i do n't know , honey . different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die . some believe in heaven or hell . some think we 're born again as little children -- 
many others . 
it does n't matter ! just get out of the goddamn building ... 
fine . thank you , <person> <person> . 
yes , sir . 
it 's a mosquito bite . 
well , let 's go down and ask him . 
stop pressuring me ... 
he 's taken over the case because ... they 're annoyed the previous chap let <person> ... disappear when he was the only , he was the only suspect in freddie 's murder . 
ok. increase the peace . 
are you open ? 
you 've seen me ... 
we 're goin ' now ! <person> . 
nothing , if you work in a fill- ing station . and i 'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket , and those same baggy pants . <person> , what 's a good men 's shop in town ? the very best ... well , go there ! 
it 's true . 
but ... how could they have evolved so quickly ... ? 
swell . i appreciate it . 
i make special tea for you , <person> , okay ? we 've to live like brothers . we have to be in here together . 
we were n't expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington . 
no , i 'm not worried . 
oh yes . i 'm very lucky . 
i know . and i 'm sorry . i 've been consumed with ... my daughter left ... for school . 
that 's what you want , is n't it ? 
i 'm here with <person> . 
i 'm allergic to onions . 
it 's from paris . 
eighty proof . what d'ya say ? think you can handle it ? 
in an hour they 're gone ! 
hold on . 
getting to what ? 
throw pillows , <person> . the sales lady said they 're the latest thing . 
why ? 
sure you did . 
but does n't <person> dive without anything ? 
what did you think then ? 
eyes closed . 
exactly . those very words have been my guiding light in what is , after all , a dark and often hostile world . 
yeah . 
what about you coming down here ... ? 
i can see why . 
helena , if i had it i would give it to you , but i do n't have that kind of money . 
i 'll just take a minute . <person> <person> <person> . you know what i 'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a dr. <person> <person> , you know who he is ? 
oh . that . <person> . 
sandy , can you home in on that beam ? 
they put bombs on dolphins ... . 
oh , now he 's adorable . 
jesus , <person> , it ai n't science , you know . you got your good trades and your bad trades . that 's how it works . 
mm , in a horizontal and wet way ! 
ca n't , sistah . 
why ? 
wait and see . 
<person> <person> , he discovered electricity . 
i 'm sorry , but he knew about our gettin ' hit on <number> big machines in a row and he did nothing about it . that means either he was in on it or , forgive me for saying this , he was too dumb to see what was going on . either way , i can not have a man like that workin ' here . 
who is n't ? 
again ? ! <person> ! 
<number> <number> ! you lied to me , <person> <person> . you 're a bald-faced liar ! 
for <person> 's <person> ... i told you before ... nothing . <person> , i ca n't stay in here too long at this hour ... will you please listen to me ? 
i do n't know . there 's only <number> way to be absolutely sure . 
where is he ? 
means you keep me using my head , and that 's good ! 
great . that 's great . 
i did n't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth , but i 'd bet my next check that that 's where he was about to put it . 
an `` automaton '' ? ! please ! i 'm a biomechanical organism . well , what 's left of <number> . what 's left of all of them , actually . i am the last ... ... and `` these fragments i have shored against my ruins . '' t.s . <person> . you would n't know him yet but you 'll just love him , he 's divine , if a little dour . <person> shy though ... hiding over here ... 
is he here ? 
do n't touch anything . 
later <person> . i got ta take care of someone who 's hurt here , in case you have n't noticed . 
<person> said ... the raven passed this way hours ago . 
yeah , right . 
come â€”- you 'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island . 
it 's terribly hard . sometimes the temptation is just too much . 
right . just remember , mates . <person> <person> 's the name . anything you need to get , move or watch , i 'm your man . 
why not ? 
oh i do n't know , i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you would n't admit to in a <number> years . 
yeah , he 's punchy . talking to himself . 
see if they make sense . to begin with , i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer 's sick mind . 
yeah . are you sure mommy 's not home ? it 's very late . 
they 're topside . we 're ready to take you home , sir . 
yes . 
i need more proof , that 's all . anybody can get lucky once . 
chuy . he was taken . he 's down here somewhere ... oh , please , hurry . i saw what was after her . 
oh . you 're a smart little bastard are n't you ? it 's kind of like a restricted ticket . you got ta leave the same way you came . 
<person> . what my daughter is on about , mr <person> , is that <person> is somewhat of a bohemian . you might as well know that ... 
what was i supposed to do ? 
you have a phone call . 
well , it 's friday night and you 're a beautiful girl . i guess you would have a date , that does that . 
i think you want a drink . how about it , judge ? 
i -- i discussed it with him -- yes -- because i -- you see , i 've always had this camp in mind -- but i made no contract with him ! 
what makes you think you 're so almighty ? telling people what to do and how to act when you do n't even know how yourself . 
oh , for <person> here - 
it 's the story or salome . i think i 'll have demille direct it . 
this is ridiculous , <person> . find her . 
only my share . 
why 'd you stay behind ? ! 
sometimes opposites attract . 
please ! ! no ! ! ! 
i know this has been painful , spock . for me too . thank you . 
you ai n't seen nothin ' like these rock whores . they ass be young man . they got that fine young pussy . bitches want the rock they be a freak for you . they give you hips , lips , and fingertips . 
then screw you . i 'll rot . 
hey , little <person> <person> . 
the big house ? 
a merger ? how long will you be gone ? 
bullshit , bullshit , you assign them ... what are you telling me ? 
what do you believe in ? 
< u > really < /u > ? would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney 's working hypothesis ? 
in the morning , darlin ' , in the morning , we are g-o-n-e and you are f-r-e-e. now , i know i put you guys through hell , and i know i 've been <number> rough pecker , but from here on end you guys are in my cool book . <person> , help me pick <person> up , and lay him down . <person> , keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says , `` digayo . '' when you get to digayo , turn this big bastard left , go on down for a few miles , then you see a bar called `` the titty twister . '' from what i hear , you ca n't miss it . 
i borrow it without telling him ... . 
no , no , no . we 'll use the floss to get to the ledge . 
i do n't think about it <number> way or the other . but if you want , give me a day or <number> , and i 'll get back to you . now i 'd like to go home . 
we 're americans . 
my cannon . 
even tried you at home . we 've got a situation here . 
take a look at this . slightly different approach . 
about twenty-four thousand . 
your leg must be getting better . 
i 'm sorry . 
i commend you . if you 're going to pursue poofs , go after those who can do favors for you . you waste everybody 's time when you court dinosaurs . 
yeah . 
<person> christmas yourself , < u > officer < /u > . 
how was it ? 
lando 's not a system , he 's a man . a gambler , con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ... ... your kind of guy . the system is called <person> . it 's a ways from here , but reachable . 
forget it . 
it wo n't work . 
sure i do . 
sure . 
you mean a man you can control . 
doing what ? sir wilfred tipping the scales . ruining that delicate balance between good and evil . i think that our <person> <person> has found a very effective way of doing it . there 's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being , containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form , and feeding him the soul of a believing victim , you can bring him back to life ! 
i 'm wydell ... this is naish . 
what do you want me to do about it ? 
and i suppose you 're the knight . 
when you get to fiji ? 
<person> pinsley . from high school . that 's how i knew you were here . when you called , from the airport . 
the last time you do this , you left me a pistol , with <number> shot . 
the bowery , you got ta deal with runoff from <number> bridges . 
well , it 'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it . do n't you think ? 
then all my surgery is no good . there 's something wrong with the child -- something i do n't know -- something i ca n't define -- ca n't diagnose . i can do nothing for her . 
we 'd better see . 
do n't stop now ! please ... 
you have n't heard the carpenters like this . <person> . 
... <number> moment , <person> <person> ... 
well , i 'm not saying that i want to join or anything , but ... but i know you guys believe in reincarnation , you know , so it interests me . 
and who 's <person> ? 
it 's hong kong , not tokyo . my country asked for the best . i told them that was you . now i will show you around my Å“hood . 
no . 
just like it . 
how the hell should i know ? i 've never had a wife killed before . <person> <person> ! < u > you < /u > want this job , you do n't know how to do this ? i guess i should have hired a professional . 
i played that game , <person> . in my head i played it a thousand times . 
i 'm saying now you do know . so it 's time for you to fuck off . 
is n't everybody part of everybody else ? 
i 'm not sure i agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework , there , <person> . 
thanks , <person> <person> . thanks for everything . 
derek ! 
so i 've heard -- 
i think , <person> <person> <person> , you have had too much drink . your chaplin , <person> <person> , has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter , of which she is a considerable expert . 
terrible . <person> ! i met the most beautiful girl i 've ever seen in my life ! 
would n't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives ? 
i 'm going to california . 
i ca n't help you there . 
i am not . 
in a saloon ? 
buzz me the minute she comes in . 
yeah ! that 's it . i do n't know . maybe it was n't . i got ta go . 
i would n't do that ... 
then why ca n't i go in there ? 
what kind of a silly thing was that to do ? 
well <person> is great and ... we are the best . 
oh come on -- 
just ... water . 
y'know , <person> , i know <person> is ya brother and shit , but the next time he hits ya , the next time he touches ya , you should `` house him . '' kick his ass . 
no sense worrying about it now . 
yep . there 's some great places nearby . 
so ? 
do n't worry about that . now , i want you to say 'doggy . ' 
but , <person> <person> , you -- 
folks 'll ask question . 
no sense at all . i 'm a little stressed . 

do n't tell me , i do n't want to hear it . it 's probably all fucked up , anyway . 
it 's too late for that . 
well , i , uh , i 'll be leaving town for a little while . 
try stupid . 
ok. claudia <person> : you tryin ' to go deaf ? 
you 'll have to speak up son . i have this ringing in my ears . my doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations . i 've had <number> operations on my heart . 
well , you know , you know , that 's a lie , i , i ... 
but , sir ... 
what do you mean ? 
good . 
you thought he was carrying a knife ? 
place is great . really . <number> great place ... basketball , bowling . you name it . <person> . hearts . lots of guys are making salad bowls . what i 'll do is make a salad bowl for you , unless you 'd rather have a pencil holder . the pencil holder 's neat , i mean -- 
the duck ? 
hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch . 
in that event , the probabilities are that our mission would fail . 
give me the bat . 
you do n't know . 
i mean , i 'm not much use anymore . why ca n't they be compassionate to me ? 
hello , <person> . how are you ? 
verona again . 
hi .

i will . and good luck with your show . i hope it 's a huge success . you 've worked very hard . you deserve it . 
behave ! 
i 'm sorry . 
that would hardly be possible . 
watch my stuff . 
that 's right . 
totally ! look ! 
then i have no idea . 
he was so confused by what i was doing , i do n't think he even noticed . any word from the enterprise ? 
if you 're telling the truth , it means we can save you . 
just great ! see ya around ! 
practically . 
please put your clothes on 
no thanks . it 's not that far . 
so shoot him . wo n't have to feed him that way --

uh-huh . he 's the , uh ... 
we can use the flamethrower . 
not right now , thanks . 
drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . <person> is completely overwhelmed . 
okay . 
just phone calls , right ? they ring , you answer , they do n't say anything , just blank . kids getting kicks . burglars looking for an empty apartment . i mean there is nothing that proves -- 
oh , i do n't have no plans . no plans at all . 
i come home and you tell me we 're going to drive a psychotic horse to <person> ! i ca n't just pick up and leave ... 
oh . oh , yeah . no . this is a different <number> . 
congress , the fbi , <person> <person> , it do n't matter who the hell `` they '' is . `` they '' know who `` they '' are , that 's all that matters . now , did you go to any meetings ?

hey , i get good benefits , a good early retirement plan , nobody ever bothers me ... 
oh , you ! i 'm not talking about her hands . they 're difficult to ignore , i confess , but i 'm speaking of her whole being . her whole being is extraordinary . the way she talks , for example . she 's so articulate . 
good morning , quince .

give it to <person> <person> . he will see it rightfully home . wessex gives his purse to viola . 
no . me neither . 
you waited til tonight to tell me ? 
i 'm just trying to figure what interests me more : the possibility that <person> is the guy , or you making him absolutely the guy . 
i do n't know . 
he 's a friend of yours , you want to help him out . tell me this , though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation ? i 've yet to see it . never a courtesy . never a thank you note . he forgets my wife at christmas time - 
lauder , <person> <person> ! 
agnes , i do n't believe that . tell me . i 'll protect you from her . 
hey , i asked you if you wanted some chicken . 
yeah i 'm sure ! i did it with my own hands !

how ya doin ' <person> <person> ? 
fancy it ? 
well , that 's got nothing to do with this case . can i handle this my way ? 
ulcers . 
they 've closed the set . they sent everybody home .

what happened to your hand ? 
got compliments coming outta your ass , do n't ya ? 
then why go there ? 
okay , norman , listen , i really want to talk about this at home . i think it 's a matter for your analyst ... and mine . 
stay out of my face or i 'll go straight to max . 
we ca n't . 
for example ? 
you look alike . 
... maintenance facility ... 
why would n't she tell me ? there 's no way ! she could never keep that to herself ... you 're crazy . 
i do n't feel like talking , if you do n't mind . 
you are . i joined up to get out on my own . and you had to tag along . 
right in there , pal . 
i worry because you do n't . it 's my job . i 'm feeling guilty . i would 've liked it if you waited until the <number> of you were on more solid ground . 
gibarian said he thinks <person> should be destroyed .

yeah ... 
maybe i should reconsider my ... 
hendricks . i want to go over your reports and your form <number> . 
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan . the shuttle 's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue , flooded both ships with pure oxygen . there was a spark and both ships were incinerated . the skipper and <number> others just made it to a lifeboat . <person> <person> was able ... 
i saved your life is what i did ! 
that 's right ! you were smarter than us then and you 're smarter than us now ! so do n't blame me for how your life turned out . it 's not my fault . 
the whole city 's together on this one . we took a vote . everybody 's down on you , you know . 
now , i want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles , okay ? 'cause that 's what 's gon na win this game . 
you know , you saved my life . and i just wanted to say ... i forgive you for talking during the movie . <person> . 
who gives a fuck ? ! i was just fucking with him ! 
you mean like fucking <number> virgins at once . 
you found us okay ? 
we were just studying . 
you better get a garlic t-shirt , buddy . 
you 're androids . 
of course ...

do n't you have a maid ? 
we ca n't leave without you ! 
i believe you . please ... 
sure . 
well , you can trust <person> <person> <person> . 
joey ! 
so ... how did they get here ? 
the d.a . gave me immunity . 
the pure horror , it both repels and attracts them . because in their collective unconsciousness , they have the agony of childbirth . the blood . the blood is horror . 
you know what 's ridiculous ? your libretto , that 's what 's ridiculous . only an idiot would ask <person> to work on that stuff ! 
what ? 
well ... <number> <number> readers ... i know exactly what they want . chapter <number> : `` a childhood behind <person> <person> . lovely little princess plays with <person> 's <person> . '' 
i 'm sorry .maybe i better go <person> . 
wrong . 
and when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ? 
it 's a bet . you 're the witness , <person> . 
i 'd be really ungrateful , if i did n't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when i did n't know where to turn . 
<person> less go <person> . 
but i have my clothes on ! 
this is kind of a stream -- 
do you want the car ? 
i 'm on sunset . near the beverly hills hotel . wan na meet me for a drink in the polo ... ? 
a ford ... we have a ford . 
should do something to them . 
this is where <person> and <person> brung us . 
do n't bother . here 's a bus ... 
i could kill you now . 
that 's nice . 
i 'm not supposed to tell . not until you 've counted too . we 're each supposed to make an independent count . 
that 's the best i can do . ... but minute-by-minute , i find myself lingering . 
well , i do n't know if sorry can make up for it . i found your remarks highly offensive . 
... i 'm a priest ! i 'm here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it . 
really ? 
okay . <person> , <person> , that 's just great . meaning to life ... mmm ... . 
rayisha . <person> nice . 
what 's the difference ? 
<person> march . who the hell are you ? 
thanks . 
but clear ... so very clear ... for the first time ... all of it ... 
... the ... 
funded by whom ? 
if you do , <person> <person> , you 're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is ! excuse me . 
really ? for most people it 's a rather pleasant experience . what exactly did you ... 
okay ! ley me out right here . i 'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you . i 'll walk it . 
reading . 
the ritual to bring the body of anck- su-namun back to life . 
i guess i have what you 'd call a love-hate relationship with <person> . 
we have to get out of here <person> . 
what 'look ' ? 
this is about her negative attention , not mine . did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet ? 
look , i do n't have time for you , get out of my way ! ! 
my experience -- <number> years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the enterprise , this crew ... 
out the northern sally-port . <person> for the east side of the swamp until you clear the french picket line . head north over the ridge , then come about southeast and fork left in little meadow and you 're free of the outpost and skirmishers ... 
do you know who <person> june is ? 
we 'll never know , will we ? 
i 'm too messed up to teach . 
can you really see through anything ? 
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first . 
you feel sorry for the husband ? 
okay . 
certainly . 
yes . it did n't matter much to them as long as i disappeared . 
vincent ? 
i 'm <person> <person> . i represent the environmental protection agency , <person> <person> . 
i had him in my grasp . 
did you do any of that ? 
you want to help ? stay the fuck away from her . 
emma ! 
no , mam ... i come from way back there . me and my dog was tryin ' to find my daddy and we got lost . 
you 're being narrow-minded . 
huh . 
if you 're waiting for `` do you take this man ? `` , that 's considered poor form . 
i do n't know . i had n't thought much about it . 
the c.i.a . 
what next ? you leave promptly , of course . there is no question as to whose home this is -- 
so i 'm told . 
oh , i believe it . 
i was appalled , just as you are now . 
i know you did n't mean it when you killed her , and now you 'll make it right . 
that would be impossible . 
security camera got you coming outta the stairwell , weapon in your hand , going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient . it 's embarrassing to the professional community , is what it is . 
that 's my joint . the swinginest nightclub in town . 
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment . 
yeah , iris . you know anybody by that name ? 
well , i did n't learn that from him . 
i 'm at nirdlinger 's . let yourself in . 
yes . i see your point . 
he said he stayed with <person> . 
oh , no - you do n't want to go yet , honey . she 'll stick around too . is that right ? 
are you married ? 
it 's an esoteric journey . 
he 's fine . 
you 're the one with the star-spangled hard-on , not me . 
how 'bout a cold drink ... ? 
<person> ' ! 
no ... you want me to give him a message ? 
where is he , <person> ? 
you do n't really think i 'd leave <number> <number> dollars worth of our chips in her bag ? what matters is n't what 's real . it 's what we < u > think < /u > is real -- what matters is the art . 
not a problem . 
no , treves , it 's out of the question . now if it was up to me , i 'd say `` certainly , let 's meet the fellow , by all means , '' i 'm sorry , i simply ca n't speak for the other members of the committee . 
what 're you doing out of uniform , <person> ? you do n't want to get in trouble . 
okay . i 'll call you back . in an hour . do n't tell <person> . 
no , just crap . i want some picture frames . 
it was the only way , auggie . otherwise , she was n't going to let me see her . 
but see tonight wives and girlfriends are n't invited . 
let 's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres . 
<person> boy america . help me <person> , help me get her out of my -- 
success ! ! our device works perfectly ! we will begin mass production immediately ! 
do you think a lot about girls ? 
she was going to leave you anyway - 
you do ? 
okay , okay . 
you know where the chemicals are ? 
if i ever won a pot that large the boat would sink . 
it 's really nice of you to help us . 
okay , so you 're a victim . 
nigel , you 'll just have to use your hands- 
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in . 
vampires . we thrive on blood . 
really ? 
<person> gordon . 
it 's not just the money . i could make money in my sleep . 
no , <person> . 
shoot , it 's got ta be in the millions , maybe more . 
what did you say ? 
there are straps in back . 
who 'd pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists . 
it is really weird looking . it 's like it 's not even real . i ca n't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things . 
nothing . nothing happend . go away . 
so there are no guests staying on that floor ? 
pardon me , i 've had a few things on my mind -- like putting this safari together . 
he 's turned into a drug fiend , he shot people from helicopters in vietnam , he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children . he sees a shrink in l.a . he 's all fucked up . now he 's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... if he gets away with it , everybody will follow his lead . he must be stopped at all costs . 
ok , ok , i 'll give it back . 
i do n't want them to arrest you . 
too bad . what did your father do ? 
oh , beware of jealousy , my lord , the green-eyed monster ... 
pause play . 
because i think you 're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money . 
yes 'm . 
so we kill him ? 
done poisoning the youth for the day ? 
< u > i do n't know < /u > . <person> talked those punks into letting <person> out . he 's fucking us over , <person> . that guy is fucking us over . 
really ? 
tim . 
why , no . . . do n't be silly . 
sadly , no . well except for the lint . 
my i.d . cards . 
... and therafore there is no consequence ? 
has n't she had enough ? 
he 's a vacuum cleaner salesman . 
you know , when somebody gets electrocuted , their skin starts smoking . at least <person> 's did . 
yeah ? 
yeah , well how the hell you get something like that wrong ? that 's a damn big boat . it 's either sunk or it ai n't . 
she 's with her grandmother . she 's with <person> 's mom . she spends a lot of time over there . <person> 's ... well , she 's <person> . 
oh zippidy-doo , they 'll find my fingerprints . can i go in ? i need some stuff . 
i just wonder what could be more important than what 's going on with dad . 
i thought we decided you were going to school here . at u of <number> . 
i 'm aware that i do n't look so great , but i thought you 'd be glad to see me . 
look at me . 
why not ? 
i deserve it . 
precisely . 
yes , sir . you would n't believe it . 
the name is <person> , and i 'm running this show . 
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back . there 's cars back there , right ? 
oh god . i 'm overbearing and rude . lily . lily finn . 
i swear . 
i 'm sorry . i 'll get my things . 
well something just happened to the power upstairs ... maura heads off and shakes her head , troubled by the event - 
do n't thank me , yet , but it is important to know where you 're going and who your friends are ... 'know what i mean ? 
what do you want ? 
<person> < u > says < /u > he 's sure . 
that 's very flattering . 
answer affirmatively . <person> . keep those answers to <number> words . you were n't ` part of a group , ' you were her anesthesiologist . is n't that right ? 
look . <person> . <person> . you want to write ? write . 
i can already tell this is n't going to work . 
duets ? but can we trust him ? 
poor fucker my ass ... 
that ... sawing and hammering . 
men of all races -- nationalities -- 
yeah . 
< < belch > > 
it 's because he desires you . the women get all the breaks at these conferences . 
i did n't put him in a wheelchair . <person> did . he can get around without <number> -- it 's all in my report . 
what ... ? 
that 's not faith , it 's physics . the second law of thermodynamics . 
that ... thing . that nun thing . take it off . 
what do you mean ? 
call <number> . 
it 's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible , <person> <person> . the insulin produces a state of coma , a stupor . the patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock . that nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind . 
yes . 
he 's good at what he does . 
what do you mean ? 
are you ? 
splendid , <person> . <person> 's hop over to <person> <person> . it 's a great place to save a face . 
loyal , cooperative , resourceful c. c. baxter . 
i did n't spit on you ! 
i 've booked you a flight and packed you a bag . you just need to get into a car and go . 
not on that leg . 
or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat . 
that 's good . i 'm glad . <person> love , as they say . 
i know , kid . i know . me too . 
i do n't know if i can picture <person> <person> body surfing . 
basically ... 
... badge someday , then you can ask the questions . until then ... 
where 's your friend ? he go with the chiquita ? 
no , and neither were my men . 
where 's scully ? ! 
if i break <number> you gon na shoot me ? 
no , you never listened . i was going , man , if someone on high had n't pulled me in . i had put all i had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down , there was a part of me that wanted to go with him . 
you 're doing it , <person> . you 're saving this town . 
now look , this is the last time you come to me with any such stories â€” i 'm sick of this sort of thing . 
oh -- please - do n't let me interrupt finish your phone call . 
smythe ! i mean - when you 're alone and want to amuse yourself , then what ? 
oh , they 'll stop , all right . it 's a matter of knowing how to hail them . 
in detroit . this weekend . 
oh , shut up . 
out the window ! something just flew by ! 
you 're a real heathen , you know that , <person> ? <person> , how did i ever get involved with such a ninny ? 
i hope so . 
gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory ? 
you meant it . 
there's-there's-there's-there 's <person> when-in-the-pink , <person> <person> <person> , there , you know ? he 's the latest ! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night . he placed third . 
clarence odbody , a-s-2 . 
does n't surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that . 
yes . enough energy to hide a ship , would n't you say ? 
no , seriously , if you 're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot , they give you free shit . 
obviously , for precrime to function , there ca n't be any suggestion of fallibility . after all , what good is a justice system that instills doubt ? it may be reasonable , but it 's still doubt . 
tear down all the fences . why , if you tore <number> picket off of your neighbor 's fence he 'd sue you ! 
look , asshole , i 'm right ! somebody 's a fuckin ' rat . how many times do i hafta say it before it sinks in your skull ? 
with all my heart . 
oh , you know what . i 'm suffocating ! 
do n't have to ... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss . 
aw , hey now , that was a compliment . 
just about.. 
greed . it was written in blood . 
a blindfold , cigarette , noseplugs ? just kidding . 
compute ! 
in case things get too intense . it automatically freezes the game , gives you a breather . things can get pretty wild ... 
why did n't you tell me ? 
oh yes , i do . 
take it easy , <person> . 
that means under a year . let me explain what <number> years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic . there are no conspiracies , no grand mysteries , and no evil puppet masters behind it all , pulling the strings ; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it does n't always make sense but it 's always neat . <person> 's our guy . 
<number> years ago . november . 
a jockey ? you mean , like -- 
look at this , all of a sudden everybody 's a fuckin ' <person> around here . did you see the way she was lookin ' at him ? 
do n't mess with me . how much ? 
yes . like i was putting them into my big basket . clearing the hillside of its children . 
long as we 're on the subject of perverts . . . i miss <person> . <person> 's spring him . 
oh . 
sir . 
not as bad as what they 're doing to kitty . 
maybe we can get a throw phone in there . 
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ? 
all that i 'm saying ... 
i stand for something . and i 'm trying to communicate something . 
ayuh ... how is your cat , <person> ? 
i 'm no expert , but i 'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused -- 
in the water . 
are they on the phone still ? 
<person> <person> turned up yet ? 
mio fratello . 
give him the card . 
you 've had it . i 'm gon na get you . 
why should we care ? 
here , <person> . 
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ... 
by killing them ? 
he wo n't . he thinks i 'm simple . 
that 's where they keep the criminally insane , is n't it ? 
why ? they 're only noodles . 
well , there 's the stardust ballroom . that 's a kind of a big dance hall . every saturday night , it 's just loaded with girls . it 's a nice place to go . you pay seventy-seven cents . it used to be seventy-seven cents . it must be about a buck and half now . and you go in and you ask some girl to dance . that 's how i met virginia . nice , respectable place to meet girls . you tell <person> , <person> <person> , you tell him , `` go to the stardust ballroom . it 's loaded with tomatoes . '' 
thank you , it 's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you , you fucker . 
i live . in the same country . 
why was he on <person> <person> ? 
jesus christ ! 
there are ads ? for parents ? 
it 's not what you think . darn it . i 'm going out on a story . the secretary of defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid 's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he 'd rather duck . 
showed them the photo , showed them the goddamn <person> , big as life . they did n't see it . not like me . not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture ... he 's out there , somewhere ... i shot off my gun , shot off my big mouth , so they fired me ... . 
that she was unconscious , yes ! so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the ... 
if there was any way out ... 
he just saved us <number> <number> thousand bucks . 
well , he certainly is n't acting like it . 
separately , we are flawed and vulnerable . but together , we are the masters of our sexual destiny ! 
no thanks ? what does that mean ? means you ate before you came down here ? all full . is that it ? naw , i do n't think so . i think you 're too scared to be eatin ' . now , see we 're sittin ' down here , ready to negotiate , and you 've already given up your shit . i 'm still a mystery to you . but i know exactly where your ass is comin ' from . see , if i asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down , i 'd say to myself , `` this motherfucker 's carryin ' on like he ai n't got a care in the world . who know ? maybe he do n't . maybe this fool 's such a bad motherfucker , he do n't got to worry about nothin ' , he just sit down , eat my chinese , watch my tv . '' see ? you ai n't even sat down yet . on that tv there , since you been in the room , is a woman with her titties hangin ' out , and you ai n't even bothered to look . you just been starin ' at me . now , i know i 'm pretty , but i ai n't as pretty as a couple of titties . 
right . i 'm going to get in closer to <number> of these big ones ... 
i detest violence , but ... christmas complacency can be a downer , too . 
thanks <person> . it 'd be so embarrassing 
what do you mean ? 
i do n't know . i do n't know . 
you so do not deserve to be prom queen . 
i do n't know , sir . i do n't follow political issues much . 
i stand corrected . <person> . you 're an oak . 
i 'll tell you , <person> -- i 've been away for a long time . very far away . 
here 's what 's going to happen . <person> , we need to find a guy in gillette 's bank . <person> , we need papers , corporate , insurance ... 
well , it 's true , is n't it ? after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else . what do you think ? 
thank god ! 
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing -- 
i can kill a hundred ordinary people . 
i know where it is . 
look ... at some point we 're going to have to call the vice president ... 
listen to yourself . why would i do anything like what you 're describing ? 
right . right . 
i was wondering , if you 're not doing anything tonight ... would you like to go to dinner ? i know ; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the oasisburg citizen -- but nevertheless , would you ? 
there 's still nobody in the world who can play `` as time goes by '' like <person> . 
lem me guess where you got that from . tell me somethin ' , what 'd you ever see in that guy anyway ? 
why , what did he do ? 
maybe next time . 
yes . and i 've accepted . 
<number> feet . we got ta go , man . <number> feet , we got ta go ! 
you just became a statistic ! 
want a drink ? 
eat shit ... . 
i do n't know . i think it 's a piano ... .a small piano . 
probably not . 
ca n't do it . 
boss , we better roll if we 're going to hit this place , blow it up , and make that flight.. 
what if he < u > is < /u > working for someone else ? what if he turned ? 
just go ! 
it 's not a business . <person> . it 's a vocation . 
and break her heart and mine ? 
no matter what happens ... you 're innocent ... i promise ... 
magic . 
i understand . 
depraved ? my mistake . 
sure . look ! you sing it over again , and i 'll do `` humoresque '' with you . 
to repress <number> 's feelings only makes them stronger . 
i ... i ... 
then it 's god , right ? 
i 'm not hiding in my work , if that 's what you 're saying . 
look , <person> , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the ao-units , and with your test gear . 
did n't know you 'd be bringin ' a friend . well , he 'll have to wait his turn - 
i 'm thinkin ' maybe i could let it go ... 
probably not . no . why ? 
hablar slowly , por favor . my ingles no es bien . 
you talked about it ? 
and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this ... ... point here , captain . it should pick up even a tricorder playback . 
yeah ... i think so . 
you lost that <number> ? 
should i wait up ? we 've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow . 
aye , <person> <person> , come to serenade you , <person> ... come to make you dance . 
we 've got the tape to prove it . 
at thy good heart 's oppression . 
why ? 
retiring . 
he 's not finished . 
of course . i 'm not a monster . 
<person> b. did for me what i did for you last night , <person> . only i was n't alone when <person> came back . 
it happened once . with me , that 's making a habit of it . 
speak of the devil ! ... 
why do you want to have a child with me ? you ca n't stand me . 
it 's haunted just the same . 
nick , you ca n't do this . 
do it ! 
yeah , but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in <number> at grover 's <person> , new jersey ... 
<person> reynolds . 
we have a lot of work to do . 
over the line , smokey ! i 'm sorry . that 's a foul . 
picking up magnetic interference . 
ma ! stop ! what do you want me to do ? 
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets , beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty ... what ? there is a strike in the kitchen ? good ! will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause . i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables ... what ? you wo n't serve me either ? now look here , comrade , i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you 're weakening the people . 
thanks . 
kiki -- he wo n't hurt you . there 's nothing to be afraid of . 
yes , and my giraffe loves it , too ... 
too much school . 
i ca n't imagine why . 
checking out a theory . just keep talking to him . 
you must decide . you might get tired of this life . you might begin to miss your family . if it were our daughter , we 'd look for her too . she would miss us . jen ... i want you to be mine forever . i will make my mark on the world . i will earn your parents ' respect . we have a legend . anyone who dares to jump from the mountain , <person> will grant his wish . <person> ago , a young man 's parents were ill , so he jumped . he did n't die . he was n't even hurt . he floated away , far away , never to return . he knew his wish had come true . if you believe , it will happen . the elders say , `` a faithful heart makes wishes come true . '' 
are you a rotten liar . 
so , you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country , <person> ? 
how about law and order ? you have no soldiers or police ? 
it 's bad news when you ca n't even bribe kids . 
mookie , i do n't know what you 're talking about , plus i do n't want to hear it . 
who cares ? 
jordan . might we do this over lunch tomorrow ? i do very much want to talk , but now is scarcely -- 
merle , i wan na go home ! 
i think it 's the universal greeting when you do n't like someone . 
w'sup , <person> ? 
just put it down . 
yeah . 
i do n't think so . are you coming , <person> ? 
my real father ? well , he was a flashback . 
capture them ? well , i 've never seen anything like it , so ... of course i 'm curious . 
yeah , right . 
she did like you , she helped and trusted you ! you paid her back by trying to take <person> away ! 
<person> <person> ! 
forced spice evolution of humans changes many things ... . i must sit close to him . 
what percentages for my family ? 
you 's the novelty , <person> ! 
<person> said shit , <person> -- 
i love you too ... too late ... too late ... 
you can stop it right now . 
the monitors are failing . 
i 'm okay . 
no , he 's not dead ! he lives in baldwin hills . i met him recently , and he wants to be in our picture . 
start him out on cottage cheese . if you 've got him on kibble , just soak it a few minutes . go down like pudding through a hot pipe . 
i ai n't nobody 's father ! 
<number> night is no betrayal . have pity on me . <person> , i beg you , do not refuse me . you do not know the price . 
in a fight ? 
what would he be doing down there ? 
imagine ... i 'm sleepin ' with a dt . 
it 's just an outward symbol of everything that 's inwardly wrong in this town . not bad , huh ? i read sherwood anderson in college . i can jive that shit all day . 
yeah , i guess . 
who ? someone famous ? 
'a connecticut yankee in king <person> 's court ' by <person> <person> . 
i do n't see anything . 
so you were n't interested in music at all ? 
but , will you ? 
no , you talkin ' at me . 
no ! 
no . 
so you 're going to stop acting ?

with <number> of them , i did n't use any kind of protection . <person> , maybe it was <number> .

easy , chief . i ... i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all . 
not at all . but on the other hand , i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at <number> end while i sit at the other . that is precisely the point of a long dining table . the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it . 
<person> god . the ones that found the pig hair in the french fries ? 
hey , i 'm a police officer , remember ? 
maybe you 're right . 
still , i wish i could remember . but , i guess it does n't matter anyway . we know each other now , do n't we ?

because he drove <person> insane -- deliberately -- coldly ! 
yeah . 
they probably stopped off somewhere . have her call me when she gets back . i 've got <person> here and i want to know what time to put her to bed . 
which way did she fall ? 
goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people 's eyes . there 's got ta be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened . 
is this the protective male talk ? 
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims : `` i went live last month . '' 
let the boy finish the game , <person> . 
it 's ... basalt . <person> . 
can i see you tomorrow ? 
you know you could at least have the decency of telling me who 's badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face . how do you know it 's not some girl who 's pissed off at me for breaking up with her ? 
you trying to tell me how to run my own business ? 
excellent . 
you better get some sleep , alright ? 
fuck ! ! ! that is so bullshit ! 
okay , baby . now you outfitted . you ready to tackle the street ? 
-- i 'm sure you did . 
the place we 're going is on the other side of that . 
i do n't tell her a thing . 
love him ... yes , it is true . that 's the hard part for me ... i knew him better than anyone ... i knew him best . 
ever durned <number> . 
he 's around someplace . 
she was hot . 
he was having some fun . yeah , well he 's dead . come on , let 's go in . 
getting your hair done ... would you like to go to a party ? 
no . these are her first steps . watch her . 
what will you do , colonel ? 
well not exactly , no ; i got 'em sitting in the car , actually ; i thought we might sell them back to the greek , but i am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him . 
pity your mother came , too ... 
even your play . 
it 's far too late for him to still be out . 
i 'm not mad at you . 
we go underwater ? 
it was . i could n't have you go away , wherever it is ... to war ... without knowing something . you think i made a choice , of <person> over you . i did n't . i did n't have a choice . i 'm pregnant . 
this is the staircase of the palace . 
so we want to change-up the mission statement . 
but what became of your lamb ? clarice ... ? 
like this ? look at me ! like this ? 
i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman . 
let 's go to detroit . 
we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town . 
from <number> to '89 . 
what the hell are you saying ?

professor , if something does go wrong tonight ... if i do n't get my parents back together ... when do you think i 'd cease to exist ? 
will you let me explain ! 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
i do n't know . probably have a copy of my birth certificate ... my apartment . 
sure , all drifters do . 
me ? 
the kind we 've been talking about . can you answer me now ? 
is that good or bad ? 
he almost always killed strangers . spent years moving on from <number> place to another . that made it real hard to track him down . 
i 'll keep in contact . you have the bridge . 
did she ever see <person> ? 
so <person> makes a deal with the feds to trade up for his brother ? 
you what ? 
maybe you do n't see my sign ? 
the rest meant nothing to me . 
hi , lydia . 
what kind of information ? 
yes . you see , rich people need someone to keep the crowds away . the world 's full of pests . then there 's the newspapers to handle . <number> must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it . 
last night was the worst . i dreamt you had <number> leg shorter than the other , and walked like a penguin . 
you know you can always talk to me . <person> ? whatever is going on in your life , your mom and i 'll understand .

give me some time to recall the data on our computers -- 
no . 
no calls from inside out . no calls from outside in are even answered . no calls . 
surgically attached . 
they dig for the gems to support our cause . they also search for the last <number> stones . soon we will have all <number> <person> <person> and the thuggees will be all powerful ! 
yeah . <person> murdered them and ... 
dignan , he 's my brother . i ca n't just leave him there . 
it 's <number> of a kind .

that 's awful . 
here , <person> . 
we wo n't have to . the run is tomorrow night . 
your doorbell does n't work . 
-- you do n't understand : it 's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills are n't working , he 's -- past <number> days it 's like he ca n't really swallow them and i do n't know if they 're going down -- i ca n't see inside his mouth anymore -- i 'm up all night staring at him and i do n't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --

that 's a scientific impossibility , you know . <person> uncertainty principle . whatever you study , you also change . 
then try talking to my lawyer . good evening , gentlemen . 
where 'd you get the blood ? 
-- i guess you have n't . 
i do n't believe you . 
but you would not stay with me . 
but you knew about this . 
sometimes it 's worse to stay than it is to run . 
you always did have more balls than brains . 
believe you 're right . 
did you know he 's already got a bad knee ? in another <number> years you 're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair . 
i feel -- fidgety , ma -- not right at all .

you ca n't prove a rumor . that 's why it 's a rumor . 
the loser ran off alone . the winner followed those footprints toward <person> ! 
i 'm sorry ... 
no , not really . they 're about the same . my marriage was <number> long headache . 
are you sure she do n't know about the money ? 
exactly . it 's time to make decisions .

ellie , there is no reason you have to be alone . 
i 'm not joking . i had to face up to all my competitive drives , and believe me , i 've got 'em . 
what do you get ? 
what ? why 'd you do that ? 
we have a bible study meeting tonight if you 'd like to come .

but it 's ten-thirty at night .

thank you . 
i think you 're right . so come on , i came all the way over here to find out what got <person> so spooked , tell me what happened . 
free ? 
i told <person> that he would answer with his life for any looting . 
now we just got ta figure out how to get there . 
i think i can handle <person> <person> by myself . 
you better not leave that cadillac sitting out here .

if i thought i 'd offended her , of all people- 
in charge . <person> me'n him . no interference . they do n't even want to hear from us until we 're done . i love the f.b.i . i love the f.b.i . 
i do n't my plans myself . 
sorry ... 
i 'm okay here . why bother ? 
what would it mean , anyway ? if he did n't write it ? 
here 's to <person> . 
i 'm not going to get up an ' leave you . now let 's go over to el 's an ' have a good time . 
by the way , how is your father 's side ? 
at pÃ¨re mathieu 's . 
that son of a bitch . 
<number> years , <person> . <number> years . i just want to go home . 
yeah , snifters are for cognac -- 
give me a minute . i 'll be right down . 
huh ? 
oh yes , more than enough . 
take him ? now wait ... i did n't take him anywhere . we were just having some fun . we did n't hurt him ... just having a laugh , that 's all . 
are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony ? 
the boots and socks in gardena . when we got there , i met <person> and a guy named <person> <person> . it 's a phony name . my name 's <person> <person> . 
there are maidens as fair , and fairer than guenevere . if i put my mind to it , i could see them now , many of them , weeping for love of you , watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles . offering you their every favor . <person> , clever -- but if it is to be <person> , so be it . 
yeah . 
no . <person> did . 
yes . 
they 're sayin ' that nobody 's gon na talk to you cuz they do n't give away <number> of their own . but they did say there 's somebody way across the little walking river who wants to talk to you . 
she is n't here . and i 'm sorry , but <person> <person> does n't want her to have callers during working hours . 
i ca n't find you . 
relax . there , that 's better . let yourself slip into the role . 
ok ... 
i see . you 're not just another pretty face.. 
but ... they 're odd-looking . they 're for milk . your mum 's got them . you must have seen a thousand of them -- what 's the fuss about ? 
we play hide and seek all the time . they find a lot of things . 
tell me again . 
really ? 
really , i have n't a bit of character . none at all . 
<person> lipnik , i really would feel much better if you could reconsider â€“ 
who 's the cheapskate ? 
my philosophy is if you do n't have a sense of humor , you 're better off dead . 
then why did you run away ? 
how much did ya lose ? 
only on a much grander scale . 
i 'm ... not ... a ... killer . 
let 's not start all over again , <person> . we 've said everything that can be said . 
did you ever think that maybe neither of us is <person> <person> ? 
no , i do n't think so ... wait . they 're not but ... something is . oh my god . 
the ones that 've been raising the devil with my fishing boats . 
that depends . you either do your job or get ethical . 
well , there was uh , a little dissent about the amount of the bonus -- 
let me ask you something ... you really think i 'm going to come this close , this fucking close and let my guard down ? i 'll get square with your boss . i 'll get square with whoever did <person> . i 'll get square with everybody . then i 'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here . 
get outta here . 
i 'm not talking about dollars , studmuffin . i 'm talking about -- 
listen , <person> took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you 're going . 
you think ? 
i was born in new york city . i grew up . and here i am . 
it 's a thought . 
they 're already watching you . if they had to , they 'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout . he 'd wake up not even remembering his `` act of revenge . '' 
right . 
first a nerd and then a weirdo . what a bunch of nose pickers . i 'll tell <person> . 
oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk ! 
no . 
nothing . 
what kept you ? 
yeah , enormous . 
if something should happen to us , the navy will at least have partial records of what happened . 
let me go . 
he knows better . 
who are you anyway ? what the hell is this ? 
i will not yield , sir ! this same man -- <person> <person> -- came here to offer me a place in this senate for twenty years , if i would vote for a dam that he knew and *i* knew was a *fraud* ! but if i opened my mouth against it , he promised to break me in <number> ! and i stood here <number> day and tried -- i *started* to open my mouth -- and it all came to pass . the long , powerful arm of <person> <person> <person> reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck -- 
i know and i 'm honored ... 
is n't she ? 
<number> of the printers . 
very good . the last mass trials were a great success . there are going to be fewer but better russians . 
you know , <person> <person> . `` oh , <person> '' . `` camptown races '' , stephen-stinkin'-foster ! 
who pays for them ? 
what makes you so sure ? 
the size of this is ... beyond me . testify ? 
a black man playing big league ball is something . 
that'sâ€” 
without grendel knowing about it . b-i-n-g-o and <person> was his name-o . counterfeit c.d.s . <person> piracy has graduated to disc piracy , the sound quality 's better , and so 's the money . 
she 's cool . 
you 'll ask me to what ? 
if you 're trying to push my buttons , you 're on the right track . do n't make me question my own judgment , x . 
run and get something to mop it up with , quickly . 
let him find out on his own . i want the hong kong police handling this . 
too-do-loo , babe . 
you do n't have to twist my arm . say now , that gumbo has quite a kick . 
casualties ? 
but that does n't solve the problem . who is doing this ? and why ? 
i want his name . 
what about the money ? uh , where 's the box ? 
i do n't want to see any goddamn pictures . 
i killed him ? ? ? 
i do n't know ! ! 
thank you . 
get off the grift , <person> . 
please , <person> . 
you know ... i like you people ... i really do . 
no wonder he did n't want to mention her name . 
are they paying you for all this ? 
-- i work for the city . 
its horrors , perhaps ! its darkest nightmares ! and to what end ? nothing but your own morbid gratification -- 
the nite owl ! <person> was going there to sell the heroin . 
well , actually , uh -- i 'm sort of making it up -- 
stop ! 
away from the piano , <person> , you have no sense of time at all . 
oh really . then why is he called jake . why do n't you come clean and call him jack . there 's no hope in it . 
i thought i saw a black widow spider . 
i do n't think so . 
this ... seemed best . 
oh , i 'm sorry , i must have made a mistake . 
do exactly what i say . 
a turkish brothel . 
listen to me you sorry sonufabitch . you owe me money , and this car ai n't going nowheres until i get it . and if you take another <number> hours i 'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it . is that clear ? now get out of here 'fore i call the sheriff , < u > who knows me < /u > . 
in time . 
no . most of them are in transit by now . i 'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security . 
what the hell are you doing , <person> ? screwing with the cia ? i do n't care how much he wants -- pay him . 
it 's 'pose to be cold . 
no , i have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing . 
well , what 's wrong , boy ? <person> got your tongue . 
time . 
it 's also been a long time for me . i -- 
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin . i got to have trust . 
you dying . 
she asked me to come over . she said she had something to tell me . 
i 'm askin ' ya to go to him -- as a favor . 
why do n't you try to sleep now , mrs. brenner . 
now we 're back on track . 
captain . 
you work in a market , all right . 
well ... small world . well , then , you know firsthand how <person> does things . lights all over the place , generators , a <number> and fifty crew members -- - 
how 's the ankle ? can you put your weight on it ? 
the scent you 're wearing . i bought it for you , not <person> . the thing about <person> . so many things . the day he was late back from rome -- i tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl . i 'm not talking about <person> , another girl we met in a bar . he could n't be faithful for <number> minutes . so when he makes a promise it does n't mean what it means when you make a promise . or i do . he has so many realities , dickie , and he believes them all . he lies . he lies , that 's his ... half the time he does n't even realize . 
have you ever bent your knees , <person> ? 
yes -- that 's right . production for use . 
did you give her a jump ? if you did i might begin to understand where your head 's at . 
i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up . 
hunh ? 
when does he graduate high school ? 
the other <number> like you ... 
my pleasure -- 
thanks . are you officer <number> ? 
about <number> <number> of your miles . 
do you know where we can find him ? 
<person> <person> ? i 'm trying to reach <person> <person> . 
aw , come on <person> . we 've gotten all we 're gon na get out of this place and its starting to rain . 
i ca n't believe it - he actually scored ! 
but ... 
you better quit pushing me , pal . 
why the interest ? 
oh , like i could do that ? 
i see . i 'm sorry about this , <person> . i 'm not happy about this situation . it 's bad . you now know who your brutus is . 
it 's a tax write off for <person> <person> mccay . 
i 'm afraid i 'm not able to tell you much . only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a <person> <person> <person> with whom we do considerable business . 
give him the tampon test . 
that plane might 've been to throw us off the track . remember the bait-and-switch <person> pulled with the eskimo and his truck ? 
really ? um ... i ... well ... you 're really turning me around here , 
return to prearranged coordinates for pickup . 
okay , yeah . i did something naughty ... there 's this amazing comix store in seattle . to tell you the truth , i did it once or twice at stanford . 'guess i ca n't keep anything from you ... 
the best interference runner we 've got . he thinks he 's in love with you -- and he 's a gentleman . come here , baby . 
oh yeah ? have you seen any ? 
nothing . do nothing . do n't get between us . 
rush your mouth , girl . no , he did n't . he can not be that big of a damn fool . 
ruins . not rocks . the remains of trondham abbey . <person> on an intersection of <person> <person> , the boundaries between our world and the other -- 
we 're the ones doing the death- defying shit ? and he wants us to give that up ? for what ? a chump-change bust so he can get his picture in < i > the miami herald < /i > to impress the slug farm in dc ... 
i do . 
daddy ? 
uh-huh 
did you ask <person> ? 
coulda been a contender . 
sometimes my food , and my clothes , and my underwear . 
are you sure it 's all right for us to be here ? 
did you think it was going to be easy ? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet ? 
honey , ahh , guys do n't wan na appear over anxious , so if you think there 's a boy that might like you , let him know that you like him , so he wo n't feel he 's taking such a risk when he 's thinking of asking you out . 
talk what out ? we are locked and loaded here . we are non-refundable . i 've got relatives on the airport right now ! i 've got ... 
okay , sure , <person> . 
<person> <person> . very moving . `` turning and turning in the widening gyre / the falcon can not hear the falconer / things fall apart , the center can not hold / mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / the best lack all conviction , while the worst are full of passionate intensity '' ... but it ends so beautifully ominous -- `` what rough beast , its hours come round at last / slouches toward bethlehem to be born ? '' ... yes , this country stands at such a juncture . 
well , look . how 's this ? you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr. st. luc ... ... you tell him that <person> 's ill , he 's got these lumps , and he ca n't get out of bed . tell him to come when you 're sure <person> 'll be home . and do n't tell <person> anything . let the <number> of them fight it out . 
i would if i could find it . it 's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range . meanwhile ... 
that 's strange . i 'm nervous . <person> 's nervous . everyone 's nervous . but not you ... 
what kind of message ? 
plus , you could use that commission . 
yes ? 
if <person> thinks you 're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister , he 's gon na tap dance on your spleen . 
i 'm going to leave now . 
no . 
why would he ? his parents are rich . 
you been a bad girl , <person> . you took my heart from your mama , did n't ya ? you betrayed her ! like you did me . there ai n't no forgivin ' ya , girl ! 
ah-ha . favouritism . but i so want mozart . 
but like only up to the part about the raft , because i did n't read any farther . 
makes you feel good ? putting what you know to use ? 
you 'll whip me ! 
and when i return ... you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect ! 
really ? you 're such a talented actor . 
thank you ... <person> <person> . 
how old are you ? 
i 'll say it again , all right ? you told <person> . he told me . i know what happened . yes ? yes ? 
good . then pour the wine . 
leon could still have hung himself . 
but they have . 
you fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day ? the union ai n't gon na like it . 
he was only doing what he thought was right . 
no , no . do n't leave me ! 
yes . i do n't know what else to do -- with him following us . why do you keep running from your -- 
no , i 'm not , <person> is , honest . or what about <person> ? or that little guy with the glasses ? 
you ca n't remember that -- ! 
'snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial . lock them all away forever . no political risk , and big publicity . ' that 's what he said . i thought i 'd better tell you . 
told you not to call your mama . 
we have n't seen you since ... i 'm terribly sorry . 
yes . i mean the real mccoy . <person> , you play saloon with me , and i 'll introduce you to every wit , every nit-wit , and every half-wit in new york . we 'll go on a twister that 'll make omar the soused philosopher of persia [ <number> ] look like an anemic on a goat 's milk diet . 
it 's the only way we can make enough to put ho-jon through <person> . 
voices from an old dark house ! 
get your fucking hands off me ! what the hell is going on here ? 
huh . 
and you know this for a fact ? 
what would they say ? `` <number> miles to big rock . '' `` twenty miles to bigger rock . '' 
<person> , when we build up our tax base a little , you can have every- thing you want ; right now , the town 's broke . 
and where do you place <person> ? 
actually , that 's why i stopped by . he 's realy sorry , he wanted to make it , but then he ... ran into a problem . 
you know as much about it as i do . i have n't seen him in <number> months . 
let me try mine . 
my co-counsel , <person> <person> , and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness . if you 'd be interested in talking to us , we 'd certainly like to talk to you ... 
nah , it probably wo n't turn up anything . i 'm just gon na talk to him . 
dirty business we 're in sometimes . 
i wish i knew . 
you are in the cage , o'neil . <person> here , right now . 
we do n't need a warrant if it 's a riot . 
she starts sniffing me . 
remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code . i 'm sure you 're going to be very happy there . 
it was c ... i do n't know , sixteen or seventeen , <number> of those . why ? you looking for anyway , a bomb or something ? 
naw . 
explain noises . 
correct me if i am wrong ... we are facing north , are n't we ? 
there 's no one here . 
sid , cut the crap . i -- 
listen , at least it 's warm in here . 
you mean taking bribes , and skimming busts and letting hoods walk ? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest <person> ? 
what ! 
you want the title shot or not ? 
i was chosen because i was the bravest and the most worthy . the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat . i pass it to you who vanquished me . 
save it for the jury . i hope sid pulls your voice-box out , ya creep ! 
do n't worry . i 'm gon na take care-a the whole thing . 
you 're setting me up for a double cross , you with the ship , and me with nothing more than your word ! 
i have something , so much -- i 'm sick , claudia . i 'm sick . 
careful , lad . 
groom . 
no , i never . i would not do that , <person> . never . 
ellie ... this is the way it 's been done for billions of years ... 
okay . 
no beer ? 
good move : when all is said and done , she 's nothing special . i saw her taking her pants off and i definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there . 
alright ? 
that 's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking . never shut up . 
hi . 
of course , the landlady is going to lock us out - <person> said no more knackwurst on credit - and we ca n't borrow any more from the girls , because they 're on their way to jail - 
my favorite little cousin . 
listen . you people go grab a table . i 'll be back inna minute . i 'll be right back . 
what do you think ? you think he 's been picking flowers ? <person> ' guy 's been saving your ass , <person> . everybody 's ass ! even in europe ! 
you got to tell em that you saw the accident . do n't you ? 
yeah . <number> months we 've been fishin ' this river together . we use the same equipment , more or less ... 
thanks . 
you 're kidding . 
because what i am interested in is right here ... 
this better be worth <number> . 
they 're stupendously successful . you ca n't get a seat . the only problem is none will hire me . they all want to hear me play , but they wo n't let me teach their daughters . as if i was some kind of fiend . i 'm not a fiend ! 
yes , darling . 
correct . 
on the contrary , you 're not strange . and that in itself is confusing . i have the same idea about shangri- la . the sense that i 've been here before , that i belong here . 
the knife slices into <person> again ... then again . the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife . a horrifying , sickening sight . 
buck is a deal . 
who do you think did it ? 
you know , it 's just possible that she has n't read this yet . 
eta with target ; <number> minutes . 
thirty feet ? ? ? 
yeah , <person> , are you gon na get home okay ? 
i 'm not a traitor . i 've served my ountry . 
susan . what are you doing ? 
i 'm not interested , <person> . you 're no longer on this assignment . 
i *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future ! 
i ca n't see why you did , unless ... you did n't have to marry him or anything , did you ? 
look , just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes ... whatever ... do n't make a joke of your life . go back and read what you wrote . you 're better than the rest of them , better than the <person> <person> , and do n't forget it . 
it was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ? 
i have to face facts . i-i adore alvy , but our relationship does n't seem to work anymore . 
there 's <number> or <number> freaks , and , for a `` < u > pass < /u > , '' i 'll rat them out to you ... 
you asked for it . 
that 's 'cause i < u > was n't < /u > there . 
want you to do something , fergus . 
no ! no ! 
must be the way their weight is distributed . come on . 
<person> walker -- i did n't expect anyone â€”â€” 
why -- i -- er thought with all this heat turned on i 'd hide it . 
who ? 
do n't be a fool . <number> ca n't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl 's body is in your hand , you 'll do as i say . as for me , i 'll tend to gray . 
<person> told me . 
pankot is n't on the way to delhi . 
we sell it . i got it all figured out . we make <number> finger lids and sell them on the beach . we move all of it . we 've made ourselves a hundred bucks . or a lot of weed for our head . what do you think ? not bad , huh ? i got the baggies and everything . 
yes ... yes . i think i will ... 
look , <person> , i think i 've found the dress . 
you can have your servants prepare a dinner . that is the way i 'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- death -- i have fought him before . i 've won often . now he wins . let him come for me at my own banquet . 
they got ta be . 
fight it . 
but i could n't r'member all the words . ast them would they gim me a second chance . 
would you -- could you see your way to cuttin ' off <number> cents worth ? 
is that the same standard you used to choose general formica ? 
that 's right . you 're so lost you do n't even know how you like your eggs . 
do n't do that ! ! 
to be indoors on such a day . it 's crime . 
no , you wait right there for me ... i 'll be on the piedmont flight tomorrow at <number> . meet me at the airport . 
it 's an anti-psychotic , the num ... the number ... hello ... hello ... 
yes you did . you been putting it up your whole life . you just did n't know it . you know what date is on this coin ? 
go ! 
i do n't trust anyone . you do n't get to the top of this game by trusting people ... and after all , you are a thief . it 's in your nature to steal . i 'm just protecting my investment . 
no police ! 
come on ! 
no , colonel kurtz could n't be crazy -- if you heard him talk , just last week , you 'd never think he was crazy . 
i 'm trying ! 
why not ? 
i 've finished for the evening . will you be needing anything else ? 
i needed some time away . 
so , your husband hired me to kill him . that 's the truth . 
why are they under there ? 
leave the pills . i 'll take them later . 
thieves . 
good . 
i do n't think you 're getting in the spirit of things , <person> . we 'll buy whatever studies we need -- 
covered . 
yes ... <person> <person> ... 
i 've been waiting a long time to hear you say that . 
you see , if you shoot pool with some employee here , you can come and borrow money . what does that get us ? a discontented , lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class . and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like <person> <person> stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas . now , i say . . . 
it is safer there . i will join you shortly . 
we 'll settle it tonight . 
is that what it means ? 
excuse me ? 
not interested . 
just come and get it ... right here ! 
a sawbuck ! 
whoever . the point is , prices are goin ' up , too . better get your little black book out , <person> . we got some business to talk about . 
oh , yes . <person> . you know - vassar , <person> <person> - we 're only doing this for a lark . 
the memory of who ? 
a bad day ! you wan na hear a bad day ? yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor . she had a minor heart attack . partial paralysis . but i do n't let myself get sad . no way . not me . it 's not good for the soul . 
<person> morrow , over there , for instance , just dashes them off . 
funny , i 've never been a talker . my wife was always getting on me about that . 'say what you feel , tell me what 's bothering you , you ve got to talk to me . ' i never would though . not really . 
slate it . 
oh , do yuh ? 
you oughta see upstairs . it 's a slaughterhouse . 
<person> , what if she kidnaps him . 
yeah , <number> years straight . 
it 's to make you < u > understand < /u > him , with understanding comes tolerance . too bad they do n't put proverbs in twinkies , my load would be lighter . 
you hear me , girl ? 
that is <number> of my priorities . 
but you was n't a preacher . a girl was just a girl to you . but to me they was holy vessels . i was savin ' their souls . i ast myself -- what *is* this call , the holy sperit ? maybe *that's* love . why , i love everybody so much i 'm fit to bust sometimes ! so maybe there ai n't no sin an ' there ai n't no virtue . there 's just what people do . some things folks do is nice , and some ai n't so nice . but that 's as far as any man 's got a right to say . 
we 're gon na get outta here , <person> -- <person> ? 
i would n't want that to be misunderstood : my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was , sadly , unable to afford tuition up there . but there were <number> wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes , and they 're names are : <person> , <person> and <person> among others . i was completely independent financially , and like i said : <number> <person> <person> a shit . so what we 're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that 's what most people respond to in `` <person> , '' and at the end of the day ? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it 's about finding what you can be in this world . defining it . controling it and saying : i will take what is mine . you just happen to get a blow job out of it , then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not ? he.he.he . 
then you took her upstairs and you raped her . 
i 'll go in right now and get that eye . 
<person> knocked you off your feet . you got bumped pretty good , actually . 
i can see it all ... the very day it began . <person> was lonely ; she was desperate for friendship . i remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring . that must have been the day she first wished for a friend . 
someone will come . 
no , i like gettin ' up around <number> a.m. and talkin ' bout wild animals ... though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream . i kinda wish i did n't remember it . up at pee dee , i could n't remember any of my dreams . 
then we 'll leave it up to the courts -- his word against mine . what does his father do again ? steelworker ? does n't matter , i 'm sure justice will be served . in any case , my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions , these accusations on his son . he 's quite protective . 
-- well it was very hot so i 'd left the door open and the water was running so i did n't hear him come down the stairs ... 
right . <person> is the whole < u > point < /u > of this 'going out ' thing , so <number> of them can dump the other <number> , and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy , without ever having to actually date . 
yes . 
i do n't trust a man who do n't dance . it ai n't natural . 
i would 've paid more . i wanted to know everything about you . then you came down here after <person> got killed ... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better . 
i think he 'll be in bartlett 's <number> day . 
do n't get technical at a time like this ! do you realize what you 've done ? you 've taken a city that 's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you 're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new york 's having under <person> <person> ! we 'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next tuesday that nobody 'll vote for them -- not even their wives ! 
she 's hormonal . <person> , june ? it 's just part of the whole process . 
you 're firin ' me ? 
you do what you want . you want to leave ... you want to go kill yourself ? 
that 's not even -- 
not you . 
they 're all the same . 
disappeared . his body was n't among the victims . 
... you know , there 's nothing you could say , that could < u > possibly < /u > make a difference , so , why do n't you just save your breath . 
it 's important . 
she 's been arrested . 
us . <person> us . 
thanks , but i 've got to be going . unfortunately , <person> , this is n't a social visit . 
everybody has a great body now . 
yes . 
that 's a franklin mint piece . <number> dollars . 
i 'm not just selling the script . i 'm selling me . demille always said i was his greatest star . 
that 's what i 'm counting on .

well then what are you trying to do- 
no idea . <person> . what are you going to do ? 
i 'm sorry . 
it 's not important . 
it 's stupid . 
i was working on the cataloging . 
i do n't know . 
it 's deceptively simple . like a bruckner symphony or a matisse . 
pardon ? 
they 've been in there the longest kind of time . i ca n't stand it , i got ta find out what 's going on . 
they are n't expensive , you got them through your connections ... . speaking of which : 
what 's the difference ? i 'm going to write that story -- and you know it ! 
he 's <number> of the best chess players in the world . who better to play a game with ? 
you ca n't . i 'll get a hold of you . 
<person> ? are you all right ? 
that 's <number> , keep going ... 
i do n't know .

what 's the matter with you all ? have you lost your sense of humour ? 
okay , thank you . 
well , it must have takenâ€“ 
i 'm not . 
you 'd be surprised how often you see the same people , get the same fare . people have patterns . they do more or less the same things every day . i can tell . 
you 've lost interest ... you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex . 
i just think we oughta call this relationship quits ! 
we 're gon na get rid of him -- <person> , i mean -- just as fast as we can . he 's on the top of the list . 
the extreme always makes an impression , but you 're right , it was severe . did you say a cherry or <person> <person> ? 
ok. go ahead . 
it 's not my fault . i ca n't under- stand it ! 
it 's important . 
i ca n't fucking believe this guy . an apology , <person> ?

get that car the hell away from here , now ! i spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool . but this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off . 
no ... do n't hit me please ... 
why else would they approach us in this way ? it 's deniable . the soviets have done nothing but lie to us . this could be more of the same . 
no , you did n't . when ? 
where did you hear about this ? whose been talking about these things ? 
i get it . you 're the goon fetch boy . the zookeeper <person> calls in when <number> of his guinea pigs gets loose .

we 're all going . 
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools , anyway ? strap you down and pump the nature out of you ? they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck . why , send a shaman or cannibal to yale for <number> years and all he 'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy . <person> h.m.s . <person> ! if <person> or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters they 'd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps . <person> boogie .

hey , listen ! do you know what i think ? i ... 
how come ? 
you 're damn right i am . 
then remember , you are the heir to a <number> dollar empire . you have a staff of literally thousands . <person> everything you ever imagined by a <number> and you still ca n't even wrap your head around everything that is yours . all yours . 
a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer . i 'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing : plumbers , aluminum siders , roofers . 
it 's a foregone conclusion . for <person> 's sake , it 's eleven pm . the full moon is tonight . 
a daughter in oregon . 
<person> finch . her ex is <number> of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit . play your cards right and you could hit paydirt . she like 'em young . and since you look a little new at this , let me give you <number> words of advice . <person> to get . think it , act it , know it , be it . nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games . 
he took your wallet ? 
yeah ... 
c'mon . middle appendix -- 
<number> <number> thousand . no ... <number> <number> thousand . 
thanks <person> . say hi to <person> and ... 
okay . 
wonderful . when your next book is published , maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i 'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up . 
welcome to public school , my friend . 
what are what ? 
it 's safer if we stay together . 
maybe . but that 's how it works . 
if it 's any comfort to you , i do n't think you 're crazy . 
you 're the pathetic <number> , not me . 
still clear . 
just check whatever you were wearing last night . now ! 
the south . 
do n't say `` shit , '' honey . use the strong vocabulary god gave you . 
yeah , i do . a helluva lot more than i trust you . 
what are you doing ? 
what do you mean ? 
what ? 
he once made me an improper suggestion . 
rats ... 
<number> reasons . maybe fifteen . and also there 's something in it for me . 
you killed a prostitute . 
a guy dressed as <person> has been exposing himself to kids in los feliz . apparently , sir , he 's decorated himself . 
i do n't want to go to europe . i want to go to see the elephant man . 
we would be caught dead with men . those rough , hairy beasts with <number> hands - they all want just <number> thing from a girl . 
wait a minute . i just ... 
no . you 're just crazy about `` liebestraum . '' 
i 'm too old for you . 
i know your partner 's here , but it 's very important that you 're honest . 
what are you , my father ? 
over my dead body . 
good , let 's drink up . 
yeah ? 
tell him , will you tell him ? our instruments are okay . 
i do n't know -- maybe -- i do n't think so . 
i made that paella you liked . it 's on the stove . 
no . 
but we agreed your job is running the baby machine ... 
well , shit , you 're the cop , they do n't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you were n't supposed to kill her for <person> 's sake . 
look for it , mrs. lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can . you may not have a great deal of time . those men know you have it just as surely as we do . you wo n't be safe until the money 's in our hands . is that clear ? 
you got ta go with it . scary movies are great foreplay . 
and the last <number> ? 
i know what you want . but , first of all , are you cops ? 
to an artistic eye , you understand . have you ever modeled ? 
what do you listen to , <person> ? 
not pure evil . that 's correct . 
maybe i could talk to rigfort , you know , tell him the whole story . 
do n't shout at me , <person> . 
stay here . if we need you , we 'll know where to reach you . 
yes you can . you 're going to make it , scully . 
what 's that ? 
you got any money you want to bet on <person> <person> , you can put it right here ... 'cause <person> <person> do n't go down for nobody . 
want to tell me what went down here ? 
come on , <person> , this is good news . your mama 's gon na break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep . 
but why him ? 
no ! in vidalia ! <person> <person> <number> ! 
what is it , <person> ? 
come with me . i 'll tell you when we get there . 
good . making progress . 
<person> hinkley . the guy who shot <person> . he only had <number> names . 
it had a hole in the floor . where are we going ? 
yes , i would . 
no , <number> brothers of his were killed in action . command wants him out of there . 
and what do you possibly think you 're going to fucking see there ? 
he 'll play with his rifle , i expect . that will cheer him up . 
to be a `` piggy-backer '' it takes complete relaxationâ€”a warm heartâ€”and a loving nature . 
it was meatloaf . you just put everything in your soup . 
like the old days , dillon . 
oh , <person> , was this like an rsvp thing ? 
<person> harrison . 
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage ? 
'goddam party ' ! 
something stupid . 
no . i 'd want a public phone . 
okay , okay , okay , gim me this shit . <person> . 
we 've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag . you go get help . i 'm gon na stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor . 
no , it 's awful . oh my , it 's awful . 
-- who did he digitize ? ! 
first i got ta get the part , then i 'll worry about that . 
yeah . yeah , not bad . how 's your 's ? 
then , after that , what ? <person> 'little <person> ' <person> ; <person> <person> , maybe , <person> <person> himself , c'mon ! 
thanks . 
i 'll pop a benadryl . 
yeah , i do n't know . i simply ca n't get it to jell ! i created somebody who 's gon na give up his life for a principle , hundreds of thousands of people are gon na listen to him over the radio and , unless he says something that 's , well , that 's sensational , it 's just no good ! 
that 's a good question . 
they 're not going to hurt you . they 're encased in plastic . 
exactly . at least <number> of those animals had the brains to protect his ears . 
the truth is never gentle . listen to me carefully . each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams . <person> is the force that penetrates this wispy skin . it hurts and maims . 
huh ? 
what 's in it ? 
oh . where is this place ? 
<person> ? 
i do n't want to depend on these things , y'know -â€“ sometimes you can weaken your eyes . 
jazz . 
i promise . someday . when i 'm really supposed to . 
you have the worst flu since ... 
york just turned up outside . we 're trying to get him into infirmary . 
you 're my best friend . 
only the elders . 
`` for excellence in the pursuit of truth . '' 
please . i wo n't hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i do n't care . i just want to get out of here . 
there 's nothing wrong with ... that . 
why , thank you . 
it 's in the safe . she ca n't get at it . 
swear to god . 
what 's the goal , <person> ? my goal , <person> , is to just let it flow through me ? do you know what i mean ? it 's like , there 's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we 're all taught we should be consistent . y'know ? you love someone -- that 's it . forever . you choose to do something with your life -- that 's it , that 's what you do . it 's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through . and my feeling is that 's how you die , because you stop listening to what is true , and what is true is constantly changing . you know ? 
who prescribes the brandy ? 
yeah , baby , how 's it going ? 
i could hit her a little harder . more toward the cranium . 
i know that . 
frances , it 's me , <person> ? 
i suppose so . i can pick him up somewhere . 
do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses ? 
i 'll fix you some coffee . 
yeah , he 's probably been serving cocktails , so to speak , at the orgies . 
calm down , mrs. lampert -- please . does he have the money ? 
ashley . we 're not going anywhere i used to work . 
it 's the hair ! it 's to do with the hair . 
what happened to you ? 
we are not far ... ... our chairs almost touch . 
did you dress her up like this ? 
-- yeah , yeah , yeah . you just have your hundred grand ready . for that you get the machete ... the mask ... the whole damn thing . 
i 'm sure he 's matured since then . 
me neither . 
well ... seeing how you just suspended me , what 's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard , you old fart ? 
and we got rid of the red head . 
sit down . here . <person> here . <person> ! vince ! 
but if you 'll just give me ... 
why not ? you stink . 
yeah , i had my first taste on that trip to juarez . at that age you still got a lot of energy . 
i came out here with a dream . that 's gone , but i settled for reality . 
it 's silly of me to argue about it . i do n't know the people involved . 
my goodness , you ought to have a uniform . how much does <number> cost ? 
thing is , i 'm about out of fuel . 
yeah . it 's my sister 's . 
right . 
i just want to talk .

yours truly ... and he even has to write his full name ... <person> <person> ... not even just < <person> > <person> < /u > ! ... i do n't care if he < <person> > never < /u > comes back ! 
cash . 
a crucifix .

why do n't you talk to him now ? 
it 's okay . we need to talk . 
did i hurt you ? 
i never really ... went through a ... dating period . 
he even got my daddy 's watch . 
jack , are you really dead ? 
uh . `` thanks ? '' 
and if i stay ? 
you wo n't be lonely , <person> ... 
seriously . 
not if they 're looking at something else . 
i have n't been back for ten years . is your family still there ? 
she 's lying , norman . just like she lied about fixing your suit . 
there 's old saying my mother told me . would you like to hear it ? 
<person> treehorn draws a lot of water in this town , lebowski . you do n't draw shit . we got a nice quiet beach community here , and i aim to keep it nice and quiet . so let me make something plain . i do n't like you sucking around bothering our citizens , lebowski . i do n't like your jerk- off name , i do n't like your jerk-off face , i do n't like your jerk- off behavior , and i do n't like you , jerk- off -- do i make myself clear ? 
why ? 
i 'll see what i can do . 
you 're incorrigible ! 
really ? 
some other time . 
i do n't want to talk about it . i want you to go . 
hey . <person> . 
i would n't look too closely at the postmarks . 
i know it 's warm ... i wish you 'd call someone to check out the air conditioning , <person> . 
of course they 're gon na lose . we 'll watch them lose . what good is heartbreak if we do n't experience it firsthand ? 
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest . 
nurses .

<number> <person> ' ... 
lt. <person> , go .

miss her ? 
hello , <person> . i 'm just working . 
they certainly are . whatever it is we 're going to steal , it must be quite something . 
yeah , but ... 
really ? 
let 's go in . 
what is your name ? 
i 'll keep that in mind . 
so let 's say you get there ... what 's uh , third base feel like ? 
often . 
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power ? 
the rings ? 
you 'll get results <number> way or the other , that 's for sure ... okay . 
any time it 's saturday and i do n't hafta do any work , i 'm doin ' okay ! 
how am i going to break this to <person> <person> ? 
he 's in some trouble ...

i do n't want you to think that i 'm that way to you -- i 'm not gon na call you a slut or something -- 
he 's already angry , i do n't think -- 
yeah ? what did we ever do ? 
he 's got to ... all these years , run- nin ' , dodgin ' , knowin ' we were after him ... now we caught up ... it 's him or us . 
i ordered it . it 's for your own safety . 
if you enjoy it , you should do it . 
it 's for the best . 
i do . who is it ? the doctors . what do you owe them ? 
nick ! 
no , no . this is a man -- this man has a name ... 
well , hell , you got the whole chicago south side . how do ya expect the <number> lousy spots i 've got to compete with that ? 
well i never did it . 
neither do we . 
and i gave 'em directions out there , up by the old farm row ... i figured what 's the harm . stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit . 
of course . 
well , <person> & <person> 's , that 's closer ta <person> <person> , so i made that assumption . 
oh , yes ... well , that 's not so easy . beginnings are always difficult . 
drink your cappucino , you 're giving me a headache ... 
i always favored the hulk . 
thank you for seeing me . 
stopped by to see <person> . say hello . 
yes , me ! 
it 's not a rumor . it 's a sale . if <person> can unload cbs for $ <number> a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from <person> & <person> , that could screw up the sale , could it not ? 
and ? no . i do n't wan na know . what do you < u > mean < /u > `` and ... '' ? 
jesus . 
yes , but sons who would be professors , scientists , musicians ... and grandchildren who could be , who knows , a governor , a president even , nothing 's impossible here in america .

oh , <person> .

we just picked him up on the way in . he went away this mornin ' when the rate dropped . 
nevertheless what ' ? <person> will testify and that 'll be enough . 
just what you think i mean . 
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to upset you ... but you still did n't answer the question . 
maybe you should n't be working here so much . you do n't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life . 
that 's right , sir . and do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . what if they start something ? 
of course not ! am i acting as if ... something 's wrong ? 
now will you get out ? 
you are the same ? 
what does this have to do with.. ?

did the <number> of you talk ? 
i am aware of it , but it is beauty 's privilege . 
it 's <person> <person> . i 'm not answering it . 
so what 's it doing in tijuana ? 
like her speaking in a language that she 's never known or studied . 
yeah , he was probably drunker than my uncle , who fuckin ' knows ? so the cop goes `` stay here '' and he goes runnin ' down the highway to deal with the other crash . so , my uncle <person> 's standin ' on the side of the road for a little while , and he 's so fuckin ' lit , that he forgets what he 's waitin ' for . so he goes , `` fuck it . '' he gets in his car and drives home .

the king of england . i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there . 
the way you drove that car , i figured you for the streets . 
jack , if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches , then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that . so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace , when it 's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom . 
what happened ? 
no , not for that <number> . 
what ? 
we did <number> point <number> <number> in total revenue ...

the door was locked from your side . 
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized . there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg . the girl must have been taking a break between customers . it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there , loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and ... the reason i 'm telling you this epilogue is that i felt that i 'd come full circle . 
it 's not that i 'm drunk , i 'm just beginning to see what my mum was talking about . what was my mother like back in the sixties ? i 'm dying to know .

we thought maybe you 'd have that kind of information for us . 
i think that <person> wants me to go to this woman . she wrote a book about time travel . <person> asked me if i believed in time travel . that ca n't just be a random coincidence . my dad almost hit her with the car the other day , and she said the creepiest thing . she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone .

if we could cast it properly , that is ... 
i know her uncle . friends of the family . 
what did you say ? 
waiting 's hard . you never learn how . 
i do n't mean how 'd you do the paperwork , i mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it ?

yes , tonight . we 're going to be -- 
so you do have an agreement with the united states government , <person> <person> , correct ? 
if it was n't for me , you 'd be washing up on the beach at coney island right now . `` i need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good . '' 
<person> 's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he 's taking on first year interns . 
i do n't understand . 
<person> <person> ? it 's <person> . 
soon as i finish .

i do n't want to hear about it , okay ? that 's <number> jobs for the night . it 's over . <number> jobs and time for a drink . six am , the cocktail hour . pass the bottle ; i know you 're holding .

charge set . backing off . c'mon rover let 's get out of here . 
i 'm gon na tell you somethin ' , and it 's just gon na be between you and me . i think folks carry on about heaven too much . like it 's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds . and folks just gon na do as they 're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates . i can go to shoney 's for that . 
it did n't get there from me . 
i 'm sorry . really ... i am . 
let 's get away from the shore . 
i 'm still thinking about it . 
how many ? 
i 'm not paying you for the lovemaking , <person> . i just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer . 
talked to her this afternoon ... while you was out .

he 's lying through his ass ! 
catherine , do n't make an opera outta this . the three-a you anna baby live in <number> skinny rooms . you are an old goat , and she has an italian temper . she is a good girl , but you drive her crazy . <person> , you are no fool . you know this is no good , an old woman living with a husband and wife . <number> women inna same kitchen , anna house burns down . 
because . i know where he is . 
not too good . that 's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life , you 're in violation and are liable for the station 's financial losses . ed , i urge you to reconsider . i urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours . play fair with them , <person> . 
absolutely . 
< u > <person> < /u > ? reed , i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and i will < u > not < /u > let you make me look like a fool -- 
everybody . get behind me . 
since <person> started this whole crisis in truman 's life , i came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it . 
is that the queen 's request ? 
<number> hours . <person> still be there . base out . 
what are you talking about ? 
we are ... for the tools . 
because i should have shown her before ... everyday , i should have shown her . 
you are in trouble . now do it . 
how dare you speak to me like that ? i 'm the princess !

there 's a tunnel . 
sixty , maybe seventy families . 
you could have been honest with me for starters . we work together . i have to be able to trust you . 
gay movies . 
yeah , but who 's gon na believe <person> ? i mean , do < u > you < /u > believe <person> ? 
so what ? everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin ' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner . i 'm fuckin ' sick of it . 
we 're here . 
no ... just to know ... because it 's a long time i work ... and i never did anything with my money ... i should do something . 
i 'm not hungry yet . 
did it hurt ? 
i would want to pay you , <person> ... and i was thinking -- 
yo , <person> , check it out . this is the two-one , the 21st century and it 's all about the money . like my man <person> says , `` it 's all about the benjamins . '' 
conscientious , determined , dogged . 
<person> christ , <person> , you are nuts . 
how did they get away ? 
you ever get any false positives ? someone intends to kill his boss or his wife , but they never go through with it . how do the precogs tell the difference ? 
i just ca n't believe this voodoo bullshit . you believe this voodoo bullshit , <person> ? 
hey , yourself . i see you â€™ ve met my ex . 
i love you . do n't feel sick . 
nowhere in particular . do n't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore ? 
yes , you do .

she starts givin ' me some bullshit about it ai n't there . it 's somewhere else and we can go get it . i 'm shootin ' you in the head right then and there . then i 'm gon na shoot her in the kneecap , find out where my godamn money is . i go walkin ' in there and that nigga <person> or anybody else is in there , you 're the first man shot , understand what i 'm sayin ' ? 
and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you ? 
i know . it does n't make any sense . that 's why i trust it . 
no -- that 's what i know you were thinking . 
that was a pretty good escape act at the station . how did you do that ? 
he 's not the guy , <person> . <person> whip the whips . 
oh , i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56 , '57 when i lived down in the quarter . 
i did n't mean it that way i 'm sorry . 
come on , <person> . this is america , land of the free . i thought we might go skinny dipping . for starters . 
that 's because your union bosses < u > are < /u > those guido mother-fuckers . 
after the movie . 
it was nobody . ah ... he 's a poll , taker . i 'm thinking of voting democrat this year . but do n't mention it to your father . <person> was school today ?

<person> <person> ? 
you really in trouble ? 
i 'm ok , <person> , thanks . 
i did n't mean it . i do n't think you 'd be right for each other . but i would never say you were n't as good a person as she is . 
i do n't know how . 
how about letting the people out of the bank . why put them in this position ? 
terrible ! nothing terrible about her . she 's great ! marvelous youngster ! got a mind of her own . knows just what she wants . she 's not going to get it though . she wo n't get very far . has no money .

i 'm a foolish man .

i 'm glad you called . 
christ , <person> , she 's not a spy , she 's a hooker . i picked her up off <person> <person> .

i 've tried that ! population census have got him down as dormanted , the central collective storehouse computer has got him down as deleted , and the information retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... security has him down as excised. , <person> have him down as completed 
well..everything 's closed up . we thought we 'd get some dinner . say ! ... .anybody up for chinese ? have you eaten ? would you like to come along ?

carla -

what ? 
if you kill him , you kill me ! 
how 's business ? 
nah . i 've tried . my writing 's too technical , i think . problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent . i better just stick to making pictures . 
forget it . this is <number> of the longest relationships i 've ever had . i 'm not blowing it now . 
dr. <person> had a picture in his file of the funeral . the father looked just like <person> . even had a mark on his cheek .

nope . 
just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience . you like , `` kicked butt . '' 
okay , fine , they 've got the primes -- but if you 're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come -- 
that 's what i 'm saying . the old ways . the old ways ... convert the motherfucker ... sell him ... sell him ... make him sign the check . the ... <person> , <person> ... the kitchen , blah : they got their money in government bonds ... i say fuck it , we 're going to go the whole route . i plat it out <number> units . eighty- <number> grand . i tell them . `` this is now . this is that thing that you 've been dreaming of , you 're going to find that suitcase on the train , the guy comes in the door , the bag that 's full of money . this is it , <person> ... '' 
what rielly ? 
it 's my mother 's piano . 
well , i ca n't talk though -- 
ah . 
there 's the way , mates . 
why in the hell would you want to watch my kids ? 
makeup . 
the < u > reason < /u > i lied is if i 'd told you the truth , you 'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you 're doing . 
i 'll rephrase the question . <person> <person> is n't it true you are bisexual ? 
and i 'm from mattel . well , i 'm not actually from mattel , i 'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out . well , i do n't really understand the financials , but ... 
they 're executives . they 're nervous about everything . 
he no longer roars or spits . he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --

my client ca n't walk , your honor .

just a second . it 's my ass i 'm risking . you better do it my way . these fuckers do n't mess around . 
do n't worry . in a few seconds you wo n't feel a thing . 
your brother has <number> days . fifty cars . five-zero . for that he gets <number> large ... 
servants . oh is n't it terrible darling , <number> more people have disappeared 
thank you . 
i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place . you can afford to spend some money . if i was you , i 'd spare myself all the hard work . besides , did n't you want to start writing again ? 
well try this <number> on for size . i think i 'm falling in love with you . 
... you 're definitely doing a story ... ? 
all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with . all right , look-you 're a roofer , and some juicy government contract comes your way ; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract , which means all sorts of benefits . all of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius . you did n't ask for that . you have no personal politics . you 're just trying to scrape out a living . 
but honey ... 
well , i guess i 'll ... get down to the station . it was lovely meeting ... 
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with <person> <person> . 
no . you just handed us a new <number> . we can go federal on your ass right now : ongoing criminal conspiracy . intent to buy and distribute $ <number> worth of crank . what 's the mandatory on that , <person> ? 
it is deep ... 
what ? 
i am <person> <person> ' son , and will act as becomes my name and quality . 
you will be , my young <number> . heh . you will be . 
a man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me , captain . 
hell of a ride , <person> ... 
yes . 
-- is what ? 
i could let them go for ten . 
excellent ... excellent ! 
you 've lost your heart 
i 'm flattered . not every girl makes a super-hero 's night table . you might have some interesting insights into two-face . 
show me . 
well , you 're the organizer . you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you 're dead right . but when you figure everything the rank-and-file 's to do down to the last detail , you do n't give us anything to think about . you afraid we 're too lazy to take initiative ? 
yeah . 
i think that you 're lying . i think you know exactly where the money is . 
that 's funny ! 
if we achieve surprise , they will offer little resistance . 
yes , i know what you mean , but i 've already spoken to ferrari . you 'll still win at roulette . 
no . not at all . from what i understand , he knows i '' m here , is n't that right ? 
i have n't given you much of a life . 
sounds like something you feed the dog . 
oh , i see , an easy plan ! 
they send over a few every day , to let them know we 're still here . each shell costs as much as a ford <number> . 
you 'd have to die first . <person> . 
oh , let it ring . 
what kind of school ? 
the word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire . he is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point . 
these more highlights from the zagat prison guide ? 
i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - i wish i were dead - i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - what am i going to do about my engagement present ? 
i ca n't convince the inner woman that we can wait . she 's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on <person> <person> and the other dummies . i 've only had a cup of coffee since last night . 
lily , i do n't think even you could know that -- 
maybe i 'm just fucking curious . 
do you feel bad ? 
you call me <person> , just like home . 
no ... 
what business ? 
what do you want me to say ? 
my blood ? i ... i gave at the office .

you 're conceited -- 
what , you think i did this to myself ? 
under arrest for murder . 
was i a really busy guy ? did i do tick too ? 
you knew him best . 
victor must 've taken him . 
that 's yes ? 
bye . 
you did . 
what did you say ? 
no , i know what you 're going to say . i do n't know anything about making a video . but that 's a plus . 
do n't use that tone of voice with me ... never mind , i 'll take <person> . 
i 'm not asking you for help , <person> . just take off the handcuffs . 
i do n't care if you 're from france or venus ... just take me with you . 
what 's that , <person> ? 
well , if it is n't malignant and she can get through the operation all right , it might be better than her really being pregnant . she does n't even know who the father might have been . 
somebody robbed the vatican . 
we , we ... no ... we just had a small reversal in the case ... i have some , uh ... i have some work to do ... 
why me ? why do n't < u > you < /u > do it ? 
i 'd ask for identification . 
i would n't mind another b.e.e.r . 
she was the kindest , sweetest girl you 'd ever want to meet . oh , i adored her . i supposed i always hoped she 'd be back . after a time , all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things . can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it 's appropriate ? 
i 've got to go see gruber . what 's the best cigars you have ? 
no matter how it happened , if she goes ahead and has it '' zack , there 'll be a child in the world that 's mine -- and i could n't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived . 
that 's conservative , of course . there 's no reason to speculate wildly . 
but you are needed . especially now -- with most of the other men away . you 're captain of the stand-by squad . 
i got ta go get a haircut . 
i was layin ' ? no , no , i 'm taking it . i was takin ' it . 
<person> <person> , my pleasure .

you would n't believe me . 
kalmbach -- <person> 's personal lawyer . 
you did n't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , did n't you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or <number> , as long as you got the target ... 
i ... uh ... check . 
well , you 'd have to keep it under control . 
honey , baby , i < u > ca n't < /u > . i ca n't even get out of here < u > myself < /u > . believe it or not , i need a lousy <number> and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic ...

i wish i could get rid of this thing . 
oh yes you will wear gartersâ€” 
well , there you are . <person> must 've liked him . 
we ca n't leave her out here in the rain ... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area . 
<person> , fall semester , first day of class , it was <number> degrees and you were wearing the coat . 
what ? ... what 'd you do ? 
yeah . 
and she has a right to know that there 's a world out there filled with people who do n't believe in god ... ... and are n't any worse off than you mother . people who 've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once , to anybody . and people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy . she has a right to know that . but you and your ... your order and your church have kept her ignorant ... 
ghastly , cruel , unnecessary .

`` met his death '' ? how could you , his friend , have assumed that ? why did you leave him on genesis ! <person> trusted you -- and you denied him his future ! 
yeah , i could find this lebowski guy -- 
so , you were a failure at the longest , most important relationship in your life . 
i can â€™ t believe you want to move back into the city . i thought the reason we left was because we didn â€™ t want to raise the kids here ?

and , what a delightful idea ! 
i 've been thinking .

i miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence . 
we 'd have to kill him . 
what ? 
`` naw '' ? there 's ice skaters coming ! you ever made love to an ice skater ?

dr. mumford does , yes . i 've put myself completely in his hands . for today , anyway . 
... what does that mean ? 
i 'm only trying to help you . 
it was late , i know . the dooley sisters was already in . they work at a show , you know . 
yeah , sure . 
swamp 's where it 's at , <person> . gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of . you ought to try it some time . 
i 'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning -- what did you say ? 
in other words , what right do i have to talk about terror . 
... i 'm listening . 
it 's alright , dad . 
say you 're the one who got me in this ! 
no ! ! it 's a wonder you could n't get me something i can eat . 
it 's not the same guy . it should be a self-solver . no bow around the neck , left and body outdoors , completely different . the others were housewives , secretaries , he talked his way inside , killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom . this one did n't have a husband or a boyfriend , no family , temp waitress , <number> arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses , dui , asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head . sexually assaulted . the others were n't molested that way . we 're waiting for the sperm tests ... 
he 's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off . 
boy , we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here . wait a minute , i 'll get my diaphragm and be right with you . 
she 's visiting relatives in florida . now his boss , this guy <person> , he 's also disappeared . nobody at his office knows where he is . 
no , thank you . 
i 've been doing this for <number> years . i 'm the best scout in the continental army , the best horseman , the best shot , the best scavenger and i know every deer path and swamp trail between here and <person> . 
i 'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty . what i have in mind is massage -- a perfectly decent massage . <person> around , turn around . 
<person> <person> found out . so you killed him . 
how about a nice glass of milk ? 
hardly anybody does , that 's the beauty part . no cameras , the doj does n't bother with it , it 's accessed by a tunnel they boast about . you know the best place to hide a leaf ? 
yeah ! somewhere in wales . i don â€™ t really know her . used to turn up in a transit van on weekends , sell old furniture at camden . that â€™ s how come he only laid her at weekends , ha ha ... 
how come you 're alone on new year 's eve ? 
<number> thousand for <number> days . and vivian , i will let you go . 
i 'm not sure what to believe anymore , young lady . you never used to lie to me . but lately you do n't seem to know the difference between right and wrong . 
but <person> , i never said that ! 
come on , let 's rock . 
why <person> , what an ugly thing to say ! does this mean you 're not my friend anymore ? you know , <person> , if i thought you were n't my friend i do n't think i could bear it . 
he is real ! ! 
maybe . but not like asians . we never panic . 
because that is your heritage . those are the values we lived by on krypton . 
eighteen ... well , i 'm gon na be eighteen in <number> years , but that do n't mean you ca n't take me for a ride if you want . 
i begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break <person> was muzzle- to-muzzle . he spent too many years in the british army . 
as i said before , we 'd be happy to escort you to delhi . 
you said it ! here 's looking at you , kid . 
i never saw you together like that again . so i figured i was imagining things . 
your momma was n't too proud when you came out neither , <person> . 
there will be no arrangement -- -- and you 're killing her ! 
would you quiet down ! just for a minute ? 
we do n't even like them , i 've often thought of giving it away , but <person> would n't stand for it . it was his first wife 's favorite picture . she was an artist . 
what good are records if they 're not open for public inspection ? 
i know . she just keeps hearin ' her dead father play the banjo . 
that i must not tell you . top secret . you see there . <person> secret . 
no , it was n't <person> <person> , <person> <person> was the other one . <person> <person> made the movies . <person> <person> was like a pam grier tv show , without <person> <person> . 
then maybe you can tell me if he 's as solid as you say , why does he rap me every chance he gets ? 
oh , that 's not mine . 
me ? no . <person> food - it kills me . ever try and fly after <number> of those heavy sauces ? 
today coffee -- -- 
let 's talk about something else . 
there 's something dangerously wrong with this ship , elaine . i know its the wiring . that toilet 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
i hope so 
by definition you 're lying to <person> , too . 
i 'm making a film . <person> <person> 's going to be in it . he said you might know where <person> is . 
i 'm afraid that 's not possible . 
you should . do you have a resume ? 
then why did you bring them ? 
your mind is so slippery . 
what ? 
there 's a war about to be declared , or did n't you know ? 
you 'll need <number> more hit . 
entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm . 
run into <person> ? 
now tell me , why would i want to do that ? 
well , i heard some things . 
for pay ? 
so who 's the lucky guy ? 
i do n't want to see her later . i want to hear her < u > now < /u > . 
before you do that , you might want to look at what i 've been looking at . 
definitely . 
so you met somebody else ? 
<number> book : swedish-made <person> <person> <person> and me : this sort of thing is my bag , <person> , by austin powers . 
it 's okay , <person> . it all worked out , in an odd sort of way . 
another contractor . 
there 's only <number> hardware stores on the whole island . we 'll check that out . what about the blood ? 
quince , i 've got confidence in you . 
hmmm ... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead . 
how are you holding up in this weather ? 
no . 
who ? 
i love somebody . all the time i 've been looking for someone to love me and now -- i love somebody . and it 's so easy . why is it easy now ? 
huh ? airport or airstrip ? 
i 've been expecting you ; i got a letter from the lawyer . 
and there 's only <number> reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into <person> 's bedroom in the dark of night ! i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it ! -- and that is not all i am going to do ! 
we 're -- conducting a new experiment . 
math . history . science . <person> . athletics -- 
you 're not listening . your heart is not . <person> is deaf as well as blind . 
yes ? 
i 'm not , uh , i 'm not arguin ' here . i 'm cooperating ... there 's no , uh - we 're doin ' all we can ... 
i got a lot to protect . 
ok , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ... 
but your voice sounds so familiar . 
i 'll take that as a compliment . 
you mean to tell me you 're gon na count those old birds over there ? 
he did ? 
yeah . she left with some bikers big ones . full of sperm . 
what for ? 
it started < u > before < /u > you , <person> , i never would 've -- 
fine , but i 'm not gon na be no <person> <person> <number> . 
l.a.p.d . 
it will not take long ... 
get us out ! 
is that your real name ? really ? 
did n't it have nothin ' to do with me ? 
of course they 're jews . 
no kidding . i looked over and saw the shadow of <number> curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen . 
i do . 
i 'm on at <number> . 
did you drink and dial ? 
yes . i told you . it was exactly like mine . 
do n't worry about it . 
she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died . 
no , you ca n't . 
have women found you attractive ? 
you get those names come up , you ever get 'em , `` <person> ? '' 
the < u > <person> 's <person> < /u > ? ! god , i ca n't believe i 'm doing this ... 
so , <person> calls <number> and they took off . 
i 'm just wondering -- 
are you angry with me ? 
i wanted to , <person> . oh ! 
no , they -- 
because you like to remember her . i want to see you enjoy yourself . 
give me that again ! 
i 'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all . 
without any doubt , sir . if anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island ... 
how do you know how bad it was ? 
let 's just ... .wait a minute . get a better look . 
i tried to call you before . judy i thought so . 
really ? 
how do you know they 're not ? 
save yourself . <person> fettes look at macfarlane and be warned . 
getting off on the inaugural ? gon na go ... 
i had to save you , <person> . i -- -- please trust me .

and this - if you decide to take the rest . 
i was until about an hour ago . 
oh my god . 
ok . 
<number> years . <number> long fucking years . 
maybe it 's this mix tape i made you . or maybe these flowers . he gives <person> the flowers and tape . 
you do ? 
they 're all the same ! they 're so stuck up , they 're just ... they 're not even human . i hate them . 
you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here . 
a few days ... a few weeks - dunno , i ca n't remember . worse thing is , i never know if it will change back again ... now , please leave me alone . 
i was n't eavesdropping , i was overhearing . 
yeah , he 's going to think about it . you want me to pack for you ? 
well , she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in birmingham , even if she did run away from them . 
i 've 'ardly ever left it . 
why not sit down and wait ? 
i drink . a couple of occasions more than i should have . i was cited for shoplifting once . but it was a mistake ... i pushed <person> <number> time . we were both stressed out because of the pressure . she went to her mother 's . i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself . and i do n't like to be pushed around ! 
it 's a small post and they 're phasing it out in <number> years , but i moved up in rank and -- well , a command is a command . 
i 'm sorry . they live here , too ? 
yes , my master . 
i do n't think i could be . 
a delivery , <person> . <person> <person> brought some birds from san francisco . 
we can take these guys ! 
yeah , that 's easy for you to do . you never had any talent . 
my information is that <person> thought it was a kidnapping . <person> assured him nothing would happen to you . 
-- at the < u > worker bar < /u > ! you were pretty hot to trot then ! 
big hotel billionaire . he was on <person> <person> 's boat ordering <person> <person> around just before <person> got smoked . 
because i found out about her ... 
when served warm -- 
i 'm a lawyer . 
good morning . 
i 've done much better ones than this . 
it 's going to cost . 
do n't worry , i 'll settle up with your boss . we have n't skipped town yet . 
he 's bad news . he cheated on me , he insults me . now suddenly he gets jealous if i have a date . 
the doctor said to allow <number> minutes : no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed . 
found what ? 
uh ... did n't we < u > do < /u > this ? 
what 's that ? 
i 'm not gon na take -- i 'm not gon na take it in stride . i had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out . 
maybe you 'd better ask him . 
i do n't want to hear any tales about colored people ... 
you 're what ?

the costumes . am i right ? 
i 'm special . 
<person> ' to get this fuckin ' tv to work . paid all this money for it and still ca n't get a station a mile away . and <person> <person> here ai n't no help . 
i 'm an undercover agent for the united states secret service . 
you 're a considerate young man . 
no , i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge . 
what you ask is difficult . 
why ? it 's such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again . 
it 's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy . now granted that 's what `` true blue '' is about , no argument about that . 
come on . <person> love horror . 
her 'head ' ? ! you 're making this up ... 
no , i 'm sure it 'll be fine . 
do you want to do bad things ? anything . anything . 
she 's alright . 
i trust you . 
what about the vault ? 
<person> left his passport in curacao . we could hide him ... 
take a look . i rearranged the numbers . put 'em up to the light . go ahead . <person> at it . 
all the time ... 
liar . we saw it in the lawrence kasdan double-bill with <person> <person> . 
that 's it . 
<number> <person> met on the street ... and i do n't know the name of the street and it really does n't matter . well , anyway , <number> 's name was mcintosh and the other 's was mcgillicuddy . mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy , `` hello , <person> <person> , '' and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh , `` hello , <person> <person> , '' and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy , `` how is mrs . mcgillicuddy ? '' and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh , `` how is mrs . mcintosh ? `` ... 
why , i love my father because - because i do . of course , he 's nice to me . 
and he 's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was . 
i 'm on her , amigo . no worries . got ta jam . 
what ? 
put the bolts on that window under a scope , i 'm betting you 'll find wrench scratches on them . 
you have run out of time . the amount now is <number> <number> <number> . i will call later with instructions . you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter . 
what 's the matter with right here ? it 's nice and warm . 
there are no guarantees in this life . 
uh ... no . 
no -- do n't do it . i 'm sure . the truth is , <person> -- there 's no man i 've seen yet or -- must be something wrong with me . i 've been feeling low for weeks . 
sounds like something <person> would say . 
there 's that question ... 
what ? ? 
mother and <person> said so ... you know ? 
they look nice , i agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility , are n't they ? i might get laughed at . how much do you want for these muskets ? 
no <person> , you do n't understand . i 'm through with lawing , i 'm through with the whole proposition . forever . i did my duty , now i 'd like to get on with my life . that is if you do n't mind . <person> . good day now . 
you sleep in that ? 
the roses ? and of course they said yes . 
if i was his size and had <person> on my ass , i 'd just leave town . 
dad ? 
someone dead . 
but the $ <number> you got to get out of town brought you straight to new york - did n't it ? 
i understand . 
i do n't know . wave to them ! 
is it worth it ? a lot of witnesses here . 
i took the road less traveled , adelle . 
<person> <person> taught me a great trick . 
they think i offed the director . 
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in . <person> and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me . <person> breaks away again . 
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation . 
sure ! fuck it ! that 's your answer ! tattoo it on your forehead ! your answer to everything ! 
you must understand , this is all new to me ... 
embezzling , <person> . from my own goddamn wife ! 
yeah . <person> had an association with a fella named <person> <person> <person> . name mean anything to you ? 
if that worked , you would 've done it already . no , you want me to drink it of my own free will . well let me tell you , sweetheart , it 'll be a cold day in hell before i fall for that <number> again . 
i ... suddenly felt such a fool . 
i can explain about the portal , darling . 
i mean , i 'd hate to think i 'd pick up someone who wore that shit . 
wha -- 
kids . 
he 's well-trained . he 'll behave himself . 
i know . you have a way of making an impression . 
sally <person> , now who is that ? 
i love him . 
that 's what i 'm doin ' ! 
guess i always thought they 'd adopt . 
yeah , thanks , it 's ok . 
i know , peanut . but it was n't all like you were so unhappy i was there , just you were upset . my bein ' there was upsettin ' to you . you had some kids there , little kids , and i guess you 'd got married and your husband was comin ' home any minute . 

what 's the matter with my printing ? 
must 've read about the funeral . <person> mother . that 's the last thing you need right now , i 'm sure . 
squid ... squid like ... squid type ... it 's got tentacles , a feed sac ... probably <number> central nervous processor somewhere ... what the hell do i know is going on deep down in the ocean ... there 's all sorts of shit we 've never seen ... eighty foot clams ... <number> foot sharks ... i 'm just guessing ... can you get me more juice out of hercules ... fast ? 
that 's impossible ! nobody has the right ... . you ca n't do that ! ... if you do n't give me that visa ... 
well , my theory is that people can really enjoy math , but they lose interest ... 
i do n't know . we may never know , but i 'm going to guess it was a job , maybe the karpoli family . 
you do n't have to understand . 
do n't be so supportive , honey . 
that 's nonsense , and you know it ! 
so is <person> on your short list ? 
i get my own help . 
so was i . 
i do n't like your tone . 
no . it was closer to <number> <number> thousand . 
easy , <person> , just open it . 
maybe you 're using the wrong approach . 
my father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden . 
<person> leer . 
that 's just it ! you do n't have to flaunt it . you 're no slave to fashion ... although ... 
i wonder if i hang around with you because you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something . like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly . 
i do n't think so . 
i thought they came with batteries . 
wait a minute -- 
you told me to . 
you believe the year is <number> when in fact it is much closer to <number> . i ca n't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know . 
well , each time he comes in closer , like this . 
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred . 
yeah , and you were -- 
wha -- ? yes , sweetheart -- wha -- ? 
oh , it 's definitely better , beyond question . a fatherless child , an ignorant girl with no job , no money , no home . it 's fortunate , a blessing really , and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you . 
it is . he 'd been acting strange . and the physical changes . i should have told someone right away ... but i was just blind . i wanted to pretend it was n't happening ... if i do n't do what i can to help now , i just could n't live with it . 
no kidding . 
pretty much . 
i know parts of who you are . 
you said they would be here ! 
i talked to the army 's bureau of records . you 've never even been to <person> <person> . 
i guess you never saw 'a very <person> <person> . ' 
i ... i do n't feel any differently . do you ? 
oh , in a heartbeat . 
for the moment . but i fear not for long . i 'm of no use to him now . 
i happen to know <person> was married only <number> months ago . if he 's got twins this morning , i claim it was done with mirrors .

but you 'll die . you 'll squash yourself . what 's the point ? 
and why have n't they left each other ? 
who told you that ? 
oh , right ! right ! with those things running around . no way . 
it 's jungle rot ! this room is making everybody sick ! this is your family doctor speaking now . here -- i brought you something else to hang on your wall , for the sake of variety .

why do they bother him on a day like this ? 
very much . 
you 're a great date . i 've never really gone out with someone as basic as you . 
maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy . who knows ? it could be a <number> things . it 's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain , that 's for sure .

of course he did . he came on to every attractive student . which bothers you most : that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me ? 
what can < u > i < /u > do , <person> <person> ? 
go on , little girl , take your troubles somewhere else . i do n't feel like talking to you . 
me ? i 'm a little of everything . some irish , some german , some french , dutch -- the women in my family slept around . and that 's what made this country great . 
come on , <person> , i 'm a federal officer , i 'm armed . 
sure , it you could find a towel in this bag . i know my wife packed <number> in there ... 
i did n't see anything . 
my job , unpleasant sometimes , is to know what others do n't want me to know . 
los arcos . was a little girl kidnapped recently ? about twelve maybe ? 
you think that caused the accident , <person> ? that it brought bad luck ? christ , it sounds to me you 're looking for a witch doctor , not a lawyer . or maybe they 're the same thing . 
i do n't know . i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life . 
<number> , i think . she tried again <number> years ago . i thought you should know . 
okay . 
<person> <number> doll -- - ? 
walk outta there and tell her i was you . 
only violators and practical jokers . 
you wo n't see <person> anymore . he 's sick for good this winter . 
you made squad leader on your own , and , hey , you still got me to kick around . 
no . i want to know . 
do n't stop , just slow down . little more space 'tween us and them . 
ask , you 're the girl reporter . 
may i ask why ? 
billy , were you afraid of her , or of her love ? 
that is incredible . 
i was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder , but her memory of it is gone , at least for the time being . i also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight . any idea who <person> or lonnie are ? 
no ... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile , <person> <person> . <person> composition , <person> <person> ? 
then show me ! that 's what i 'm here for , to learn , to grow ! 
get out . 
we do not go into your courts . 
you shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the `` streetfighter '' . it was the only movie up to that time rated x for violence . but we just saw the r . 
hell , yeah . a bunch of us <person> <person> boys went out lookin ' on account of them killin ' <number> of our own . we come across this fucker on a roan goin ' south an ' ... 
it 's a lot more stressful than i thought . 
glen . not now . i mean , we 're here for tina now , not for ourselves . 
how is he -- ? 
if you want to see us you must come later . 
not really . 
with their underwater experience , they 'll be invaluable . take sidearms , and flare pistols -- 
what is it , <person> ? 
finest kind . we 're training ho-jon to be a bartender . join us ? 
no , just so i can see ya , ya know . do n't have to turn my neck . 
maybe i 'd better take the rest of the script home and read it - 
helluva time for vanity ! 
why was there another team ? 
what 's he look like ? 
i am not responsible for your assumptions . 
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own ? that would have amused <person> . 
as long as it takes , i might stay a week . no more i do n't think . where 's your family ? 
<person> broke into the cavern last night . 
just do n't drool on it . 
sure . 
remembers what ? 
save your strength . 
... <person> , i do n't feel like talking about this . 
that 's all ? that 's enough ! she was a beautiful little girl . 
big day last night . 
do n't like it , do n't come . 
as much as possible . 
i know but i felt like taking a shift . 
to where ? 
i just wanted to , i do n't know , not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since i do n't remember much of it -- 
thanks but i 'd better do history . 
is it getting worse ? 
are you kidding ? 
you do n't have to . you just have to believe in energy . 
what 's that ? 
meet me <person> 's at <number> . 
why did you sign up ? 
that 's a risk i 'm willing to take . <person> down , you 're good . even <person> <person> could n't corrupt you . 
do that . 
it 's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview <person> . 
george , i 've been putting things together . do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot ? and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane ? chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point . what brought them there ? unless it was to meet us ? 
<person> cook . 
go where ? 
i ca n't tell you . 
if it happened to him , then it could ... 
... he ought to put him in here . 
you sure ? maybe next week we could ... 
fourteen carat ? 
nephritis ? it 's a kidney disease , you do n't get it from hot dogs . 
hello . 
well ... 
then why do you want to leave ? 
according to the ancients , cat 's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld . <person> will fear them until he is fully regenerated , and then he will fear nothing . 
i seen you was from dallas . 
black . <person> . 
<person> . <person> <person> . 
i think he might be worried . 
where 's my damn ammo ? nothing is ever where it 's supposed to be around here !

i came this far alone ... 
i deal in u.s. pounds , friend . none of that faggot metric crap for me .

<person> <person> ... ? 
oh ... huh ... how you feeling ? 
drop the gun , <person> . 
let 's split up . you take the left side , i 'll take the right . we 'll meet in front of the cineplex . 
i agree . 
do you know what you were kidnapped by ? 
do n't blame yourself , you did what i told you to do . 
she 'll be all right , partner.. she 'll never find it . we could n't ... . 
hal , i 'm going out now to replace the a.o . unit . 
the 'history ' ... ? 
yes , dear . come on now . <person> , your shoes are soaking ! 
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street . 
i do n't think so . 
just see him , as a favor to me . 
well -- i have n't needed much law so far -- what i 'd like to get first is a little common sense -- 
i mean , i 'm not ... i was n't absolutely sure if ... they -- 
i mean really , deeply angry ... 
we 're tearing this place apart looking for them ... but the computers are down , and the fires destroyed half the files ... so far , nothing . 
i think it 's still available . 
how ya doing ? 
i 'm not arguing . i 'm just telling you what the deal is -- congresswoman . 
lois , someday -- 
is that the technical description of what i 've got ? 
i 'll stay awake . 
i can see her if i want to . i mean , with half of france in the hands of the english , what have i got to lose ? 
what happens if i want to sneeze ? 
and no birds sing . 
not by the thousands . 
amy , it 's me . listen very carefully.. 
it 's not my job to relax . i 've put men facing out both ways down <person> <person> , so nobody can ride in shooting . i 've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case .

we 'll have to go out on tauntauns . 
his mother - we need her approval . but i 'm not worried - because i do n't smoke . 
my mom says the treasure 's somewhere in the school . 
and like every hamburger guy knows , when you get your <number> big chance at the good life , you abuse every second of it until they figure out you do n't belong there and kick your sorry ass out . 
i 'm not crazy . i know the difference between right and wrong . 
how about a plane ? 
he said not to tell . 
hey ... 
i 'm weak ... soon i 'll need to feed . 
what ? 
sure . 
oh , goodness ! did any of them sting you ? 
no . there is nothing else . just being here at night helps me sleep . 
as long as it does exist , your mind wo n't ever be free . i think you should light the match , <person> . 
well , it 's only the truth . there are horrible things in the world , <person> . 
save it .

if i had it , maybe . but right now i do n't have a penny to my name . 
girls dig <person> . he 's cq . you 're total cq , <person> .

they are carrying guns . they are threatening police officers . they are undermining the united states of america . and you inspector brimmer are not taking your duties seriously ... 
ticklish ? 
but you do n't want to hear it .

oh , i am grateful to you , sir . i am the wife of captain o'reilly hastening to join him at dublin . my chair was stopped by a highwayman ; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees , armed as he was , and though there were thirty people in the next field , working , when the ruffian attacked , not <number> of them would help but , on the contrary , wished him `` good luck . '' 
everyone dies but us . we get to carry on and plan the sequel . let 's face it , these days -- you got ta have a sequel .

she 'll think it 's her fault for keeping me . 
he and <person> <person> own the tallow works . but that 's not where he makes his money . he makes most of it from his poetry .

for mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak . 
but how will she look ? the fashions this spring are very becoming to her . gentlemen , the judge will be french , the jury will be french , everybody in that courtroom will be french . have you ever seen a french court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little ? you sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you ? 
move it . we got exactly <number> minutes left . 
uh ... what channel were you watching ? 
the fingerprints . 
all right ! put me in chains ! do anything you want ! but i 'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat ! 
you just left me without a phone call , a letter , nothing . all this time . yeah , i guess i 'm still a little mad . 
`` <person> '' was my mother 's father . 
come here . 
what 's he want of you ? 
christ ! 
but not you . 
`` vicki . '' ice-skater , or stewardess ? 
why did n't you jam it down her throat ? 
why would he pick this <number> ? 
sit down then . we often have a double up here . 
and the bad news ? 
not an option , for the most obvious of reasons . you need to get with the program . seven minutes . let 's get out of here . 
maybe an animal . 
no good . i said they disabled the communications system . 
what year do you think it is ? 
we were friends once ... but that was a long time ago . 
i 've been buying you stuff all week . i 've been buying him stuff all week . 
i 've seen him with women . he flirts . he always has . on some level , i presumed he was cheating on my mother . i just never had proof . 
oh .

i think you 're making a mistake , sir . 
i 'd rather sit . are you ready ? 
yes , but i lost him . i really did it quite brilliantly . i 'm beginning to think women make the best spies . 
sure -- because he could always go pirating . 
now i 've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a < u > food shortage < /u > . well you boys are gon na be taken care of . but in the meantime we 're gon na eat the enemy for < u > breakfast < /u > , we are gon na eat the enemy for < u > lunch < /u > , and we are gon na eat the enemy for < u > dinner < /u > !

well i 'd say he 's at work . do you want to leave a message ? 
it was <person> . he knew i had the gun in my bag . 
i 'm , sorry , but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues . i 've seen so many corpses rolled away ... unrevenged . 
yeah ? 
i thought i 'd wait for you . 
i 'm glad you 're around to say it . 
i prefer to think of it as a mirror . 
showdown . 
oh -- no way . i ca n't do that to her . 
oh , it 's fine . <person> . <person> . <person> . bye . bye . 
i 've been swimming , merv .

-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet ! there , armed with a quill of my own , i 'll commit it to paper ! 
i can have them walk backwards . 
you know you keep saying that . 
it was n't much of a lie . 
what a bitch ! 
crimefighter 's rule number <number> : never say that . 
funny thing . 
yes sir .

nobody 's named this <number> yet . 
poor , tired , spinning girl ... how we feasted on her . and now that we 've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap ... we 're pulling out . that 's paris , where my daughter was born . moscow , where gangsters rule the night and i gave up smoking . so many battles , so many lives ... all that sturm , and drang . as if it never happened . if it were n't for a few power grids , you would n't know we existed . 
yeah , since i was a kid . i had a woodwork class once when i was ... in school that time . then i learned a lot more when i was in the --

<person> ? 
pretty sure .

<person> scott . have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of <number> ? 
my husband has convinced me of the contrary . 
and you ... should be proud . you won that contest and made a name for yourself . 
just an idea i had . 
it 's a free country , is n't it ? as long as i 'm not trespassing on your property . i can stay here till kingdom come . 
he did n't recognize shit . 
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city . 
do you want her to join us sometime ? 
i 'd kill it . 
have fun . 
i was <number> . and ever since , my policy is : act first and worry later . 
but you said -- 
alright . 
i told you `` no '' yesterday ! 
lydia liked me , you see . that was the strange part of it . in fact , now that i 'm no longer a threat , we 're very good friends . 
you ca n't do this to me . it could ruin me . 
no , we had a clear soup to start . this is a thick <number> and you ought to taste it . there 's nothing like it back home . 
circumstances have changed , <person> . 
you were the last <number> i saw just before the accident . do you remember ? we made love . 
dad , the ponds are for old ladies . 
no ! <person> , that i am ! i should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off , as long as ... 
you agree with a lot of what he says , do n't you . 
thank you very much . 
maybe you wan na try the china club . 
no , <person> , and now i 'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although i did n't think so at first , you are really a good man . 
leave here . do n't do this . i do n't want you here . 
i was dreaming . 
but they 're gon na light the tree in a few minutes -- 
because i do n't want <number> .

oh , no , i ca n't let you get me that . that 's too much . 
maybe . 
are you listening to me ? you 're in a world of shit . an eye witness has you outside the dead girl 's apartment . we got your prints all over the place . plus the fucking driver 's license , frank . you got ta give me something here . something i can believe . 
who 's got the contract ? 
i do n't believe you . 
i 'm so glad .

nobody saw what happened to <person> <person> ? 
yeah . 
who do you think the jap is ?

you tell me . 
the grave . somebody close ? 
who 's <person> ? 
well , offer her a seat ! you want me to do it ? 
we 're not gon na hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom . i 'm not gon na sit in congress and write a law that allows the nsa to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like . and the next time you have something to say to me , we do it above-board , in my office , like everyone else . now get outa my car , i 've got a committee meeting on the hill . 
faithfulness he talked of , madam . your enduring faithfulness . now , tell me truly . when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ? 
`` my dear president '' ... 
is that what you thought ? that i betrayed the british ? the british betrayed me . the british betrayed me . 
roger , cougar . <person> boys , pull out with your hands up and nobody 'll get hurt . 
yea , <person> . 
i 'll send them right up . 
what ? yeah . 
i know , <person> , but i -- 
in-vul-nerabo . but you get ass kicked without me . 
i 've always said the <number> reason i 'm the best detective in the industry is that i 'm the only <number> ... but hey , i never throw away a clue ... 
anyway , when that boy came over , it was the first time you ever did anything without her . and amy wasn â€™ t just jealous ... she was sad and lonely . she missed you . 
texas is a big state . 
it is kind of you to make this effort . 
i got no idea of love . and neither have you . i mean , neither <number> of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street . 
we 're going to europe next week . i want to get passage booked on the queen . 
position , my ass ... 
it 's not going to let us out ! 
yay ! it 'll be great ! i 'll get my shit . 
<person> . i was just getting something . 
i like well your conceit , <person> . <person> rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world . 
what are the police doing here ... ? 
a fine fair-weather friend you are ! 
gardiner , yes , sir . 
i said i had a guy to see and i 'm going to see him . 
it 's not yogurt -- it 's mayonnaise . 
oh that 's absurd , <person> . no , no frederick , that 's all wrong ! <person> is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life . and , that is completely due to you . 
maybe somebody crazy , someone with a spite against the church , some unconscious rebellion , perhaps . 
i understand . 
sister ! i 'm his sister ! 
dell , i ca n't write unless i 'm happy , and i ca n't be happy unless i 'm here -- and with you . this is me , <person> . <person> <person> . and i love you ! 
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude , but i grew up in hell . my grandmother had more attitude . you do n't intimidate me . 
there are days . 
i think so . 
oh . that â€™ d be rhian , a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends . she got wise and dumped him months ago ... 
you 're not gon na make some deal with that guy , are you ? i mean , i just wan na know . 
i like it . and think of the toppings -- cheese , mushrooms , mint jelly 
<person> mr inventor , how do we avoid it ? 
then you have never loved ? your heart is empty . 
yeah , i think i got ta get these fixed or something . 
let me see your cash book , will you ? 
shut the fuck up . 
all right -- where is she ? 
who buys italian meat anymore ? you think my wife buys italian meat ? she goes to the a & p , picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane , opens up a canna peas , and that 's dinner , boy . 
always ? 
i suppose we could people the world with vampires , the <number> of us . 
i know you do n't , but if you had , chrom- atically you < u > are < /u > in the purple family . 
let 's take a look . 
yes , your honor . 
the thing ! he was lying there in the street , moaning . but he pointed at it ... <number> 
is there a problem , gentlemen ? 
you want something ? 
we got <number> . putting <person> outside . 
what ? ? 
no , my boy . i 'm afraid none of us can . 
it turns to steaming piss . 
a foursquare , upright , downright , forthright married lady ... that 's for me . and no more make believe ! off stage or on ... remember , <person> . i mean it , now . grown-up women only , i might even play a mother - only <number> child , of course , not over <number> ... <person> , will you promise not to be angry with me ? 
what is this ? is this a ... present ? are you kidding ? 
what was she to creasy then ? 
that 's ludicrous . this is contact . we have found god . the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth . so how will we describe it , if we choose to describe it at all ? 
well we did n't kill him , he died on his own . 
oh , <person> ... 
wait . bullshit me a little ... i 'm beginning to appreciate it . 
`` <person> ! '' 
your soldier . 
maybe later . 
i think to myself what problems could she possibly have ? 
yes ... 
maybe that 's what you 're counting on to get you off the hook . 
but you enjoyed it , yes ? 
course not . 
the rain ... sometimes it gives me the blues . 
is it true that in the year <number> you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york , to assume and consolidate your nefarious power ? 
i 'll explain . 
i 'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class , especially since i rule . is the pelican flying ? 
why did you take sleeping pills ? 
no . 
how is the patient faring ? 
i like it too . 
trust me , you 'll want to take this call . 
liar ! thief ! torturer ! when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast . 
you and <person> 'll make a great team . i 'm gon na make a deal with him . 
-- what , who ? oh she 's very nice , yes -- i mean normally -- - 
maybe ... maybe if we traded them the gold . if we gave it to them they might let us live ; they might not kill us . 
yeah ... sure . 
i ... i mean ... ... i ... it 's none of my business . 
do it ! just do it ! 
yes -- but i am afraid of being deceived . 
... so you think i should go . 
fine ! instead of saying `` next month '' -- we 'll use <number> word and say `` june . '' 
i 'm sorry , i ... 
so you believe me ? 
then turn it off , <person> , because it does n't get any better . 
so forget what you 've seen on sixty fucking minutes about the kinder , gentler military -- you will either succeed , quit , or die by my hand ! 
we 're not gon na go see any fuckin ' elephants , okay ? 
i ca n't , dummy . he 'll see that the pack 's been opened . you 're such a dumbhead . 
i have a different story for every woman who asks . i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me . 
because i bought the windshield last week . i 'm a hubcap away from owning more of bambi than you do . 
fuck you . 
i need your help . 
yeah . 
yeah , right , publicist . 
my name is <person> and i 'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house . 
you do n't think there 's much time left , do you ? 
are you listening ? 
<person> left her close to <number> <number> dollars in his will . that 's motive . she admits to being there the night of his death . that 's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle . 
i 'm sorry . 
i was going to ask you the same thing . 
yeah ! ... i 'm goin ' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years . <person> na take the day off and go to the beach . 
oh , yeah -- right . 
<person> is coming to pick me up . 
you and cassandra get anything done last night ? 
stop the car ! now ! ! 
no . but once i heard ... 
come back ! ! ! 
you would tell me , <person> , would n't you ? 
wait . <person> ? you do n't know anybody who 's black ! 
i 'm sorry , but can it wait til tonight ? i 'm already late for work -- 
you either . 
i 'm working across on a cattle boat . 
nobody knows where he is . we know he 's all right , but that 's all . 
all i want you to do is think about what 's best for you . really think about it . 
let me have those . 
i told you : when i straighten someone out they stay straightened . this is how it works : nobody touches the gold . except when we 're on the move and someone 's carrying it , nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it . agreed ? 
excuse me , my dear . 
no-o ! 
never heard of him . 
you do n't hardly get settled till you 're frettin ' to git home again . 
good lord . what do you study in history ? 
you ever think about gettin ' remarried ? 
yes , <person> , away . <person> , away , away . 
jabez -- you ought to talk to <person> about joining the grange . 
the powwow safe where you steal your money ! where you cheat your indians ! 
that 's the whole idea of living in the country . i thrive on the seclusion . 
of course , if <person> were here , he 'd say i was being an irrational , illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that . 
are you staying at the hotel ? 
a little strange , <person> . 
what happened ? you described this `` crazy-kooky '' family who 'd be a <number> laughs on tv ? 
he wo n't see us ... we 'll just stalk him from a distance . 
that , and the sweet smell of <number> <number> <number> bucks . 
... she keeps her back to the camera ... ? 
not all . some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams . some never make it this far . 
wow . 
take it easy , raimondo . why are you getting so impatient ? 
i do n't know . 
yes . 
okay . <person> else have any questions ? 
oh ... i lived with a president . it is n't any fun . 
... a flaw ... 
i told everyone seven-fifteen . did n't i ? seven-fifteen . 
well , if it 's my last order , then i order them to be there ! tell them i will give them my decision then . 
how many men ? 
yes , i think i amused them . to what do i owe ... ? 
< u > i tell him no visitors < /u > ! ! ! 
yeah , got dead drunk , passed out in the bottom of the riverbed . 
jesus . how 'd you know about <person> ? 
yeah . down there . 
what is it now ? 
it 's like recognizing criminals by their crimes . 
i still want to look over a couple of things . 
where 's the head ? 
i thought that was <person> <person> . 
me too , oh , i tried to convince myself , believe me , `` it 's like being married to a doctor , '' i said . doctors are practically never at home . the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it . then a voice said , `` could you be a doctor 's wife ? or are you too selfish . . . `` 
i 'm sorry . 
you 're gon na get hit tonight , bad -- a whole regiment of nva regulars . 
what ? 
you sure can , son ... 
hell , no . that wayne ca n't shoot when he 's sober , much less drunk . he 's lucky he did n't kill his own danged self . well , anyhow , you stay cool . nice meeting you , son . 
well , i am saying it . bring in the jury . 
that 's typical . i hope she did n't expect to make the best seller list with this thing . 
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow , so ... 
fi ' cents ! they pain ' you fi ' cents ? 
i mean credit references , <person> <person> . 
the chop-shop ... where are the stripped cars ? the rolled-back odometers ? the part bins ? 
we get it at work . we get the magazine at work . 
how about ding dong ? 
all of it . 
if i did , i 'd have kept my mouth shut ... it fits , <person> ... fifty-five gallons of <person> confiscated <number> years ago ... guess who was in on the collar ? mac . he salts it away somewhere ... he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists have n't figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum . 
ever ? 
do n't be an asshole , <person> . come here . 
get out of here . 
who ? 
<person> , the woman needs help ! 
oh man , i 'm gon na enjoy this <number> ... just remember , <person> , you did this . you brought this on yourself ... 
this is a big day for the guards . they get to remind us who 's boss . 
i just thought that -- 
yeah , we 're having some problems , but problems that are my business ... which i do n't see how you could know about in such detail . how does <person> know about these things ? how ? they 're private ! 
good idea . 
upham , are you sure you 've never been in combat ? 
i 'm just thinking , you know , if the rest of the boys knew what we 're doing . i mean if they knew what we were coming back with . 
and so you feel nothing . 
yes ... 
what if -- 
sounds fair enough . 
how do you know there 's <number> ounces in a drink ? 
i was afraid you 'd say that . 
do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the united states government in regards to your testimony ? 
hmmm ? 
i 'm terribly sorry . he does n't seem to be here ... no ... yes , if i see him , i will . .. <person> . she 's going to phone back . 
qualen , glad you stuck around . there should be a few <number> cops looking to meet you . 
p-p-p-please , i 'm not armed . m-m-my g-god . you killed ... <person> <person> . 
well , i 'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here . 
you got the wrong girl , <person> . 
no questions . 
jimmy , is it ? do you know me , <person> ? 
well , actually , it was the name of my drama teacher - <person> <person> . perhaps you 've heard of him . he was such an influence on the development of my instrument . that means my body - in theatre talk . well , when i came to hollywood i felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form , so i took on `` sunshine . '' dore is my real name ... well , dore , actually . my , what a lovely place you have here . 
do n't think so . stay the fuck back . 
just , you know , to chat a little , maybe . i have a long trip ahead of me . how far are you going ? on the train , i mean , of course . 
yes . 
you do ? still ? i ca n't tell you how happy i am to hear that . 
would you ? 
i do n't believe that . 
erin . i 'll always be with you . 
christ , twenty seconds , <person> ! 
bring us an ashtray for <person> <person> , please . she whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence . 
very good . 
all right then . 
yes ... 
they could kill you . 
what is she shooting ? 
i did it for her . 
what did they want to know ? 
he even had me wanting to play for the `` <person> . '' man , how stupid am i . 
i heard something . a squeal . 
more your line . 
your last chance . give me the name . 
no , wait ! 
i see . 
never took a bullet . i pulled my gun once . fired it once . 
mischief ? what the fuck you talkin ' about , mischief ? 
great ! ... if he 's worthless we 'll give him away as a bridge prize . come on -- beat it . it 's <number> o'clock . you need some sleep . 
yes . there are certain punitive measures ... 
i mean , i 've looked everywhere . 
you do n't know anything ! <person> <person> , these are my ships , right ? so i 'm telling you we 're turning back ! 
<number> weeks . i had to rent some equipment . 
you 're pregnant ? 
i 'll say . this is solid gold . 
well i do n't ! 
i did n't see that . 
many things my french father can not do , <person> can . 
just so you do your work . 
i hear she 's a very pretty girl . 
you got it , stud . 
... terror . 
what do you want to know ? you saw it , you saw the loop ... 
<person> pass . make your way up through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl . you should be able to pick up <person> 's tracer there . once you go inside , you 're on your own . you know what you have to do with the girl , do n't you ? we have to spare this nation her trial - for treason . 
not big in the sense of large â€“ although it 's that too . i mean important . this may be the most important work i 've done . 
keep up with that attitude , and you wo n't have a future . <person> is a hell of an age to die . is that what you want ? 
i took the padlock off your door . what more do you want ? 
no ... i would n't say that ... just like an actress ... you know . 
why not ? mmm ? 
you made me hurt him ! 
what , you do n't think i can beat him ? 
yes , ma'am . 
<person> killed my partner .

okay . 
you 're the oracle ? 
why ? what 's wrong ? 
there must be a way ! what about engineering ? 
just wanted to see . 
look -- committees -- small groups of senators -- have to sift a bill down -- look into it -- study it -- and report to the whole senate . you ca n't take a bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men . where would you get ? 
my home is here . with you . 
we have at least <number> months ' work left . we ca n't write a report ... we do n't know enough ... . 
what time does the show go on ? 
why 's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us ? 
and if i win ? 
<person> and <person> declined . guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog . 
rowan 's already called the hotel , <person> . at the cemetery by now , i would guess . 
in case you need me to testify about the shooting . they 'll clear you . 
take your shower . 
sue the shit out of 'em . 
it 's a miracle . 
not yet . what do you know about it ? 
she 's the toughest to read . 
no . 
last week ? when ? 
you want it ? 
yes . 
dewey , there 's no such place . 
look , we have <number> choices . we can hike back down to the lagoon , where we can sit for <number> days , in the open , next to a heavily used water source while we 're waiting for your boat to arrive , or we can head for the village , where we might find some shelter and we can call for help . 
i ca n't just let him stand by the door ... 
i know a lot of brothers dog their wives , i just never thought my pops would do some shit like this ... 
you know <person> <person> ? 
the thing 's kind of heavy . 
what is it -- what are you talking about ? 
we took our time with them and gave every <number> of them worse than they had given at the fort . it was <number> weeks before they were all dead , all except <number> . we put the heads on a pallet and had the <number> we let live take it to the french at fort ambercon . the eyes , fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the asheulot to the cherokee . the french stayed east of the blue ridge after that and the cherokee broke their treaty with the french and stayed out of the fight . that seemed to make a difference . the war went another year , things went better ... and men bought us drinks . 
what ? 
great ! ! ! 
okay , okay . i think . 
int . helicopter - day . 
see y'at the finish line . 
and i 'll give then proof !

<person> , ca n't you just deal with this yourself ? 
i would n't talk about things like that . 
max - where ? 
when you get a chance . 
i do know . i 'm a cop . this is what i do . 
i wanted him to have fun - and with me along - 
when you were his student ? did he come on to you ? 
<number> months . but this <number> is not guy . it is girl . his girl . 
take me now . 
all or nothing . you want to roll them for me ? 
what about the others ? 
i mean ... well ... affection . 
of course . 
i am so tired of your bullshit , <person> . 
very futuristic . <person> does n't really go with that butch haircut ! 
what was your deal with <person> ? 
i must ... consult with my father . 
all i mean is ... someone like you ... 
are you serious ? 
look around , this place is a dump ! naw , it 'd have to work to be a dump . 
oh , it did . it had a great deal to do with you .

but i 'm here to help you ... 
hey , you 're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world . i took a shot . it did n't work . did you bring the tapes ? 
you putting a hurtin ' on my vision . 
very good . now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid . 
what 'd you do , < u > build < /u > this ... ? 
actually , i am , though . 
we 've noticed and we 're glad . but , you know ... how are we going to make peace here ? we want to make things easier for you . what can we do ? obviously i know how special <person> is , and i know things ca n't be good for you at the moment . i 'd hate it if i lost her . but i 'd like to think that if she decided she did n't want to see me anymore , i 'd respect that decision . do you see what i 'm saying ? 
why ? 
well , hunt , what are your plans ? 
i do n't pretend i came over on the mayflower -- 
i have a book report . 
i do n't know . what do you feel like doing ? 
oh , <person> ... 
what does that have to do with anything ? does it explain the barricaded subway stations ? does it explain those godforsaken creatures ? 
we 're talking about <person> . we 're talking about <person> <person> . and i 'm asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with <person> . was this treadstone ? 
how could i know what 's in the archive ? 
<person> probably told you we found <person> <person> . 
yeah . 
if you do n't shut that hole in yer face , there 'll be <number> less in this boat ! 
how ? 
happy to see you looking so good . 
that , i could n't tell you .. and do n't worry about anya this crap , by the time you 're back it 's gone .. 
hold on . 
let me see if it changes colors on me . 
i 'm not stopping . i 'm on my way . 
this is the street he walks down every day . when he needs inspiration ... 
while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems , i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive , jewish pride weakening substance on the planet . i bought the entire plant . 
still alive , but it 's just a matter of time . and then will come your miraculous resurrection -- 
that 's an editorial we , of course . i have n't turned up anything personally . 
i went with <person> and vera . <person> was there . stop it . i just had a drink , that 's all . i did n't do anything wrong . 
that dude was torn limb from limb . no way a woman like that could have done it . you never seen blood on a chick 's sheets from her period ? 
i 'm sorry , you know that ? i 'm really sorry . 
you said it yourself : <person> 's not dead . if they had the package , they 'd have killed him . 
<person> robinson . well , what have you learned ? what do they want ? 
a man scared me . 
now see here , my good man . i 've had just about enough of your insulting remarks ! 
you bloody ... 
picks up again just on the other side . 
ladies and gentlemen , there is no need to go there . we can all agree to disagree without making threats . 
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact . 
no . that 's what everyone thinks . <person> shot a man dead in baltimore <number> months before . 
that 's their job , is n't it ? to argue . so , i think my case will be long on talk and short on action . 
-- yeah , we did that -- 
oh , i know you , <person> . i know you real well . 
my lord , i 'm not sure that ... 

any day now . 
rowan ... 
yes . 
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate -- 
but sir , i do n't understand . this report -- these recommendations ... they 're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life . 
i 'm in the book , if you ever want to drop me a line or something . 
shhhh ! 
oh , you 're very clever . let 's make love , you silly , hairy little man . 
how interesting . 
you watch yourself . 
just the legit shit . 
i 've got secondaries of an engine fire and i 'll need to find a clear area to eject . 
i do n't want you up all night reading <person> 's case file of the <number> millionth time . <person> , dear girl , is the key . leave the work here . 
anything ? 
command is n't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell are n't going to let them surrender . 
not these guys . 
even simple . 
you know every story , every wound , every memory , their whole life 's < u > happiness < /u > has been wrapped up in < u > you < /u > , every moment ... 
distance from reliant ... 
hey , do n't blame me ! you did n't say anything about no motor when i was up on that ceiling ! 
god protect you , <person> <person> . 
it 's none of my business , but when are you and <person> gon na tie the knot ? i always wondered why you never did . 
let 's get it out of here and bring in a new <number> . 
uh ... 
what about <person> ? 
the penny drops . < u > you < /u > are < u > not < /u > job . yes , <person> is not given to quoting scripture in his communications . and there was its tone -- aggressive but playful . <person> is not playful . so you 're something of a paradox . 
well , yah , i was married . i was married to - you mind if i sit over here ? 
hi , ted . 
i think it 's dunn & < u > <person> < /u > street . but then , i could be wrong ... 
the police are on their way . 
how can i do what i do now ? let 's just say i spent a lot of time in the prison library . 
do n't be sorry . you 're not taking it . 
<person> <person> was my girlfriend in college . i almost married her ... 
there 's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you . i 'm embarrassed to have -- 
il signor <person> ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali ? 
biology . she wanted to be a doctor . 
leavenworth a tough joint ? 
not exactly , <person> . i 'm not sure where you 're going with this -- 
i do n't golf ... 
then , you 'll take her to see <person> ? 
titus , you 're so stoned , you 'd end up in spain . 
not since last night . he took a guy hunting . 
well . 
a deeper level ? 
oh , that is more beautiful than i ever imagined it ! i wish i could show you to mommy and daddy . i wish you could enjoy <person> with us . 
you do n't sleep with him . i do . i do n't get to breathe without tellin ' him . he keeps me in a cage . if he thinks i 'm lookin ' at somebody the wrong way , i get used as a punching bag . he do n't trust nobody . if he saw the <number> of us talking together right now , you 'd be in trouble too -- believe me . look at me , <person> . i 'm <number> years old . i wan na enjoy my life . i love <person> , but you do n't know . he gets crazy sometimes . i 'm scared . 
naw , you missed me , copper . try this on for size . 
except us . 
i can talk to these people <person> , they trust me ... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts . 
do n't believe it . i 'm just skin deep . 
how ? 
i wo n't . now run . fast as you can ! 
do n't you lie to me , <person> . you still have your daddy 's watch ? well , this is all i can give you . i wish it was more . 
-- tonight he forgot . 
i 'm not talking about <person> <person> or maxwell jones , buddy , what i 'm talkin ' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you ! 
you 're a great catcher . 
how do you know that 's the way ? 
yes ? 
i was worried about the rig . i 've got over <number> years invested in this project . 
he 's got nothin ' to gain by lyin ' . <person> ' at all . he already got all their money . i just do n't know what we 're dealin ' with here . anyway , it went out again last night on nationwide teletype . <person> 's just wait it out a little longer . she said she was gon na call back . <person> 's just sit tight . 
you wo n't disconnect . 
good . you 've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer , <person> <person> . how old is the child ? 
it 's a mess , right now . that 's my project when i get back . 
i do n't know ... 
hey , <person> ! 
can you give her something ? 
i have to try , dammit ! something , anything . . . 
i understand . 
it 's okay . give me the gun . 
first rule of assassination : always kill the assassins . 
i mean , we 've had ups and downs , right -- good times , bad times ? 
i 'd have to say my spine was broken , keyser . 
no . no . 
stuffed and baking . 
they had to pump it out . 
maybe he 's gay . 
yeah . 
no , <person> ! individual performance is only part of it . i know why baseball players choke for no reason , i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert , and need to , to give a great performance , but what i want to know is , how fear works in a group ... 
<person> made me sign <number> . 'guess we 'll find out what else we have to talk about . life stuff . 
i ca n't take him to work . 
do you gentlemen know each other , <person> <person> -- <person> <person> -- <person> von gaigern . 
killing her wo n't solve anything . 
how the fuck do < u > we < /u > know . you take my point ? 
when he went to work , right . 
really ? how many ? 
case . <person> yourselves comfortable . anyone like a taste ? 
yes . i want you to go . 
that 's the `` big guy '' . quite a paintbrush he 's got . 
it 's ok , take your time . 
i see . slipping away for a little hanky-panky . 
it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are ... otherwise we 'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system ... what a waste ... 
sit down , jake . 
what ? 
this is important to me . 
yeah . <person> <person> . <person> . couple others . <person> said even <person> called the other day . nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder , huh ? 
a sin against < i > what ? < /i > 
do <number> thing to me ? get me <number> shot at anchoring the weekend news -- they 've never seen me do it . i think it could turn them around . 
hey . 
<person> ? yes , we have water , we have a little in our can , we have water in the radiator which can be drunk . not at all cowardly , extremely practical . come on , come on ! there 's also a plant - i 've never seen it but i 'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid . 
you 're crazy ! 
some < u > <number> < /u > ? gim me a hint . 
to our ... partnership . 
injected <person> ! why would he switch to a new m.o . ? 
bet ! <person> , bet here ! 
if i show up at your door , chances are you did something to bring me there . i do n't care about that stuff , anyway . 
and that 's where you 're not being clever . he would n't parade his crime in front of the open shades . 
francesca ? 
thanks . your dad called again â€“ something about a job . 
after all you 've said ... do n't you know the part was written for <person> ? 
... break away completely from -- 
it looks like dwarf bowling . 
the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief . 
i know , <person> . 
they could n't have thought this up for themselves . 
what about ? 
keep it . 
he commands it whether he exists or not ... look , we can fight him and be crushed . or we can submit . 
yeah yeah yeah . <person> yadda yadda . were you stoned ? 
is that a baby ? 
do you bite your thumb at us ? sir . 
more'n likely . 
... imagine a better grape for the region . 
turn around quick ! 
shhhh -- 
c'mon , <person> . let me play him . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
yes , captain . 
not really , no . 
i do . 
because it struck me how neatly 'three ' went into the amount . <number> <person> <number> thousand . that would mean i keep seventy . 
what the fuck are they waiting for ? that motherfucker cut off my ear ! he slashed my face ! i 'm deformed ! 
perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little . 
i 'll let you know the next full moon . 
yeah . you do it . 
that 's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people would n't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation ... 
he says he knows his face . he sees it when he closes his eyes . 
he 's a good friend of mine . drops by the club whenever he 's in town . 
good . ba will have to teach you to spin too . 
the crown `` negotiating '' the terms of service ? 
who cares ? mmmm . now i remember . mayo the wop . <person> , i 'm glad you 're here . i 've been looking forward to this all week . 
jody , wait . 
some people take , some people get took -- and they know they 're getting took -- and there 's nothing they can do about it . 
instant v-goddam-d . 
no . you just described every great success story . <person> , it 's alright . 
yes , <person> <person> . 
i 've found a <number> inch fracture in the outer hull . we should be able to repair it and re-pressurize , it 's gon na take some time . 
a `` description '' ? what , asian male <number> to <number> , black hair , brown eyes ? 
maybe you do n't know . i know you though . you 're <person> <person> and i know where you live and i know ways to get you and i know ways to kill you . 
um -- not right now . 
i 'm a married man . 
what unit ? 
i know where you live : in a locker , in a bus station . what 's it like living in a locker ? 
it 's obvious what you have to do . your way into the daughter 's pants is through the mother , up the suez canal ... 
no , <person> . 
you really are stupid , you know that . 
[ i believe you . ] 
that 's what people see , but that ai n't necessarily what i am . 
you-you play ... very well . 
hold on ! 
that 's it , we 're done . 
nothing good . 
yeah , i guess . 
do n't think i ca n't persuade her . 
we 've been notified that they rejected the sentence ... 
mom , please . 
whatever . 
thank you , sir . i 'm sorry i embar- rassed you . 
nope , not yet . their fingerprints do n't match up anywhere . 
see ! 
<person> about . i thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with <person> . 
look , i 'm telling you again and you 'd better believe it , i 'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum ! 
it 's hospital policy ... 
excuse me , <person> <person> . i know this takes a lot of nerve , but - who are you ? i mean - i 'm pretty ignorant , i guess you caught on to that - 
guess that 's why he hid it there . let 's go . 
no , dad , it is n't . 
that 's very funny , that is . 
no ! washington square , manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like a-bombs . did you get pictures ? 
... my feet are hurtin â€™ ... 
just give us what ya can , <person> . we 'll send a truck down . 
huh ? 
make it <person> 's , i like the toy department . 
central high , 'n ' matinees , the bijou theatre . 
picking out my wedding dress ! 
everywhere . you ca n't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy 's butt was cute . who the first babe to say this was i do n't know , but it caught on . 
not chip ! please ! <person> ... if you have <number> iota of human feeling , you 'll take me instead . 
i thought the books were blank ? 
no -- she did n't . 
it 's the truth . 
what ? 
that 's right . 
you do n't understand . it 's already in you . 
i 'm also called `` <person> <person> . '' that means `` crazy pig . '' 'cause i enforce security and get people to tell me what i need to know . that part of what i do , you never want to find out about . other people will negotiate the money and go or not go . not me ... 
the children can stay . 
thirty-percent . no more . or i call another lawyer . this is the biggest case of your life . do n't try to negotiate . thirty percent . say yes or no . 
she knows now . 
is that the truth ? well , we ca n't carry on like animals any longer . 
okay . 
i 'll be back . 
you 're late for breakfast . 
actually , it 's a big secret . oh , this is delicious ! what is it ? 
all right . finish the job . let 's get outta here . 
due to the fact that you retained the residence , ms. bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately . 
call up the bank . i called them . 
the reason i can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that i have a lighter density under <person> 's gravitational force . 
oh , they 're so stupid ... i 'll just tell them he 's going as a sausage casing . 
this has not been my night . my clothes are in the wash , i spilled butter down the front of me , i got stuck in a window ... 
do you do washing machines , too ? 
`` young people in love <person> very seldom hungry . people in love <person> very seldom hungry . . . '' 
yes , but . 
what ? 
i never fucked up before , <person> . 
i think so . <number> right , <number> lefts ... 
i 'm not afraid of the fire anymore . it will purify me ... 
i 'm not sure . 
okay , so , here you are ... you go to work for tobacco . you come from corporate cultures where research , really , creative thinking , these are core values . you go to tobacco ... <person> is a sales culture . <person> and sell enormous volume . go to a lot of golf tournaments . the hell with everything else . what are you doing ? why are you working for `` tobacco '' in the first place ? 
<person> , help me get her home . now ! 
you do n't owe me anything . 
do you think the police did a good job ? 
`` wee <person> <person> runs through the town . <person> and downstairs in his nightgown . crawling through the window . at the end of miss emma 's street . <person> <person> has gone and left his home . so her and i can meet . '' 
no percentage in that . 
i used to . with my old man . he taught me how to hunt and trap . trapping 's a lot harder than most people think . we used to go after <person> mostly . they 'd get into our garbage , our fields . when an animal ca n't live peacefully with those around it , it has to be destroyed . but they 're crafty little devils . you see the trick is , you can put your trap down , but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent . you ever smell <person> scent ? smells like shit , but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy . he 'll walk right up to that trap , even though it do n't look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it . you know why ? cause he ca n't help himself . the scent drives him . so , if you want to catch a raccoon all you got ta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he 'll walk right into the trap . 
what if we blow the walkways first ? leave jason over here to go up with the ship ? 
no .

what have you done , <person> your hand ? 
i have no claim , <person> . 
i have <number> more piece of news . a baby is coming . 
it 's for the museum . he knows you 're a painter . if anybody should be invited -- 
you 're kidding ! 
she has confessed . 
recommendations . 
with us old creeps ? come on , we have to eat .

i do n't know . something . 
so he said it quite a few years ago . so what ? i never looked better in my life . do you know why ? because i 've never been as happy in my life .

there 's no standing between a fool and his folly . if you must babble your news to him he 's at the fisherman 's tryst . it 's the inn at pennycuik . you can use macfarlane 's horse and gig to get there . he 'll welcome the ride back . 
nah . once i get my own wheels , i could come up all the time . 
no one . 
no one must follow your work . 
i actually know this <number> . 
... it is much better down there . it 's a better place . 
why did you go ? 
hey , hey , hey , stresshound ! are you nuts ? if anybody found out about this we 'd be in serious trouble . the judge could n't have been clearer - no ghostbusting . 
well , that key 's not gon na work . i had to pop the lock . you did n't leave me the trunk key . 
no reason . 
i spoke to your father the other day . 
mom and i fought for <number> minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white . 
she knows stuff about me that only you know . 
no , on the campus . i have n't any family . 
right ! 
christ , ai n't they all . all them retards wan na do is fuck and eat . 
sure . in a cage . 
okay ... 
why ? 
i pray for that . 
what peace conference ? 
we 're doing <person> . 
he was lucky ... sit there . 
maybe you 've got the wrong crypt â€”â€” after all it 's twenty years when you wore last here . 
fresh guy , huh ! what you need is a good sock on the nose . 
stay cool . 
it 's almost like a conspiracy , huh ? 
what did you put in all those ammo boxes ? 
aye , sir . 
i promise ! 
it 's no use screaming at a time like this ! nobody will hear you ! help ! 
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth . but i 'm trying to be honest , okay ? <number> years is a long time . do n't ask me to predict how i 'll feel then , jordan , because i do n't know . and either do you . 
<person> â€™ t nazi hunters do the job ? 
art ? 
you think i 'm staying ? 
why do you ask ? 
mkay , kids from all over the state have been brought here , because you all share the same problem . uh , young man ... let 's start with you . 
you do n't have any money put away , do you ? 
just a guess . she ai n't dead though is she ? 
sounds good . i 'm just going to run up to my room . hop in the shower . <person> into my jogging suit , and i 'll be right there . 
<number> -- 
but i do n't want you to make up something . 
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings ? 
i do n't know , <person> , but for god 's sake ... this is nuts . do you really understand what they 're going to do ? 
hey , listen . you 're not going soft on me , are you ? i mean , you 're not gon na start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like i 'm some kinda princess when i burp . 
they have these little sticks , vince . they call them `` chomp chomps '' , and when you get these girls going , you have to stick 'em in their mouths . 
do n't worry about it . 
fine . how are you ? 
i did . 
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing . how does <number> do that ? how does <number> kill a man ? it 's <number> thing to dream about it . it 's very different when you have to do it , with your own hands . 
the police called us . 
right . fire up all systems . 
naawww . 
oh , stop it . but you were having an affair with your college professor . that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course `` contemporary crisis in western man '' ! 
too late ... there 's something i must do ... 

seven hundred each . 
funny is funny and scary is scary . you do n't mix them . 
there is no wisdom , no insight , no plan 
i 'll take my chances . 
are you serious ? 
this is n't colonization , it 's spontaneous repopulation . all our work ... if it 's true , then they 've been using us all along . we 've been laboring under a lie ! 
well i pull out the manual on their setup , which is the new <number> server ... 
greetings , <person> . 
what ? 
i 'll take her with me to the university tomorrow . i ca n't believe i read the test wrong . i did n't see anything that looked like she was suicidal . 
want to hear my philosophy ? do it to him before he does it to you . 
must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared . 
well ... it 's beautiful country , i 'll give you that . and i could see having some kind of vacation place . <person> . but i do n't know how you do it full time . do n't you miss the rest of the world ? 
... <number> . have you ... have you found him yet ? 
because he did n't even know about it . the cia never told him , they just kept it going . it was like ... it had a life of its own . like ... a kind of `` beast '' that does n't even know it exists . it just eats people when it does n't need 'em anymore . <number> days after the bay of pigs , <person> called me in . he reamed my ass ... 
i do n't know it . 
can you see anything ? 
did n't think you 'd make it . 
damn it ! how long to fix ? 
i saw the longing in your eye -- 
`` make the shot . '' 
so you felt it too ! 
resuscitation ? 
of course ! that 's what negotiations are for . 
i really got ta pee . 
do you want me to stop ? 
it 's a free country , is n't it ? 
coffee ? <person> ? or how about a little cocoa ? 
you are . . . nothing . i am father now . 
let me guess , russia came up ? 
<person> <person> 's always got rope . 
and a fifty foot extension lead ? 
i do n't own a television . 

because you looked like a nice guy , and i was a little scared . and i sure couldda used a nice guy about that time , so i spilled my popcorn on you . 
hmm-mmm . 
gim me the binoculars . 
is this `` alice in wonderland '' ? 
it could help with a new car -- 
you lost me , <person> . who ? 
<person> cooper . i never went to sewin ' lessons all them times . 
so you say - go on , <person> . 
[ beat ] i 'm not deaf . 
now she tells me . 
well , i am a great admirer of your work . i read your books on chartism when i was still at school . i 'm a journalist , not a historian . there are questions of method , and approach . i wondered -- 
we 're here . 
when will they be back ? 
the whole facility was shut down in the forties , was n't it ? some kind of scandal ... 
hyper-active hyperdrive , and astro ... uh , turf . 
so where are you now ? 
my side , shit ! 
<person> <person> - 
i never use mine . but it 's a good thing to have . just as a threat . 
stop ! who approacheth the bridge of <person> <person> answer me these questions <number> ! ere the other side he see ! 
me , too . i 'm taking <person> <person> out -- i finally talked her into it -- 
did those <number> muscle heads shake you down ? swear i 've seen them down at the track with sure-shot riley . that 's it , ai n't it ? a gambling debt . 
yes . 
let 's just say , <person> works too slowly . 
describe him . 
<person> gay . 
i 'd love to . 
chosen to go to the graveyard ? why do n't you just take the first runner up , okay ? 
how 'd it happen , then ? 
stop playing me <person> . 
so ... i 'm not too concerned with long term plans . 
something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation . something that would affect the entire planet . 
when i was a kid , i used to have a dream - i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts - 
mrs. caldwell i think you 're misunderstanding something . 
do you have any pictures if her ? 
you were never apart , you and <person> . he kept asking and asking . and i waited and waited for you to say something . and you never did . 
i do n't get it . 
no alcohol . you got ta get something else . everything 's ten dollars . what do you want ? 
well , that 's not what they think . 
off limits . 
the adm ! quickly ! where is it ? ! 
i 'm thinking about <person> . ai n't that funny ? i have n't had a moonpie since i was ten years old . right now , i 'm thinking how much i 'd love <number> . 
<person> <number> degrees counterclock wise . 
why special ? 
oh . <person> , what 's up ? i 'm totally in the dark . 
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this `` <person> <person> '' and asked to fly to dallas and be <person> <person> 's layer . 
yes , you did . 
all i know is i opened that refridgerator -- 
in jail . 
that 's the best part . she gets it all -- everything . 
call me . 
fuck ! my money ! 
the phone . what did you hear on the phone . tell me . word for word . 
that 's right , sir . but the planes were at their positive control points , ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final go-code . 
yeah . what ? 
`` ride the clouds '' . good picture . 
you think you 're so smart , mrs. stone . you wanted to be near jabez . it looked like your big chance tonight , but you 're wrong , you ca n't win him back -- not that way . 
and what you 're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work -- 
people have been crucified before . 
you know , there 's no ... 
i 'm straight , <person> . they have n't got shit on me . look , i 'm tellin ' you , he 'll take the deal somewhere else . 
this here is the younger gang ! 
no ... nor build bonfires ... nor beat drums neither . i 'll meet you on the far side . 
at christmas . we had fought . i did n't like her boyfriend . i -- she has a birthmark on her hip . 
minneapolis . 
i ... i just want you to be happy , <person> . 
can you bear it ? we hear you 're a friend of freddie 's -- he has i hate <person> tattooed on his chest . 
more light and light , more dark and dark our woes .

back from where ? 
yes , mam ... 
you 've wasted enough of my time , fella . 
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace ! 
it does n't have to rhyme ! 
now what what ? 
let 's not jump to conclusions . this egg could belong to any number of reptiles , dr. frock . 
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together . maybe everything happens for a reason . something bad to force something good . 
this is <number> big house for <number> single person . 
jay , this is <person> ! meet me at the main air lock ! 
woman drivin ' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . she called the police and they came over and arrested me . thought i was a sniper ! boys at the vfw loved that <number> . <person> did n't understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . i was gon na put out poison , but i was afraid somebody 's cat would eat it . <person> , i had <number> cats myself . so i used the .22 because it did n't make much noise and the ammo was cheap . 
i hear them coming upstairs . i wo n't be able to talk for awhile . i have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep . so do n't talk . do n't say a word or they 'll hear it . 
what i can appreciate is insolence , mr <person> ! 
i just wanted to introduce myself and inform <person> <person> that there will be an inquiry . 
<person> , i 'm going to flag a cab . 
well , suit yourself , then ... its your decision ... ha ha ... a little joke ... suit yourself ... 
good . a bomb . on a blind tip from <person> <person> -- we do have laws . 
you look great ! the uniform and everything ! 
well , come back when you do , and i 'll bond out the stewardess . 
i was grateful to him . i owed him my life . and he loved me . he could n't always show it , but he felt it . 
looks like we 'll have to send someone down â€“â€“ a lot of people are asking for help for a man named <person> <person> . 
intense .

i thought i felt mean tonight . but i 'm notâ€” i 'm justâ€” all mixed up ... . 
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ...

man , day-day is my people ! 
<number> stories . 
must go faster , it 's getting closer - must go faster ! 
and no questions asked . 
they 're composers , <person> , from the nineteenth century . <person> was rehearsing a part in h.m.s . <person> before he left ... `` a british tar is a soaring soul , as free as a mountain bird , his energetic first should be ready to resist a dictatorial word ... '' 
that 's your line for tonight , ya know . 
oh , he 's ... he drifted off . he 'll sleep for a while now . what is it you have to do , exactly ? 
i 'm not a thief . 
i ca n't . but perhaps tonight , over dinner ... i 've just had an opening . 
i 'm just doing some christmas shopping . it 's for my wife , no kidding . though , this is n't the < i > main < /i > present , it 's just , you know , a little -- 
that 's what i said . 
i know . i 'm putting that in my next report . 
i was scared . it was all kinda queer , but it sure felt like <number> and <number> was coming up <number> ... and then they took <person> 's <number> snapshots from me , sent them to washington , and when they returned them weeks later , <number> of them had the backgrounds mutilated ... the only <number> we saved was in mary 's camera . i did n't want to go to washington when the warren commission subpoenaed me ... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at parkland hospital . 
okay , then how 'bout we ask you a few questions ? 
well , maybe these men wo n't think so . we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up . it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat . i happened to look out the window and there was <person> <person> with this green thing draped over his arm pulling <person> down the walk to the car . 
not true . shall i tell you what you were thinking ? you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt . 
that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind . 
flanking riders ? 
they said you 're the <number> .

is that true ? 
nothing . do n't worry ... i promise i 'll get a job next week .

do n't worry . i 'll be on the train . he leaves . 
this way ?

daddy loves to whip up campaigns ! people eat it up . we 'll make this kid a celebrity . the whole world will be waiting for <person> 's answer . 
darcy ? 
be it so ordered . the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question . this hearing is adjourned .

i dabble . may i ? 
pace , your daddy 'd love you even if you did n't have no hair at all . 
i do n't want to be the chosen <number> , okay ? i do n't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires ! i just want to graduate from high school , go to europe , marry <person> <person> and die . it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you , but i think it 's swell . and then you come along ... and ... and then i 'm a member of the hairy mole club , so you throw things at me ! 
shut your bleedin ' hole ! ! ! 
hey -- if a good man can make a better life , let him make it .

need a little help with that , mr collins ? 
okay , i 'm a little tender . 
matt , look ! there 's <person> <person> ! 
is there something i do n't know about ? 
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot . 
he works the boats as a `` come-on '' man . we ought to make a fair combination and do a little business . <person> 's a pretty good dealer himself . 
you mean <person> said , `` i need you , <person> ? '' 
just so you know , i bought you out with <person> . i suggest you leave while you can . 
i do n't care - i 'm just used to you , that 's all -- if you let anything happen to him , you 'll never wag that tail again ! 
i will i promise . 
there is no news big enough . 
i need someone to work on budget projections . 
i 've found him too . 
that never changes . you know , when you and grandma are gone , the family 's gone . i never see the cousins anymore . 
you have such a head for knowing . you know everything . 
i 'm hungry . 
i called your god-damned office ! i want you to kill him , <person> . you 'll do that for me , wo n't you ? i loved him , i loved him ... that bastard . 
the un is far away , dear sir . it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs . if i were in their place , i would use bombs . 
now , <person> , just a minute -- 
no . no , i do n't believe it . <person> o'connor would never let anything like that happen . he gave me my shot in this business . if it was n't for <person> o'connor i 'd be -- i do n't know where i 'd be . he 's a wonderful man ... 
when was the last time you saw <person> ? 
<number> dollars ? let 's grab a highball ! 
the brunette . the <number> you told me about . 
what 's that ? 
what are you doing , <person> ? 
you ca n't just not show up like you do , you have to go . 
like you do n't give her a hard time . 
jeffrey . are they important things ? well forget me - you have to tell him . <person> . i mean it . 
um ... no . i do n't have a statement at this time . 
here it is , some advice -- do the hard thing . 
really ! that 's wonderful . 
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience . sometimes , in some cases . it 's necessary to take a risk . i got to thinking . i 'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman 's apartment . you know . sneak in and hide and observe . 
no . i - i 'm just curious , you know . i was wonderin ' how much he would put into a thing like that . that 's all . 
well . everybody has reversals . if you were never down how would you know when you were up ? 
why ? 
the lawyer ; questadt , he belongs to roth . 
you 're looking for a bomb . 
well , you have your story , i have mine . i say i entrusted the money to you , and you stole it . 
please , <person> ! i need help ! something is wrong with me ! 
what 're you gon na do next ? 
but i want to make some changes . get <person> in here right away wo n't you ? 
how do they know it 's over ? 
twenty-two . 
... that 's true . sometimes they change , sometimes they do n't . now , i remember back to when you were disbarred ... 
i know . you told me . i 'm okay with it . 
leather purse ... 
get outta my way . 
no , she ca n't move for an hour . 
i just said i did n't fuck around . but you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me . 
hey , do you know something ? she supports a mother and <number> kids . what do you know about that ? 
please - no names . just call me junior . 
a landlubber . come on , what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there ? was it some kinda macho thing ? if that 's all , i 'm gon na be real disappointed . i hate that macho type . 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
then there is a god . why do n't we take that baby picture . 
except they 'll blow you up if you do n't play along . 
and you ca n't tell me what the proper channels are , because that 's classified information ? 
you know what that will mean for <person> . 
i can not take comfort when she has none . 
i never was . 
thanks . 
maybe i just want to hear you say it . 
<person> <person> made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until i came to see you . it seems <person> <person> 's attorney , ms. finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point . 
everything is quite all right . 

well ... 
rose , i do n't have time for this . 
i was telling your wife , we have a very good case here . 
<person> thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life . people can be very frightened of change . i know i was . 
oh my god . 
it was my fault . 
central park . 
red , i -- 
thank you , sir . 
they 'll probably move at dawn . 
you 're crazy carryin ' that kinda money in this neighborhood . no wonder you got hit . 
sit down . 
no , not really . it 's ... it 's in my mind . like you said . 
rose , i realize you do n't know this boy , but if you know anybody who does know him , if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be , then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife ... and i do n't mean maybe . 
mudhole ? slimy ? my home this is . 
no , you have a press agent do it . 
let her in , what 's the difference ? let her in . no , actually , no , i 'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later . 
will you ? 
a young man seeks her . a young man about the age i was when i met you . 
fishing ? 
i always felt if a -- boy i liked ever found out -- he 'd run . he 'd think i was unclean . 
you do n't understand . this is an emergency . let me talk to anyone . 
i really do n't know . <person> <person> 's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market . 
dewey , you and i would never make it . 
do n't even try to remember . 
and what does that cover ? 
are you scared ? 
<person> <number> ring ring . <person> ? 
maybe not . but you know more than i do . you know something about this box . something about a statue ? 
you mean she got a bad batch ? 
what 's that ? 
she was right behind me , i turn around , she 's gone . she could be anywhere . 
deal ! 
well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .

he wo n't discuss it . just calls it history . 
inch by inch ... . 
no , i mean was it right away or in the night or when was it . 
yes -- it is . 
stow the receipt . i 'll take the cash . 
liar . just tell me who the bank card belongs to . name and address . 
yeah , i saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal . 
could i borrow your guitar ? i thought i might be able to cheer her up . 
we got free tickets . 
yes , she committed suicide yesterday . that 's not news . i heard about it last year . 
yeh , she 's ... i 'll get you <person> first , it 's past his bedti ... 
was it the bogyman ? 
well , hi ! 
no , thank you . 
they like you . okay ? 
mmmm . i like to swim . we might get along very ... 
how much is the lemon meringue pie ? 
call me from new york before you leave ? ? 
color me impressed . i thought you grew out of <person> <person> . 
and if the teeth are n't <person> 's ? you 'll give this up ? 
look , not having been there ... i just think you 're hurt and you 're saying this to , you know , get back at him . 
oh ? 
<person> . 
not yet . 
does she want to be ? 
yeah , i guess . i 'm just a little fucked up . 
you are bad . you are a bad person . you are a bad person and you have no right to take people 's confidence in your service -- 
like you taught me ... 
to what do i owe the dishonor of a reunion , you centrally intelligent scumsicle . 
do they have him on display at the weekends ? 
she 's getting herself up to go out . i think she 's coming down the hall now . 
the amulet ... 
you know , the place where you gave the bad guys the codex ... . the mayflower museum . 
they can come to the concert in the park . 
address ? 
yeah ... 
i do n't think you 'll appreciate their choice of weenie . 
yeah . 
if i was a cop , a real cop , i 'd have busted you a long time ago . this is n't about you , it 's about the job i have to do . 
me neither . i 've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married . you think yours did ? 
geiger counter ? 
naomi , i guess . 
only <number> thing can save the children . the unquiet spirit must be laid to rest . it is an abomination to god and man . 
all the time . we all live in southie . i live with <number> of them now . 
never . 
so you came to me ... well , this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all ... 
what else ? i gave her a schaff [ italian-american slang for 'tap ' . ] 
what did you hear ? 
on a day like this . consiglero , do you also have in your notes the the turk made his living from prostitution before the war , like the tattaglias do now . write that down before you forget it . the turk will wait . 
of course . it 's the way any decent man would feel in your position . 
then tell me . 
chief , maybe you had a little too much to drink . 
what about the documents he promised ? 
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe , sipping our lattes wearing <number> thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation . but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden . was n't s'posed to , but it did . and it 's back to the law of the jungle . you got your predators and you got your victims . 
so , your dead hubby shot me twice , <number> of my customers have been eaten , and there are angry creatures outside ? 
yeah . i bet he would . 
see <person> , <person> 's truck swerved off the road and ah ... <person> <person> and then a tree . she was pinned between the <number> . 
as long as it 's on soft paper . you may ... find this curious . 
it 's the truth , jake . 
yes , of course . 
for ten more minutes they love him , <person> . i 'm sick of him and i 'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public . 
yeah , but . i do n't think it 's going to do much good . let 's go . i 'll try to talk to him later . 
if you ever want to see <person> again , then you better come with us . 
what ? 
you nervous ? forget it . the cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade , believe me -- 
the alarms go off ... 
but i just wanted to say -- 
i really do n't know , but i do know that you must return the ring . you get <person> to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady .

..or hard wired.. 
i 'll tell you what 's gotten into me . i do n't know you from <person> , right ? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it . <person> . i said i 'd check it out and i did . now i do n't know what kind of fool you take me for , but you have used and abused me , and i do n't like it . 
why 'd she kill herself ? 
georgina told me how kind you were to her . it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr. macfarlane . 
then do it through my lawyer ! 
you know exactly where they are ! 
did you miss me ? 
temporal nexus , yeah , i heard you . something 's missing . 
twenty-six months ? for murder ? i must be your lawyer . 
i 'm sorry . 
well , bye you guys ... congratulations !

oh , just put it over there . 
of course . 
helen , he 's the man from the space ship ! i had that diamond checked at <number> different places . nobody on earth 's ever seen a stone like that ! after what <person> told us , that 's enough for me . why is it nobody knows anything about him ? why has n't he got any money ? 
we 're aware of that . 
well if you were in my shoes , dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis , you 'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick . 
we 've got some paperwork to take care of . pretty soon . do n't worry , you wo n't run into him in the parking lot . 
i want someone i can get close to . i do n't know if that 's possible with you . 
why ? 
aye , sir . 
that 'd be something . 
no . 
that 's actually the easy part . 
oh . well , i just talked to cindy this morning . she loves california , but to quote her , she says , 'the secret service is getting to be a drag . ' i guess she wants her privacy ... 
brown , <person> <person> . 
in the timeless words of squire <person> ... 
i could n't care less . 
yeah , you think so , but it comes up . 
no , sergeant -- not history ... eternity ... 
melanie ... 
why do you fret about something that is n't there ? 
we do n't know that yet . it 's much too early . there 's a lot to be done . 
the number was <number> - i bet it combination . 
if i can . 
i got it.. 
what do you mean , not the type ? do n't you know who i am ? i 'm big <person> <person> ! i 've been in more porno movies than you ever saw . i 've worked with <person> <person> . i 've worked with <person> <person> . not the type ! i can come ten times a day . i can keep it hard <number> hours at a time . my cock is <number> inches long . 
you 're nothing ! you 're nobody ! you 're a stupid dream . well all dreams come to an end . 
send a man there . a secret agent . 
he 'd rather have the loan payed , you know that . 
i do n't know . 
but he 's not the right guy ! * 
hello , <person> <person> . how do you feel now ? 
a grail ? 
get back ! 
ah well , there you go . <person> , i 'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee , are you coming ? 
what are you talking about ? we went through all this and the ship is n't even down there ? 
<number> years ago ? it wo n't wash , pumpkin . no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he 's a father . i was n't born yesterday , you know . 
<person> <number> . 
yes , it was reported , but never substantiated . 
the stories people tell , he was a real colorful fella -- 
i was n't expecting this . i need to think . 
hey , you 're always saying , 'bring me real life . bring me street life . and , like , <number> man 's mundane and desperate existence is another man 's technicolor . ' 
their true name is sequoia sempervirens : always green , ever- living . 
so i could watch the girl that lived under me . 
it will take the entire day , but he will begin to doubt himself . he will begin to believe that he missed me , that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe . 
that 's right . 
... pete ! come on . 
great . 
<person> , <person> ... 
but that 's what you were thinking . and that 's okay . because i know you love me . not like it is with <person> , the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you , as opposed to me when i walk in a room and that look comes over your face , `` what does she want now ? '' 
he is good . <person> not as good as price . 
hundredth cabinet meeting . i thought it was a nice touch . 
did n't think you 'd use that fibrillator on norris if you were <number> of them . 
it 's a test all right . they 're bringing in stanley . 
they did n't tell me . 
yes , sir , i did . 
i will- be good , kids .

that what they call you ? 
so whose car is it ? 
<person> chloe crack ? 
when i came back , i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman . 
never mind ! <person> ! 
okay -- i do n't know about this . 
going after killers is n't the same as chasing poachers , <person> . 
whoa , <person> . maybe . but we ca n't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe . 
scottie ... 
some sort of childhood trauma , she thinks . possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp . interesting , huh ? 
c'mon , what are you ? and are you a businessman ? or are you a newsman ? ! because that happens to be what <person> and i do for a living ... 
a bird ! a bird in a gilded cage ! get that thing out of here ! 
last week . then i rented you another <number> on top of this .

yeah . 
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now . my father is an ironmaster . as was i .

why the hell we drivin ' here ? 
not true . besides , <person> 's the romantic .

oh shit , what 's today ? 
you wan na get us busted ? if <person> found out you were turning tricks -- 
it does not .

this ellingson security creep . i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me .

what 's wrong with oxygen ? 
yeah , that <number> . somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you .

you like it ? 
yeah , it 's the highlight of my day . 
now and then . he gets drunk a few times a year . 
what kind of tent ? 
if we did n't have election tuesday i 'd have this on my conscience . 
that 's impossible . if it 's that big , why has n't anybody seen it ? huh ? tell me that . it 's like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool . 
stuff it , man ! 
tell him you 've loved him for <number> years , but you were afraid to realize it . 
but you wo n't . 
i just think pictures should say a little something . 
<number> moment , i 'll be right with you . in fact , a ... <number> point , which i spoke to you of which i ca n't talk to you about here . 
ye-ah . was it ... it was yours actually , but , uh , i approved it immediately . 
cynthia , i do n't think you want to , i mean , you should see the way he dresses . i really think he 's in a bad way . 
i ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort -- 
`` follow in the footsteps of shiva . do not betray his truth . '' 
<number> <number> , <number> <number> and thirty- <number> pounds .

you sick fuck i 'm tracing this call as we speak ! the police are gon na nail your ass ! 
you burned the score ? 
i do n't want to do something anybody can do . 
you decided what you were going to do , <person> - some time ago . you ca n't always have it your own way , regardless of anything else that may have happened . come on , <person> . 
all i did was kiss the girl . 
do i ? 
true . 
<person> too . 
swimming . 
no fucking way . 
forâ€” not being any help ? 
you <number> take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds . we 're there for those stones , period . since no display cases are being fucked with , no alarms should go off . we 're out of there in <number> minutes , not <number> second longer . what if the manager wo n't give up the diamonds ?

he stabbed my mom <number> times in the chest . 
<number> hundred ; <number> maybe .

let me ask you a question , if i may . how do you think she got the job in the first place ? i do n't mean to burst your bubble , mantan the marvelous , but <person> is an opportunity . 
go home now . 
i was just thinking of what 's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you . 
what 's wrong with that ? 
hey , freud , what brand of bullshit are you shoveling , huh ? right now he 's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy 's panties , singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter ... 
you should learn a little patience . 
are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract ? 
would i lie to you ? 
hey ! there are crazy people here . 
i do n't have any business here . i came here for you , i did n't have any business . 
yes , we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city . it 's connected by a transfer shaft . 
< u > what < /u > is this , a whorehouse , or are you my < u > wife < /u > ? 
once a month you could n't let her use the kitchen ! 
call the number . 
i 'm touched . 
yes , i do . 
i 'm okay ... i 'm okay . 
we 'll get it later . 
being a jerk is better than being nothing . 
maybe he 's not quite as romantic as you are . 
this is mole . it 's good . 
good . 
each egg has to be perfect . 
he 's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be . |but <person> does n't like it like they do . i suppose that 's why he 's good at it . 
good . she 's a good girl . are n't you ? yeah , she 's a lovely girl . and you know the queen 's riding tomorrow ? 
<person> told us where we could find <person> . 
he 's dead . 
the pebbles forgive me , the trees forgive me . so why ca n't you forgive me ? i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you . 
oh yes , of course . 
i 'll be a minute . 
he 's right . our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies ... 
or <person> -- 
and do you remember where she got off ? 
unbelievable ! <person> told me he wrote it . he 's history . 
<person> . 
i 'm sorry , sir , i apologize . but if you were n't a captain , or if i were a major , what would you say ? 
mimi ? ... oh , <person> 's mother . does she have to be up to something ? 
seems to me he got himself fragged . i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent . maybe a rumor . <person> man -- remarkable officer . <person> <person> woulda been a general some day . general of the army . <person> , head of the joint chiefs of staff . did you knew <person> ? 
shh ! ca n't talk like that now . you 're in ... you know ... 
aye . 
okay . because i know who did it . so.. i 'll just be outside . 
do you like the people you work with ? 
did i act stupidly last night ? should i apologize ? 
today is tomorrow . 
who was the last person you had sex with ? 
what , and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him ? did i tell you about my birthday ? 
i did n't tell you to replace any gasket . 
what ? 
i must have missed <number> minutes . what are you saying ? 
apart from those shotguns . 
i got an a ! 
<person> <number> dollars reward . in the whereabouts of il dottore fanelli , or the apprehension of his ... 
hi , mrs. boatwright ... i 'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day , <person> <person> . 
and you will be out by tomorrow morning . 
once again , do n't call me <person> . a recent unknown intruder penetrated , using a superuser acount , giving him access to our whole system . 
really ? okay ! 
well ... 
yeah ? who was he talking to ? <person> ? come on , o'donnell , everyone 's wondering what 's going on . what 's <person> doing in town ? and do n't give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks . <person> 's mr . cold war . 
we ai n't goin ' down the river . 
that 's a nice teapot . 
fuck you ! my mother was <person> . 
<person> dylan , this is fbi agent thomas mackelway . remember me ? 
this pageant 's like a roach motel . 
it 's possible . 
you want to make a wager on this ? 
someone 's gon na see us . 
what if we do a mailing to congressmen . 
i know . simultaneously , they shake and zip . <person> bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo , placing it on a tray next to an identical <number> . 
she said all of <person> 's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could . i liked that . 
nothing , if you leave right now . there 's a war going on all around us . do n't get in the way , please . 
fucking northern monkeys . 
that 's okay . i 'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer . <person> 's the same , but it 'll be much more fun . 
but , i have no experience . 
if you like , why not give me fifty dollars each to pay <person> . i guarantee he will accept that amount from me . 
i 'm gon na try and get us across the border . 
yes . 
sure . i 'm starting an <number> hotline . <person> part of your phone call . and even if i had n't , there 's the dark pinstripe , <person> , elegant , not too hip , which rules out advertising , plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of , looks like <person> ... 
next time , date only basketball players . 
you 've got a point there . 
actually , there was more this time . this time , we found a picture too . 
i do n't know that i can do that , mrs. marsh . 
would you like to meet him ? 
most kind , <person> . 
you should n't listen to her , she 's a nervous old nellie . 
oh well ... branding will do that to you . 
good enough for you . now then -- -- tell me something i like to hear . as many times as i hear it ... 
how 's she going to know where to -- 
now it makes sense , the whole neo bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you 're a poor little rich girl . 
i knew it , i knew it . things are getting complicated . 
the woman 's surrounded by fools ! she has to be packed and ready to leave by <number> thirty tomorrow morning . knowing that lot , they 'll still be dressing her at <number> . 
all right , <person> <person> . but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is . 
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once . 
well , i can tell you some stories â€“ 
you are acting like <number> ! 
kind of a bleak point of view there , is n't it <person> ? 
why ? 
primary target the icbm base at laputa . <number> weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand . second weapon to be used if first malfunctions . otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of karnak . fused air burst at ten <number> . 
it was the experience of a lifetime . 
dennis ? i want you to release those people . 
for them to protect it like this , you just know there 's got to be treasure down there . 
school ? i never thought of school ! if i went to school i could blend in with everybody else , could n't i ? 
well , i guess i better look for another <number> , then . thanks , anyway . 
<person> , we can re-open the beaches in august . 
it would n't have made any difference . 
no , i 'd like the scarf . 
you know it does n't include the amp . 
what do you want from me , <person> . 
but first you have something to take care of ? 
goddamit ... 
goodnight , <person> <person> . 
passionate ! he 's a pervert . he should have to register when he moves . 
what was her name ? 
kathryn , i know all about you and sebastian . 
it 's what the maids are for . 
she â€™ s your dog , <person> . 
you ca n't kill me , <person> . i 've got something going this saturday night ... it 's gon na be worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaohs -- and only i can stop it . 
ahh -- then she 's still alive . 
you do n't know ? 
you were always friendly to me . i appreciated that . you know , this used to be a fantasy of mine . 
if it is n't here , why would he wear that stupid key ? 
of course . 
is there a problem ? 
and i thought you were a bright woman . 
heard a lot about you , hunt . <person> disappoint me . 
en ingles <person> . this is the united states . we speak english .

i 'm afraid so . i spotted him this time and kicked him out , but he 's getting trickier all the time . 
no , sir . 
you never get over it . 
not your ... 
congratulations . 
<person> told him you were killed in a hot tub accident . 
but i do n't know anything about programming . 
play it again . <person> something . <person> went in the john , see ? washed his face , cleaned his fingernails , made his mind a blank , combed his hair , came back all ready to go . you were through . you saw him , you saw how he looked . <person> , all set to start all over again . hold tight and push hard . you know what you were doing ? you were waitin ' to get beat . flattened out on your butt , swimmin ' around in glory . and whisky . probably deciding how you could lose . 
well , the idea 's right , anyway . are you going to call me ? 
any night . 
i 'm a puppeteer . 
you got <number> minutes , that 's all . make up your mind . 
grow up , <person> . you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life ? 
we 're ok . 
you 're also an idiot . 
do you like me better ? 
i believe what he said . 
where 's <person> ? where did she go ? she was here ... 
phil for god sake . 
bobby -- 
you name it . 
my jesusâ€¦ 
you 've always loved the animals . 
just when we have all the cards , vaughn . take these <number> behind the van . 
<person> <person> ? 
that was n't clever . that was just nasty . 
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch . i 'm chairman of a group that 's sending a little korean boy through school . we plan how to raise funds and ... things like that . 
you do n't have to tell me . it 's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress . i just hope you 'll remember there 's never been a great poem called `` tits and ass . '' 
dude ! <person> , i 'm sorry ! 
yes -- that is true . 
i 've got a situation here and -- 
really ? 
but why <person> ? 
you can holla y'self hoarse . ai n't gon na bend my will . right or wrong , you gon na mind me . <person> na suffer you like <person> say , to the faithless and the perverse generation . 
are you offering me a bribe ? 
i swear to god , i did n't do anything . 
i could n't believe ... did you see the size of that thing 's mouth ? 
let 's go down and find her -- i need a drink -- come along zinnowitz . i do n't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years . 
imagine how he feels . 
hi , is this your first time calling ? 
the front door slammed . <person> went out . there 's a different car starting . 
... see you but ca n't hear . did you ... order ... ? 
can i get some help over here ? 
there must be some way . 
not half as bad as i feel . 
the house is not full -- is it really full ? 
look over there . 
i do find myself physically attracted to you , <person> <person> . 
would n't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ? 
well now <person> , how did you come to get so involved ? 
wrong . <person> is when you gun down your brother . you 're out . my turn . 
i do n't know what you came here for , but we wo n't have any part of it . 
you 're damn right i 'm serious ... . 
i know . i love that . 
i think what <person> <person> is trying to say , <person> , is -- 
no . just to comfort you , and appreciate you -- 
take your time . 
and she 's super-nice 
nevertheless , <person> <person> -- you 've got it . 
against a window . 
'and the people on the street , the little man who runs the corner newsstand , the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare . ' 
their weapons missing ? 
my name 's 
no . we pray to krishna to help us find the stone . it was <person> who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to <person> <person> . to find sivalinga -- and bring back to us . 
-- think what you have time to think , <person> . 
you 're not supposed to be here , ma'am . 
what about your twelve brothers ? 
oh yeah . <person> <person> , stick-up-the-ass , my- way-or-the-highway death . believe me - over the course of eternity , you get pretty damned tired of < u > that < /u > schtick . < i > < /i > so i need a job . he sticks me in this broke-down amusement park , with a buncha animals to run it . i 'm supposed to be < u > grateful < /u > ? 
there are no bond certificates . 
hermaphrodites ! i rented it so we could watch it together ! 
just a friend . 
i think you do . <person> yet , i do n't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place . and i think <person> <person> , whoever he is , now knows that . 
i-i read a poem of you and thought of his last week . a poem of his and thought of you last -- you 'll be fine , though . <person> walks over to elliot in the center aisle . she looks at the book . 
just my luck . 
count d'algout is still asleep . 
oh , no , <person> , please . <person> , please . m'mrnm . 
fatigued , certainly . but dead is a little extreme . on the other hand , when me dear <person> had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live . 
you do that and you 'll have murdered your father . 
end ... ? 
yup . <number> years old by our count . but he does n't age like we do -- think dog years : he 's barely out of his teens . 
did he find anything ? 
i 'm not your boy , jake . i do n't like you , and i do n't like what you are . i got no choice but to do business with you . this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience . 
i 'm very sorry . perhaps you misunderstood ? 
well ... perhaps i have `` deviated '' the tiniest bit . 
then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor , that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off . he said he was going to `` fuck some sense into me . '' 
not according to the computer . 
i thank you for getting me out . but i got ta finish what i started . 
really ? 
what motel you staying at ? 
what right do you have to take me for granted ? 
around here ? why would they ? 
the question is not who am i . the question is where am i ? 
the time has passed for men like them and me . i know it . but they 're still fighting for survival , like cornered animals . that 's why they 'll kill you . -more- 
you think too much . i need a man who does n't think so much but acts more than he thinks ... is what i need ! 
when is that ? 
he mentioned you had a girl for a while . a singer . 
`` life is crushing in on me . '' 
how ya doin ' , <person> . staying comfortable ? 
what 's you depth , <person> <person> ? 
they report it to the irs . 
he must be . they 're letting him go , right ? 
that 's because it was n't on their list . who knows what else they were up to ? 
oh , on the contrary , the albatross is considered a very good omen . it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on . it 's very bad luck if you kill <number> . and dolphins too . 
stop that ! no ! somebody help me ! ! ! ! ! 
i know -- but you -- you 're going to help . 
no . 
and these cops ? what do they get ? 
yeah , i just picked the one that sounded the easiest . 
she said what you said she 'd say . 
dinner time ? ? you 're like a dog ! you just go home to eat . 
what ? what 's this ? 
no . 
hungry . 
how long had that been going on ? 
i found him . 
because there are <number> species of birds in the world today , <person> <person> . it 's estimated that <number> <number> , <number> hundred and fifty <number> birds live in the united states alone . the <number> continents of the world ... 
what a pity . 
that place is already bad luck . 
i 'd like to ask you about your hobbies . 
you look a little tired .

i 'm here . 
hmm . so , <person> get that car he sold you up and running yet ? 
yeah , me , too ... 
in the past year i must 've said a hundred times `` we got ta get out of perfection . we got ta better ourselves . '' you gon na stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i 'm the reason we 're still here ? you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right < u > now < /u > ? 
what ? the dead guy ? she 'll get over fucking the dead guy . <person> , my mom 's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years ; i call him dad . 
eric , leave it alone . it 's not your business . 
i still am . 
jeanne ... calm down ... ! <person> down , <person> ! 
who , for instance ? 
burn ? ? are you kidding ? it 's freezing ! 
jesus . 
it was n't my fault . 
ok . 
-- yes , we 're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in , believe it or not . 
the kind where there is n't really an answer . 
uh-oh . 
what was that boyfriend 's name ? 
let it go . 
turn in the car . clean my desk , explain things to our sons , then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss . 
are we here ? 
jon , it 's the tenth . i know how difficult it is for you , but we still have to go . 
you 're giving them to me ? 
you must get lonely . you ever think about , you know ... 
yeah ? like <person> <person> ? 
do n't you want to hear ? 
how did you know i would be here ? 
you knew ? all this time ? 
can i ask you something ? did n't you tell my dad you did n't think it was a good idea to come to the patient ? so what changed ? 
nice to see you , too . can i come in ? 
no , it 's not . <person> is virile , by the way . he was very good in ... chair . 
bullshit . that boat has n't made steam for fifty years . we found her . she 's ours . 
sure , i 'll try . 
yes and no ... 
yes . 
anything you can tell me might help . 
cop . 
it 's okay -- i 'll sit here . 
why did he go that way ? 
i do n't have the slightest fuckin ' idea what you 're talkin ' about . 
i ca n't believe he 'd do this . 
i did . 
i 'll keep streaking . pick me up . 
what , you gon na shoot me now , <person> ? 
i need you on this , <person> -- 
no ... i guess i would have gotten <person> to hit you . 
i said : do n't look . 
let him be guided not by my wishes and not by <person> 's wishes , although i am sure they are identical . let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself , because that is what has spoken through me tonight . 
you did n't kill her ? 
that does n't mean you do n't know what 's going on . you 're connected to this guy somehow . he 's after you -- just like the others were . 
you gon na nail the chief ? 
do n't you believe it . 
that is true , but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love . 
yes . 
this is <person> <person> film ? 
the hudsucker hoop ! 
the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr . <person> . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london does n't carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance . 
you do n't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic ? 
i 'll hate myself in the morning for asking , but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street ? 
out ! 
employed ? 
you want some bum in the bus terminal ? we 'll wait for a real call . 
hello , bomb . 
tanks , huh ? 
i do n't know . there 's a lot of space up here . they could be just about -- 
oh , okay . here 's let me show you . 
from the other side of the equator- 
connie . 
maybe i could bowl in japan . 
then talk about somethin ' you fuckin ' know about ... 
of course , sir . that explains it . <person> is a very good source of vitamin e . 
two-thirty-seven : `` ... and the descendants of japeth are these : <person> , <person> , hezekiah ... '' 
i called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow . 
what do you think my dad 's gon na do for you ? 
who ? 
prep the launcher now . 
oh . that . 
really ? - god , how time flies ! 
i 'll make this as simple as i can , <person> . they disappeared . 
i 'm sorry . <person> , <person> . i did n't think there was any danger . i 'm sorry . i love you . both of you . 
sure , everybody does . when i was a kid i 'd go with my sister twice a week . why ? were you an actor or something ? 
so ... wanta make love ? 
... not a single frayed collar or cuff , new haircuts , fresh shaves , clean hands - new shoe leather . look at the ear of the cop ... that 's a wire . what 's a cop wearing a headset for ? i think they 're actors , chief ; they 're not cops . 
you think so ? 
my lord ? 
slipped in . probably liked the scent of your perfume . 
ease up , ease up . <person> ! just tell me what ... . 
so are we . 
here 's what i 'm taking him in -- so he ca n't attack me again . 
blonde , beautiful , and sad -- and nowhere . of course she might have run away -- if she knew how . and where to go . she might have dyed her hair . bleached it before probably . and changed her name again . but look at this note . and look at her room in the hotel . her stuff is all there . has n't a rag except what she stood up in . you do n't run away like that . not if you are young and beautiful . no chance . 
no . i want to buy a dog . 
no . 
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering <person> around . 
the book said they have boats that are like taxis ... vaporettos . what 's the name of the place we 're staying again ? 
so , your parents ... why did you disappoint them ? 
that 's what we 're paid for . 
well , i ai n't upset about it , darlin ' . just give me an odd feelin ' there a minute , is all . 
i 'd love to sit in that jury . send that s.o.b . right to the chair . 
well ... 
go ahead and waste your time . 
but nothing is happening . 
onions ? 
all my model planes . 
and what happened to von der <person> ? 
what ... ? why ? 
but not all of it - not that <person> and i are going to be married . 
it 's the sequel . 
gimmie a minute . 
can it truly be used for magic ? 
you mean , you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword , and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ? 
we were n't sure we could trust you . 
it 's against my nature . 
that 's why you bombed the building . the infected firemen , the boy -- 
well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he 's starin ' at me with these narrow eyes . <person> ' me his mean face . 
i ... but i ... 
<person> schwimmer . the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan . 
<person> ? <person> 'i lost the truck ' <person> ? 
can you zoom it or something , make it real close , real big ? 
what do i want ? 
adele for god sake please lis ... 
yes -- quite easy . 
it 's monstrous -- it grew , like some horrible tapeworm . we were completely unprepared . 
we thought you was all broken up about <person> <person> . 
that 's not the point . 
do n't worry about that . guys away from home , lonely , good-hearted women try to cheer them up . 
because i told you , you 're the best . i knew you could do it but i could n't get you in here without a cover story . 
she wiped out her whole family . 
why not ? 
i 'd like to know what ... 
senator 's son ? 
i have nothing more to say . 
she 'll drive herself . 
no , no , you listen to me . all i wanted in this case is an even shake . you rushed me into court in <number> days ... my star witness disappears , i ca n't get a continuance , and i do n't give a damn . i 'm going up there and i 'm going to try it . let the jury decide . they told me sweeney he 's a hard-ass , he 's a defendant 's judge . i do n't care . i said , the hell with it . the hell with it . i 'll take my chances he 'll be fair . 
uh ... i think you scared them off . 
how are you ? having any luck ? 
why would n't it ? 
only rents by the month . <number> hundred and fifty for the <number> of them . 
<person> will be about . he 'll look after you . 
the red ... ? you 're totally gone , are n't you ? 
i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response . 
no , i think you 'll find i looked like he could have ? by accident even ? he 's up here spraying the scenery all day . 
just do n't worry about it . how we doin ' timewise ? 
<person> <person> , i 've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year . and i 've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me . i 'm too old to be an assistant anymore . i need to know this job is going someplace . 
i think we should have him in for a little talk . 
<person> <person> ... did you both meet already ? 
yes . 
mothafuck ... hey ! ! ! what the hell ! ! ! 
just <number> for a start . 
later . 
really ? 
read it yourself . 
ok ! 
common-law wife . on top of that , there 's a child . 
virgil , you wiener ! you never could stand up to fight . you -- 
alone ? 
now look more closely . look around the eyes and chin . see ? see there ? 
the multi-jurisdiction task force : read alphabet soup , for the continued pursuit , and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive , <person> <person> . the man 's hazing you . 
boy , this town . <person> gets around , does n't it ? 
you 're forgetting the check for your suitcase . it 's at the grand central . 
no . we 're friends . i wan na remain friends . 
umhummmmph . 
ready for another ? 
if it works again tomorrow , i 'll have a half <number> in cash here by noon the next day . we split 60-40 . 
you should ride the pony . it is not necessary to walk to prove the point . 
was that supposed to make me feel better ? 
then why do you come to me ? 
where you been , anyway ? 
hell , no . i hate lawyers . i just work for them . you got a minute ? 
i do n't know how he does n't know . he does n't know . 
his or ours ? 
and then what happened ? 
i 'm sorry , but it 's important . <person> <person> is important . i 'm sorry . 
'bout the same time i busted <person> i tried to nail this big-time dealer . i did n't have an id , but i was close . <person> close . gained the confidence of a badass named <person> . he was going to turn me onto the big man . he made me for a cop . mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser . 
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable ... 
vincent , come down . i 've found him . 
okay . 
there was no letter . 
you do not look like me . 
... what 's the long view ? 
that 's because it 's disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up <number> days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . great gag . 
yes . 
i 'm off it ! 
i 'm not sure . 
how ya been , wash ? been what , twelve , thirteen year'n ? 
i 'm so afraid ... ... you wo n't let it happen ... 
<person> ? 
why not ? i 'm going to have her for a lifetime . 
bullshit ? i 'll give you bullshit -- there 's a dead whale out there with bites all over it ! 
i warned them , <person> . i told them to leave us alone . 
good . 
not enough to be a pro . 
do you think he could hack a gibson ? 
i 'm only trying to help him , <person> . 
stick ? 
take it now . 
<person> . my figures work out exactly the same as <person> 's . <number> for <person> , <number> for <person> . 
llewelyn would never ask for help . he never thinks he needs any . 
joel , you 're a liar . 
watch me . 
-- i do n't fucking know what chance you fucking have ! 
and you need your sleep . 
not necessarily . 
that 's why we 're turning off onto a fire road . 
i 'm not interested in your literary recommendations . 
but i got you out . did n't i , <person> . i did it . i got you out . 
no thanks , i do n't smoke . 
those are for trusties , unless you got thirty cents or <number> packs of cigs . 
i , uh ... thanks . 
the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work . do n't ask me to explain it . i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction . after it 's over , the planet will be unlivable for generations . 
i did n't realize you and <person> were so fond of each other . 
because i want justice . i want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong . and i want to have a little fun . 
obeah evil . i not evil . 
the gun ? it 's in the upstairs closet . 
so i stay . stay until i hustle up enough to play <person> again . maybe by that time i 'll develop myself some character . 
here . i 'll do it . 
you do n't believe me , see for yourself . 
ca n't we really go home ? i ca n't breathe . are n't you dying for green , anything green , or rain , would n't you die to feel rain on your face ? it 's <person> and it 's all - i do n't know - if you asked me i 'd go home tomorrow . if you wanted . 
look if you think you know how , why do n't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages , put out a product , support me for a while ! 
well <person> and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen . 
no ! 
i wan na see this ... where is he , do you know ? 
we need help . we deserve help . 
why ? 
what is this `` i , i , i '' stuff ? you only talk about yourself ? are n't you glad to see me ? do n't i look nice ? 
not without you ! ! ! 
for about <number> year . 
back it up , rewind , whatever you call it . 
just how easy is it to build a ... device ? 
that 's right . 
are you glad ? i 'm glad . 
why , that 's ridiculous . you just ... 
it is . 
how many men are working with you on this ? 
i 'm sure we can match any offer .

he 'll get over it . 
yeah , but if you heard this band called the crumblers , you 'd -- 
i 'm just saying , not in this particular case . 
<number> more turns and your neck will break . 
it lends you an air of mystery . 
he -- 
what do those ghosts want when they talk to you ? think real careful now , cole ... 
alison . 
we know . 
<person> got any ? 
you said that in the last <number> places . 
i can just imagine , being around so much money all the time ... 
i guess i miss the waves and my board most of all . 
he should 've have killed the virus in the incubation area..nyah 's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab . 
bogey at <number> o'clock high ! nose on ! 
yeah ! seniority gets the day shift . 
whatever you say , <person> . 
what is this , a poll ? 
but here you are inside , are n't you ? 
not likely , reggie . maybe i just need some help . 
he does . 
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you . 
i 'm not fucking with <person> . that shit-kicker would kill us dead , baby . just like <person> <person> 
hear voices do n't i . 
no , i 'm not . 
shut up , <person> . 
what can i tell you ? it 's a healthier lifestyle down here , and it 's easier to succeed when your head 's clear . those guys i worked with back in boston , they were a bad influence . 
okay , sucker . 
yes , but does n't that ruin everything for you ? that makes everything ... 
so how 's it going with your new roomie ? what 's her name ? 
the navy 's conclusion regarding the crash of an f-14 aboard an aircraft carrier . <person> aviator , it just so happens . you 're familiar with this report and its conclusion , am i right ?

why are we stopping ? 
i 'll drive you --

tomorrow ? 
so ... if the hull 's impregnable why are my feet wet ? 
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .

and now i am back . 
and how 's the diva doing ? 
alright ... 
we should n't have been here , <person> . there is a war going on !

do n't tell me what to do ! we 're divorced -- i 'm a free woman . you 're not my husband and you 're not my boss ! and what 's more , you 're not going to be my boss . 
... keep them from that area , on grounds of relevancy . what , <person> ? 
a mark , huh ? 
dorothy ! <person> ! we 're busy ! 
do it , or look for another profession . that 's a choice i guess .

that 's what you were talking about yesterday ? everybody does that in the future ? 
thank you , sir . 
agnes , how did your mother get you ? 
for the love of god . not spanish again . who 's the girl ? 
i think he 's a sick fuckin ' maniac ! we 're awful goddamn lucky he did n't tag us , when he shot up the place . i came this fucking close - to taking his ass out myself . everybody panics . when things get tense , everybody panics . everybody . i do n't care what your name is , you ca n't help it . it 's human nature . but ya panic on the inside . ya panic in your head . ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic , then you get a grip and deal with the situation . what you do n't do , is shoot up the place and kill everybody . 
that 's okay , <person> . you 're doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ? 
why are you doing all this ? to impress me ? 
and it ai n't pretty ... '' the ad has spent more than $ <number> on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november , <number> .

i said , i ai n't got you ... 
why do n't you stay here tonight ? get a good sleep . you can return to your command in the morning .

i do n't think i will , <person> . 
i 'm a schoolboy - teach me , teach me . 
i really wanted you to call me , and i thought you were never going to -- 
how many girls did you molest ?

megan , do you ever remember me getting sick ?

england does not protect me and does not war against france on our account . she uses us to war against france on her own account ... of greed for land and furs .

help , help us . 
how long will it take to receive them all ? 
do n't worry . through me , you will live forever ... 
now that 's cool .

do n't hurry back . 
she should 've known better . 
i know , but you pick on the <number> time in my life i like not to remember . i was in the bad lands . really not well . it 's something that happens to a lota cops . we do n't wan na talk about that . 
easy , tiger . come by after school . i 'll leave <person> with the sitter . 
<person> died here .

<person> killers . <person> machines . build in automated factories . most of us were rounded up , put in camps ... for orderly disposal . 
<person> <number> got canceled , so i stopped home and brought you some lunch .

in the back . down the other corridor . 
you could n't . you 've never been out there , you said . 
where 's that ? 
somebody throw a tent over this circus . 
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you were n't saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road . 
i 'm tellin ' you the truth , dammit . i found her beat . <person> for dead . so i brung her home . 
actually he never told us what it was . 
i mean , you can play . you 're okay . 
do n't you like <person> <person> ? 
of course . i simply love the ... naturalness of it all . 
i 'm making < u > you < /u > nervous . i 'm the one with a schedule . 
it would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing . 
i knew it , < <person> > he < /u > started it , i should have known . 
well , those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning , but they took <number> look at that picket line and turned tail . 
maybe . do n't mush it . 
in a word ? lucrative . 
-- yeah , the goddamn stoners ! who you think stole the stuff ! ? 
i do n't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight , <person> . it 's these clouts below the belt i ca n't take . sicking that horrible dame on him -- when he 's goofy about her -- 
<person> . 
i thought that , too -- but i found that it does . come along , dance with <person> . 
tom . you remember ? 
-- the phones , theo . do n't leave any of them behind . the cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you . 
no . no , it do n't . i ca n't do that . i ca n't let m'self . all i can do is see how soon they gon na wanta eat again . they 'd all get upset if i done anymore 'n that . they all depen ' on me jus ' thinkin ' about that . that 's my part -- that an ' keepin ' the fambly together . 
i do n't give a shit about living or dying anymore . i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can . 
why do they call you <person> ? 
why not ? it 's charming . i mean , i do n't actually show concubines exposing their ! their ! it 's not indecent ! it 's highly moral , <person> . it 's full of proper german virtues . i swear it . absolutely ! 
why ? 
<person> , twenty-eight bucks is nothing . the only way to do it is through your uncle ... think about it will you ? 
no ... it was me . and i 'm sorry mom , really , ju ... just tell me what to do , i 'll do anything . 
the streamers ? they 're no problem , you just pull on them and -- 
christ , <person> , let 's wait for the hose team ... 
nothing to resolve , ian . <person> 's get a drink . 
but a good strange . 
the biggest . the biggest movie you 've ever dealt with , <person> . we 're talkin ' a lot of film . a man 'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that . and <person> , you 're no idiot . 
trickery and flummery or not , she 's going there tomorrow on the bus ! it 's settled ! and i must say we 've been more than fair to you , <person> , it 's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that ! 
the boys at school do n't think i am . 
certainly , outside . all the best homes have 'em outside . 
that 's <number> thing the theatre has in great store . which reminds me . i have something else for you ... 
stop what ? 
just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life . 
you made a choice once . do you think you would make that same choice again ? 
lucy . 
i 'd die for her . 
you 're not going to tell me that . 
i guess it would be pretty awkward . 
why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at <number> at night ? are you going to show it to someone ? 
that 's right . 
<person> <number> which <number> . 
not so fast ! slower ... 'blonde , thin ' , yes ... did they say she had style ? a kind of grace or anything ? 
yes , i suppose that 's true . 
it may not be that simple . this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history . 
you 're breathin ' right now . 
i do n't < u > want < /u > to be <person> <person> anymore , no matter < u > how < /u > much i like chocolate . i want to be a stud . 
what , want a glass ? 
if he 's not dead , he 'll keep coming back . 
not her brand . 
your house must have been a zoo . 
oh , you idiot ! you 're a toy ! use your karate chop action ! 
there 's only seventy-eight . 
every guy has a type ! 
what are your rates ? 
hey , dad . what 's up ? 
the others are called <person> , t- bird . <person> names . <person> . watch me , office <person> . 
debbie , think back ! i 'm <person> ... remember ? remember how i used to let you ride my horse ? tell you stories ? do n't you remember me , <person> ? 
[ uncertainly ] in that thing ... the jacket . 
when you saw dr. lecktor 's murders , their 'style , ' so to speak , were you able to reconstruct his fantasies ? and did that help you identify him ? 
i did n't know what else to do ... 
nothing . what were you going to say ? 
keep the animal quiet . 
you should go in . you 're risking your life again ... 
fish ? 
you do n't drink `` booze '' . 
words ! while you 've been dickin ' around at fucking company golf tournaments , i been out in the world , giving my word and backing it up with action . 
in fact it 's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs . a completely successful fabrication of the past , the ploughman 's <person> was . 
why not ? 
find 'em ! 
<number> ca n't just leave - please . 
how much is your soul worth if you do n't ? 
what do they want me to do ? 
we wo n't . 
what ? ... why ? 
<person> ! why call when we can go ? 
a mistake ? to assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the chattanooga river and single- handedly trapped <person> 's entire cavalry ? how is that a mistake ? 
this has nothing to do with me -- but always remember , purser , when you 're searching anybody , take the lining of their coat , like this -- -- run your fingers all along these seams ... . then -- back of the collar -- < u > here < /u > -- that used to be a favorite trick -- and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe -- like this . 
maybe you should see a psychiatrist . 
daddy ... 
what if you 're wrong ? no -- i 'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you ca n't deny the possibility -- and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly ... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks . 
madame has changed her mind . she 'll be down in a minute . 
nobody . 
<person> ' off <person> was my idea , but these guys , man , they 're into shit i ca n't handle . 
you < u > need < /u > a doctor . 
there are <number> of them . could n't make them out . the orange glow of a cigarette . 
i guess . 
this is taking forever . i 'm starving . 
yeah , but some of the things they say your brothers 've done ... 
it 's an easy game . we ask you a question . if you get it wrong -- you die . 
you gentlemen going to stay for lunch ? 
only part . what else ? what did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because joan of <person> told him to do it . 
would not say no , would not say no . 
bullshit . 
yeah ? 
i do not want <person> <person> disturbed ! you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man . use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of <person> <person> , if you run into problems , alert <person> . i 'll be in the office at <number> in the morning and i would like to have it at that time . i 've got to take a leak . 
tell that to <person> ... and his wife and kid . 
the dead get out ? 
it 's the tension . 
and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists ? <number> 
what else could 've done that ? 
what ... ? 
oh - look out . 
it 's beautiful . 
not another lecture ! on guard ! 
nothing 's private ... 
and what was that ? 
commander , sir , we have a big problem . you see , the veil nebula bomb , <person> <person> <number> , is stuck . it wo n't drop from the bomb bay . it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in -- -- less than eleven minutes . 
we need a sympathetic face . 
nice meeting you , too , <person> . 
ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now ! 
what did n't you like about her ? 
that 's okay . i love you anyway . 
some kind of mutation ... ? 
just stay back . 
then it happened before they scuttled her . 
yes , i 'm very hungry . 
yeah , that 's what happened ... 
well ... you 're looking well . 
i know , <person> . 
iris ? 
maybe he really is <person> . he could still be alive . 
do n't joke about such things . 
i guess so . thank you , <person> . 
you see , that 's worse . 
listen , i do n't know what 's going on or how you got mixed up with him , but do n't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ? 
i 'm sorry , <person> <person> . but <person> 's in st. lukes now , so i 'm a little -- i 'm not myself . the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth 's offer , it 'll only get worse . 
drive while you thinking ; i wan na get to the city this month ! 
it might have been more . might have been positively grand talk . 
int . ice cream truck/cab - dawn . 
we do not want your tired and sick . 
that was nineteen years ago , and they were simple gambling pinches . 
i would n't worry about that . 
not someone . something . i 've never felt a presence that strong before . 
do i ? 
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ? 
hey . 
what <person> 's trying to say isâ€”wellâ€”we need you , <person> <person> . there were a lot of us did n't believe what that man said . 
magic . 
hey , at least it 's not <person> . 
but there 's <number> thing . the desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious . i mean -- i do n't know what their policy is -- but -- 
how many sharks have you killed ? 
you tell me your name , i 'll tell you mine . 
yes ... 
i do n't mind him ... but i do think it 's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup . 
oh , <person> . this is n't about money . it 's about decency and purity . it 's about <person> 's values . 
did you just propose to me ? 
what sort of danger ? 
we 'd better get back downstairs asap . 
the police do n't know that . and it 's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck . i 'll take you as far as california . if we can even make that . after that i 'm cutting you loose . 
it was . what sadness lengthens <person> 's hours ? '' 
<number> . you had <number> leads . <number> kicked out , <number> the judge , you say ... 
all right . <person> . i'11 ... see you . 
we 're finding it . <person> , < u > please < /u > -- you 've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed , computers inoperative ... 
killaine ... 
you 're not a dipsomaniac at your age ? 
sure can . i 'd like an invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel . 
grace the dispatcher . <person> . 
we 've got to do something to make this boy 's voice change . i wonder if we could n't get bull balls somewhere , and fry 'em up . still miss your mother ?

no . that 's her second cousin . who 's married to li'l bit . 
i said with the mouth shut . 
louise ... no matter what happens , i 'm glad i came with you . 
oh no . 
yeah , but the game 's not over until it 's over . 
yeah , well -- 
mary -- you 've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and i believe he wants me to help you a little . you see , sometimes we think we 're licked in this life -- but we were n't put here to be licked . do n't you believe it . sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight . now i was thinking before you came , of coming over to <person> <person> end of the month , to get acquainted with my godson -- and other things . 
why not just shoot <person> coming up <person> ? there 's plenty of time - he 's out in the open - a frontal shot ? 
well you can understand why we did n't say anything . if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us . 
name 's pritchett . <person> <person> . i own the house , my father built it . and now i just need to get you into it . so ... 
i think so ... what do you think ? 
and you will come to hear us tonight ? 
anyway , it 's just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry . 
no . 
we 're not chasing trucks , we 're chasing evidence -- 
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . is n't she ? 
no shit . 
do n't waste your time , <person> . the guy 's not much of a movie fan . now c'mon , gim me the key . 
you want something to drink ? 
yeah -- when you 're sixteen . 
just considering our options ... sir .

i hope you do n't think me daft . it 's important work . it 's part of a larger sociological experiment . i 'm federally funded . 
yeah . i 'm probably not going to be around next time it comes . 
i do n't care . 
feed store keeps up to <number> k in their safe . need me a good boy for back-up . even split . you interested ? 
make me forget it , baby . 
you enjoying yourself , <person> ? 
what ? 
the hutu-tutsi thing . the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords . and the u.n. wants the banquet room for that day , a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony . can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish ? 
even better . <person> call your station , tell 'em we 're going live a little early today . make it happen ! 
why not ? 
you 're a fast mover . 
<person> straight , it is . i got my own set of keys because i 'm supposed to open up . so if i ai n't there <number> a.m. monday morning , there 's gon na be hell to pay .

the c.i . what ? god , no ... 
no , it was more than that . it was very generous of you . it was very kind . 
today 's april <number> . <number> never comes to school on april <number> . 
i know a lot of nice girls . 
who are you ? 
how am i gon na do that ? 
i do n't know . just should , though . somebody should kill 'em . nobody 'd miss 'em . 
i know . 
fine . i 'll say no . 
no . look . there . 
apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself . entirely too much like myself . do you follow so far ? 
do you think that 's a good idea ? 
load it for her . 
and you did n't know her last name ? 
and if it ai n't cleaned off ? 
no ... i 'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead . oh no ... i ripped my dress . where are we anyway ? 
when ? after you get all drunk and loaded ? 
you got a maiden name , <person> ? 
hollywood . 
for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team , you sure got a big mouth , <person> . 
well , let 's call her up . what can we lose ? 
my daddy gave me this watch . 
they put the heat on , my man , just like you 're doing . i gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza . <person> is , i never met the dude . 
well , the evening is still young . let 's go down to the living room and talk it over . it 's only ten o'clock . 
i am delighted ; any chance to go aboard <person> , however briefly , is always an excuse for nostalgia . 
i always loved that mute broad that <person> <person> was shacking up with . 
if what you 're saying is true , then why would he have killed <number> police officers ? a man like that would want to lay low , if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission ! 
you ask too many questions . you want the surprise or not ? 
oh , shit . take your time ! do n't get suckered ! this man is a murderer ! in his career he 's killed over a thousand gladiators . <person> , just take the fall ! 
but <person> also took orders . and when he was told to give a pension fund loan to <person> <person> ... 
that you were jealous , and he was worried about what you might do . 
you should be . he lied to you . so did <person> . 
lyssa ? < u > why < /u > ? 
dropped it . 
why me ? 
damn it , look at you ! do n't you see what 's happening with you ? we need to get out of here , do n't you understand ? out of this house ! 
why ? 
no problem . 
<number> ... i can take care of myself . i grew up in a tough neighbourhood , and i 've handled some pretty rough customers in my day . <person> <person> does n't scare me . <number> ... i 'm a journalist , and i 'm prepared to take that risk . <number> ... it ai n't gon na happen . believe me when i tell you , it is in mickey knox 's own best interest to play this game according to hoyle . wait a minute . we 've gotten into a advisory relationship here , which is not what i want . but seriously , <person> , look at this . 
frank ? 
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo . i work for an insurance company . so , i decided to take a few days off . i do n't know this island at all . it really is gorgeous . 
i was telling your wife , we have a very good case here . 
i do n't know . i was just curious . 
let me put it this way then ; the photographs and the man ? <number> and the same , man , <number> and the same . at best fucking weird , at worst fucked-up fucking weird . maybe you should think yourself lucky . some folks just ain â€™ t worth getting involved with . and <person> sure is <number> of â€˜ em . 
i 'm glad you told me . good night , <person> <person> . 
`` closed , closed , closed . '' but with your music .

you mean when are you going to egypt ? 
did they charge him with anything ? 
oh i see . that again . <person> ? i realize it must be hard . but <person> how long does it take someone to move on ? 
you believe that ? 
yes -- why ? 
not at all . your highness , may i present <person> <person> ? 
you lived there . you know the city . 
... i 'm glad that 's ... 
i represent the interests of the corleone family . we make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by monday morning . 
i like that . but take care , <person> <person> . <person> is a drug , much like any other . too much can be a very bad thing . 
it was n't a joke . 
i-i can do the job , sir . 
then make them suffer as she suffers . how much shall i pay you . 
i do not agree . although you share the same genetic structure , the events of your life have created unique individual . 
only if you promise not to return me . 
i did n't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor . <person> . look at me . what do i have this afternoon ? 
you 're a caterer ? 
well i 'm sorry . before ... 
i 'm coming with you .

<person> <person> <person> over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while i sort this lot out .

conflict , honey . <person> <person> . 
well , it 's okay . i 'll use the service entrance . i 'll see you at <number> . 
my readings indicate great instability . 
remember me ? we were in a disaster together . 
do n't count on it . we better take him out . 
i do n't want to leave you . 
we all do . but now i understand you 're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we 're all expecting . 
what d'you mean ? 
< i > mr . <person> ? < /i > 
i worked with spearchucker my first month over here , at the <number> evac in taegu . most of the colored guys know who he is but they 're not talking because he asked them not to . 
i want you to use all your powers , all your skill , as you love me . i do not want his mother to see him as he is . 
like me , it has been designed with modular power sources . 
so i can move on . you too . 
yes sir . i sure am . 
so where is it then ? 
right . 
anybody who 'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb . 
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty . 
considering where i 've been ... 
yes , sir . 
let 's hear your reasons , mrs. <person> . because i think i know what they are . 
yes . 
i need to take back what 's mine .

we 're going all the way on this <number> , frank . tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder <number> -- fifteen to twenty <number> . 
what good ? wladek , i 'm surprised at you . they died with dignity , that 's what good it did . and you know something else ? now the poles will rise . we 're ready . we 'll fight , too . you 'll see . 
oh , yes . absolutely . <person> . unquestionably !

i do n't care . 
you 're damn lucky , glimpsing this country before it 's ruined , gone for good . you saw wonders you 'd only dreamed of . that alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from , because you have dreamt them .

we 're going to need everyone . 
my job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be . 
damn right i 'm done . i 'm going to ask for a mistrial and i 'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . i 'm going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass . 
initiating connection . 
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa . 
it 's not something for nothing , <person> , i took you in on this , you have to go . that 's your thing . i 've made the deal with <person> . i ca n't go . i ca n't go in , i 've spoken on this too much . i 've got a big mouth . `` the fucking leads '' et cetera , blah blah blah `` ... the fucking tight ass company ... ''

at sioux falls pen ? 
<person> ? 
gripping . it 's not <person> <person> , it 's not <person> <person> , but it 's gripping . 
absolutely . the audience will stain their drawers . i did . 
it 's not a contest . 
it 's because of <person> â€”â€” i ca n't go on looking for her -- 
mmmerrick . 
i could not think of not accepting . 
let 's just say that i am out to make some radical changes . now come on <person> . for old times sake , for your sake ... leave him to me . 
... stole the truck . 
i do n't think i 've ever spent this much time with someone who did n't even ask my name . 
no kidding . no kidding ! 
no ! captain rob is <number> feet tall , wears an eye patch , got a hook for a hand ... 
i never want to go back ... . 
when was the last time you washed your hair ? 
the first one was , but the rest sucked . 
raus ! raus ! all of you ! 
what i should have done a long time ago . applications and patents , <person> . this all belongs to me . 
no . i went back to the hotel . and waited . 
it 's against my programming to impersonate a deity . 
he wanted to know if i liked fried chicken . 
well , let 's help them with that . take the legs . 
never happened ! 
oh , it was ... really weird . but she 's a very nice woman . 
do n't tell me you 're sorry .

it 's beginning ... . 
huh ? 
goodbye , <person> . 
i have acted as i think fit . 
it will ... take me from < u > you < /u > ... 
it was just like before , was n't it ? was n't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing <number> people to get the <number> you 're after , this time there was only <number> other person involved . 
i should shit or get off the pot . 
they do n't know that . what are they gon na do , try and shoot the president during the interview ? i 'll bet <person> can pull some strings . you saw the way she was staring at me .

i do n't know . i have n't decided yet . 
what happend to you ? 
it is . only the poorest families ever ate it . we kept ours in a crockery jar . 
<person> english , then !

well ... the red bra . 
no , its -- why did she -- ? 
that 's impossible . 
yeah , too bad . they were real nice lookin ' too ... in bed together , hardly any clothes <number> watching tv ...

my dreams died long ago .

how 'd she sound ? was she doin ' okay ?

ingen is my livelihood , dr. <person> , and i will jealously defend its interests . people will know what i want them to know when i want them to know it .

are you aimin ' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus ' fellas -- campin ' here ? 
what ? what do you remember about that -- dumper ? 
who cares about people ? 
<person> sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side . 
dr. lester , would you point me toward the restroom ? 
for how long ? and why ? 
i do n't care what they 're doing as long as they 're doing it way over there . 
i 'm very cold . 
here 's your money . 
huh ? absolutely . take your time . 
to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he 'll testify ? 
oh , hey man , how are ya ? i wondered if i 'd see you again . 
c.r.s . who do you think ? <person> <person> , thank your lucky charms . to think what i almost got you into . 
yes , sir . 
if she comes down here , so help me i 'm gon na mash her brains in . everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her . since then , forget it . 
thank you . 
we need to put together a meet for the whole country . we all got the same problems . we could talk . meet the guys we do n't know . lift a few with the guys we do . 
mom , this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . the guy you yelled at for no good reason ... 
and then we 'll exchange phone numbers and you 'll leave and never call and i 'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch . why am i putting myself through this ? it was very nice ... uh meeting you . good night.. 
that bad , huh ? 
yeah . what vibe ? 
do n't yell at her ! 
'swell . ' when was the last time i heard anybody say - where are you from , anyway ? 
i think if you tried livin ' in a town like this , instead of running free and easy , you 'd soon change your tune . 
i ca n't call it off . he 's not responding . get out of my way . 
almost . 
i ca n't lose him , can you get off a shot ? 
on the instant . everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you . 
what ? 
wait . 
why would you help me ? 
no , you 're awake , <person> , and i 'm dead serious . and we 're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from <number> years ago . how did you find out <person> <person> drove to texas that day ? 
whose show was this on ? 
you best leave that quilt alone . that was grandma 's quilt . 
tell me about <person> . 
i do n't believe you . 
that 's a wasp . fuckers 'll sting a tree if they 're bored- so - where is she ... ? 
i 'm here . 
you are n't , by any chance , pre-law ? are you ? 
maybe . 
you ca n't leave 'em to do the same to other girls . you should get rid of them . 
i will -- i assure you that -- you got a fifty on that h-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- i 'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em -- 
if you need a minute , that 's okay . but i thought you 'd want to -- 
what 's my problem ? yeah , i got ta problem . i got ta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot ! 
no . <person> . 
jesus ... i 'm glad <person> got us together . you know , she 's got a great instinct for people . really . 
i told you - my manager was a total asshole ! do n't worry , i 'm going to get another job ... and anyway , i have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime ... 
what is it ? why , it 's a toothbrush ! thanks . youâ€”you had it pressed . 
i did n't mean to ! 
-- no way -- 
no , thanks , i can manage . 
your father must be smart . 
hit a couple of jazz clubs . <person> back to her place . 
well , i have this very pleasant room on <person> <person> -- and i 've been getting to some classes -- 
no . you 'll have to get somebody else . 
no . 
my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles . it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth . 
wha ... ? 
what about the obvious remedy ? reversing things . maybe getting a job on a newspaper . 
no , it 's not . now i get to pitch . 
it 's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing . it 's kinda cool . it 's like you 're in on some kind of secret . you tell a chick you 've been some place , it 's like bragging that you know how to find it . the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there . you have to have someone come before . there is a direct line connecting you back to the original , unequivocally cool , club patrons . it 's kinda like <person> ... 
nope . 
i want to find them too , but we ca n't do a bit of good right now . for every scary thing we saw in the daylight , i 'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night . am i right ? 
<person> had some ideas about the fire and ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs ... i think they 're kind of interesting . 
this ai n't permanent . my friend <person> 's working on a cure ... i think . 
... something like that . 
the agents -- 
that 's why her mother could n't i.d . her ... jesus fucking <person> . 
what is wrong with us ? ... we have everything . 
my bags are out there in that white cadillac convertible . can you have someone drive it around to the room ? 
put down the gun and i 'll take your statement . <person> ? 
[ ask for <person> . eight days from tonight , exactly <number> a.m. be there if you dare . you can not fool the murman . ] 
i would love to see you again sometime . 
we were talking about the wild thing . teen promiscuity . 
oh . well , i do n't . shall i tell you what i do ? 
i 'm vince . 
i ca n't stand it . oh god , i ca n't stand it ! 
that 's right . 
mmmmmmorning ... . 
what 's the difference ? 
right . <person> , then . shall we go ? 
we 're in love . 
i can show you how to use a slide rule . 
that 's right . 
i 'm not in danger . i have a dead bolt . remember ? 
i also know that you 're an aging tv reporter slash writer who , despite huge tabloid success , has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner . a coupla failed relationships with -- i 'm guessing balding , older men -- have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone . but i bet sometimes , late at night , when you 're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled . 
that what you got me up here for ? 
neither can i . 
in the abstract maybe . get a grip on yourself ! but when i imagine you going out with other guys , i feel ... ah ... 
you 've been through it . that 's how you love people . when it 's easy for you , when it 's convenient for you . 
yes ... i remember ... 
no , no , no ! i disagree with you completely ! i tried it once -- 
i 'm sorry . 
<person> ? i 'm sorry about ... what 's happened to you . it 's a fucking kick in the head . 
do you love me ? 
i ca n't believe you made it ! 
stuff you can never imagine . feelings . big thoughts . and love . yeah . i 'm inclined to parlay it into somethin ' more . so , go ahead there , beautiful , and take off your shirt . 
and what is your present salary ? 
i do n't care . i hate him . 
here we are . <person> and blue receipts . all you 've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque . 
that proletarian ! in the old days we 'd have had her flogged . 
we could - 
wait just a second there . you sent him here . you unearthed this pestilence . 
anouk is n't like a dog , really . more like a small person . so is there anyone here for me ? no one looks new . who 's that ? 
who is he ? 
too much . 
i 'm telling you ... 
i grant you , it 's a little odd , shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it , but it was hers , all right . it really is your mother , <person> <person> . 
we 'll , them ohio amish sure must be different . our lancaster brethren , they just do n't have that kind of fight in them . 
that 's my girl . done . 
after a month of it you 'd think i 'd be used to it . 
now look , boy , get a grip on yourself . rose had a good life . she found her . <person> , did n't she ? she triumphed over everything , what are you blubbering about ? 
are the horses stragglin ' or are n't they ? 
hell , no . i boosted a 'vette . 
mom , please do n't start that again ... . 
they 're from out of state . <person> 's an engineer at the nuclear power plant . i really do n't know much about them . 
she has the power of vision . 
she < u > is < /u > -- she 's helped solve a bunch of murders : <person> , new mexico -- 
there must be a passage to that other ocean . 
well , if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo , we might stand a chance , but not against those tanks . 
as the trucks go . 
no . 
why ? 
you find this amusing , do you ? 
well ... they told me that i was an accomplice ... 
why do you think ? 
yeah . i guess . you know -- 
we 'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco , but we do n't like the look of that sky . looks like a bad day coming ... does n't it . 
no , i was . 
vitamins will it be then ? 
because your body can only take so much of what they 're putting you through . 
what ? where was he ? ! 
to what ? 
you did n't give that boy all your money ? 
virginia ? ! 
i do n't own this place . the man who does stuck me with <person> . 
want me to come back some other time ? 
never mind . <person> . every night people are laughing at your beloved fuhrer . why ? 
but are there ... i mean , how many ... 
is he really that big a sap ? 
try <number> and a half . at first i totally did n't like him . 
but then we knew that all along , did n't we ... 
no , no , no ... i love my husband . 
i thought redding had like <number> balls ! 
pray he 's color-blind ... 
thanks . 
how do i reach him ? 
no . just plain ol ' <person> . now you can fuckin ' take it or you can fuckin ' leave it . 
oh , i hate the other kind . 
i just could n't stand seeing him again . 
-- but she was nicer then -- sweeter -- she had n't vomited twice already like today -- 
had a package to deliver . 
i 'll get <person> . 
it looks fine . 
she 'll be awright . 
the federal agent kinda half hinted <person> might of done <person> . 
i got fifty dollars to spend in your store , <person> of nazareth . can you help me or not ? 
i do n't care . 
i 'll make it an even <number> hundred . plus an extra <number> if you get me to lax on time . 
he kept it in the side table in the front hallway . he showed me . i visited a few times . then <number> of <person> 's guys visited . when i arrived , your dad was dying . 
i 'm serious . we forget he 's just a child . i wish you 'd speak to him . 
if i had n't tried , the cost would have been my soul . 
who signed as his `` sponsoring officer '' ? 
yes ... i ... yes . 
just a moment ago ... did n't you hear the sound of a motor ? 
i 'm a deserter . 
oh , yes . give them a flower and they 'll follow you anywhere . 
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit , and those who refuse to quit i will kill . you ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir , yes , sir ! 
i promise . 
yeah . 
i would 've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint . curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off . you were in such a hurry to knock off that <number> , you never figured out where the virus really was . 
yes ! 
you told him that ? 
when in doubt , pull the yellow wire . 
george is a fucking burnout case . i did n't want him on the stand anyway . get more names from <person> . 
settle down . i have a plan which i think will work . there is very little for you to do , but i do need your help . .are n't you curious about my plan ? 
we do n't know that 's true , he never said that . 
it 's just ... you 've been acting kinda strange , you know ? 
he 's very interesting . for all his pretending to be a tough guy , he 's really got the soul of a poet . 
it 's going to sonora . 
well , armed , then . <person> 's been hurt . release the hostages , nobody is gon na worry over kidnapping charges , the worst you 're gon na get is <number> years -- you can be out in a year . 
i do n't get it . if it 's the first of its kind , how can it be pregnant ? 
madame . 
when 's <person> picking you up ? 
here , hold up ! 
you do n't know . i 'm sorry . i was desperate . that 's not me . i shot a cop . can you imagine what they 'll do to me when i got to prison ? 
aye . and it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here . i entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow , most lovely of the lovely . 
where <person> ? 
how ? 
i do n't know , like i said , she 's not my father 's case . 
twenty-five . 
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date , you never asked me out ? 
have a seat . 
then why do n't you testify ? 
delly ? in here . 
i 've got medical supplies to deliver . come along to the hospital when you 're done . 
i never felt better . 
light to super-middleweight , as my body developed . you go about what , bantam ? 
what 's it look like ? they want a piece of me they can come and get it , i 'm not crawlin ' into my hole . 
do n't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion , that in fact , you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require ? you trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and , of course , we are obliged to place the same trust in you . 
too flashy ... they 'll clash with the new outfits . 
oh , <person> ... oh , my god ... 
talk away , professor . 
yes , sir ! 
yah , not too bad . so it 's nice up there ? 
hi . 
of course . 
... miles . 
no . they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices . the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there . <person> is where the bodies were found . but that 's the thing ... 
clothes . 
yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday . 
nothing 's changed . you know , we never finished that gin game -- 
funny , you do n't look hip . 
like a stroke ? 
okay . 
so i borrowed it till i did know ! 
no , sweetie , not yet . 
she 's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning . 
praying . 
you feel i 've done a dreadful thing -- leaving him ? 
you 've got to get back on the horse some time . look , you 've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls . i know how scary that feels . 
no , lieutenant , your men are already dead . 
you just told me to fuck off . that was n't good . you 're dead . 
ah , love again . 
yeah . but i -- 
yes , <person> . you were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to . 
i really think i should try and locate it immediately . <person> be something important . 
right . but , that 's not the biggest problem . <number> of our intel officers picked up information from dea that traffickers have come up with a process , a chemical process , to turn coke into something else . it does n't smell like coke . it does n't look like coke . and what 's worse , it does n't react to field test . it could be anything . maybe it 's already happening . i mean , how would we know ? 
something to sharpen us up , you especially . we have the start . 
i did n't learn <person> because we were getting shipped here . you do n't learn it in a couple of weeks . i studied it in high school . 
from your mouth ta <person> 's ear . 
ca n't pass up another chance to play hero , can you . 
yes . 
love at first sight ? 
it 's true . a newspaper is paying for all this . a newspaper ... 
that 's right . 
he 's gon na die ! they 'll kill him ! 
sarah , we could take off and leave this guy behind ... 
that 's home . 
it 's time for me to leave it behind . 
i really would n't know , you see <person> takes care of that . 
she came to me for help , she needed money , and i did n't help her . i did n't help her . now she 's dead and it 's my fault . 
what 's that ? 
please calm down . 
oh yeah ? why do n't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ? 
me neither . who was the boy she was talking about , <person> ? 
good good . 
i do n't know , but whatever it is , it 's not the crew . 
it 's not going to happen . 
you watch that smart-mouthing , young lady . 
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i . but if victory is remote and there 's any hope for a negotiated peace , we must keep this army intact . 
do you have any particular choice of girl ? 
that 's not what they 're tellin ' me . 
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway . 
okay , kid , i have a deal for you ! if you want out of hell , all you have to do is collect <number> proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores . ' they 're rich , chocolatey and really hit the spot . bring me ten proofs of purchases and we 'll grant you any wish you want . 
uh-huh . 
perhaps he is not all he says he is . 
right through those doors . the man himself . 
no . 
i do n't think this is any time to be funny ... 
el paso . 
please do n't tell me `` you 'll find somebody else someday . '' cause . . . . . . well , you are a pretty hard act to follow , you 'll have to admit that . oh , i 'll get by , do n't worry about me . 
i want a child . 
he just fell asleep . <person> 's with him . 
it takes so many things to make love last . most of all it takes respect . and i ca n't live with a man i do n't respect ! 
we find the man and then we dissect him- 
why not ? 
everybody except the girl who 's supposed to handle the kitchen . <person> . 
i said that ? 
do you want an argument or an answer ? 
once you 're in the car with me she 's sure to come to us . 
when we were up poking around his place ... i found this ... 
with that <number> <number> dollars i could build a tabernacle that 'd make the wheeling <person> <person> look like a chicken-house ! 
we got jobs , man ; we 're working . why even take the chance ? 
spiritual advisor to the romanovs . in <number> , at a dinner in his honor , he was poisoned , shot , stabbed , clubbed , drowned and castrated . 
onscreen . 
what the hell does that mean ? come on , <person> , speak out straight once in your life . i know <person> ca n't , but you 're not sicilian , you can tell a woman the truth ; you can treat her like an equal , a fellow human being . 
oh ... uh , thanks a lot <person> ... i really appreciate it ... 
yeah , well , if the wife 's trying to sell it she 'll fuck up . she 's an amateur , just like <person> was . 
it 's a full moon , 'beware the moon ' . 
fine . you 're angry . do n't be . the important thing is we 're together now.. 
i know a guy in universal 's stock house -- he 's giving me the footage for free . this movie 's gon na look like a <number> bucks . 
what i know , <person> , is ... he 's going to take you out ... 
ricky , who knows how long we 're gon na have to be here . we got ta make it last . 
-- what advice ? you never -- 
get out , get out ! 
no -- 
we 're waiting , <person> . 
my brother <person> found him living in the streets when he was a kid , so my father took him in . he 's a good lawyer . 
she 's had a lot to deal with ... she needs time ... . 
well , in all likelihood , she 's completely guilty as well . she was seen standing over her husband 's dead body . 
right . give me your pen . we 'll tell 'em to bill <person> . 
naw , honey , that would be burglary . i never got arrested for burglary . <person> 's for chicken shits . if you 're gon na rob someone , ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it . just take the money . that 's robbery . that 's a whole 'nother deal . 
how about i pick <number> out for you ? 
okay , so you understand ? we 're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom , <number> in the kitchen , <number> in the living room , plus , of course , there 'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you . 
i 'm going to play my records all day 
i always get my man . 
he could be brought back . 
you were n't exactly horrified . 
it 's all right . i 'm fine . 
she back in kansas ? 
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices . you do n't have a choice . 
why did you help me ? 
oh , you mean the thrill ! 
we 're a long way from high school , <person> ... ... and i 'm scared . 
<person> la la la that ai n't no crime . that ai n't no crime . 
fuck him . he swings at anything in the dirt . i could strike him out . 
you bring me the heart of the jesuit general , and you will have a palace of your own . 
okay , whatta i do ? 
twist of lemon ! 
blow out the candles ! 
so when was he here ? 
well , i can . some injuries , spiritual or physical , can be excruciating to me . i 'm not a silly carhop any more . maybe you 're right about fish . when i was a carhop , i did n't feel much more than a fish would . but i 've been sensitized . i have ideas now -- and solid information . i know a lot more now -- and a lot of it has to do with you . 
well we have got about a <number> thousand pretty pieces of paper with the queen on it . will that do ? 
looks bad ? i 'm gon na tell you what looks bad . 
... years of thinking the matter over , i began to see that the whole thing was n't really my problem . 
all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes -- 
how 'd you find that out ? 
she shot you down . 
to get killed ... you 're not seriously going into an asteroid field ? 
best get down close to the moat , lad . 
do n't call him . 
we 'll burn this fuckin ' place down ! i got gasoline all over in here ! 
really ? is he cute ? 
yes ... 
tell him he can keep them . the bellboy looks puzzled . 
why ? 
i told you , he 's <number> of <person> <person> 's stock players ... 
nothing wrong with old age , frank ... long as you get there . 
this your place ? 
- but as i 've explained to sidney , without proof , there 's just no story . do n't you agree mr . <person> ? 
me and <person> <person> ? 
is n't it true that you -- 
because <person> knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here . 
what do you do far a living ? 
you can go with <person> . he 's taking <person> to school . but you 'll have to hurry . 
no prob : i 'll just hop down the hardware store -- 
smokey was on our tail . we had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu ... 
<person> beery . wrestling picture . what do you need , a road map ?

what do you think ? 
i said , the northwest valley .

i 'll be honest with you . 
shorty ! you 're alive ! ! but ... what about your head ? 
just a bad place . and the doorway to worse . 
come on , let 's get that mail . anything for <person> <person> ? 
oh god yes -- i 'm sorry . 
then who the hell have you been talking too ? 
well if i was looking for a victim , i definitely would n't pick your uncle phil who outweighs me by about <number> pounds , besides , who would i ask for ransom ? you ? ? 
oh , come on . 
what , you were going to come over the next day all calm and say , <person> that really made me mad ? do n't tell me you 're mad . be mad . be who you are right now . 
what do you want me to tell you , <person> , to go beat that girl up ? to go have sex with him ? i 'm not going to do that . yes , i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i 'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot . if that makes me too `` prissy '' for you , too bad . 
you know , i 've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean . 
well , sure . i 'll try to remember . <person> . 
i 'll have the blackbeard over easy . 
right , you got clicks , anything ? 
dude 's a half -- squid . ai n't many places he can hide . <person> <person> , maybe . 
i 'm talking about a girl you want to fuck , so give me a break . 
merrin ? i had notion he was over in iraq . i think i read he was working on a dig around nineveh . 
yeah , but that 's not the whole story . she got remarried . 
anything against zippers ? 
you may ask , lieutenant .

speck is dead . 
i did n't say that , j.j . 
gluck . 
yes . i mean that 's it . i wan na feel like a man with her . i wan na feel like the only man with her . 
would you buy me a cup of coffee ? in there ... 
get that idea out of your mind . it will only lead you in the wrong direction . 
that 's right -- we ca n't kill it on the ship , but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock . 
this is n't reality . this is fantasy . 
naomi . 
i was just thinking about my mom . she would n't leave him . i remember <number> time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . i mean it was dark outside and in . but we never talked about it . 
no beck 's . a-1 , <person> ... 
that would be appropriate , yes . 
sure , but is that it for the list ? 
... .buried in a shell-hole for thee days , while he 's out there playing polo and sticking pigs . 
it 's not picasso i 'm calling about . it 's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat . 
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ? 
if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor , he 'll come for me . so we 're going to set me up as bait to draw him out . give him a clean shot . that 's what you were thinking , is n't it ? 
jesus . about twelve more yards . keep coming just like that . 
i 'm in no rush . so what do you have in mind ? 
you remember an ex-cop named <person> <person> ? he works for a guy named <person> . 
heh heh . yeah . 
you told him . i 'm fucking hurting here . 
because i did only sleep with <number> guys ! that does n't mean i did n't just go with people . 
you must have had a fun child- 
it would n't be fair to the man in the street . there they are ... they are terrible things , those jewels ... . 
i can help them ! 
-- there 's no time -- 
uh ... yeah . yeah . she 's uh ... watchin ' over the little ones . 
what the hell does that mean ?

huh . you used to come to the club ? i should n't have let you in . you must have only been about sixteen . 
who did we lose ? 
we 'll leave first thing in the morning . 
so . 
< i > <person> said we should work together. < /i > 
read 'em ! 
do you think i should ? 
yes . we had a glorious night together . <number> day you 'll remember and write about it . 
quite right , invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women , chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar , disgusting ! 
i 'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place . get this door open ! 
yes way . it 's really ... 
oh , a new riot control grenade ... `` ... the successful combination of concussive , <number> foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of ... blah , blah , blah ... '' 
goodnight . 
you 're gon na shit your pants ! 
and what did you say ? 
he was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning . he said he had never seen any like them . 
join me once you have finished . i can wait for you in peking . 
shooting me wo n't get you anywhere . 
it 'll be a while before he 's up and running again . 
<number> ? 
i spoke to her . the guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him . 
<number> to <number> feet . 
well , i would n't want to trouble you with this now . 
i ca n't do that -- 
you think i 'm after money ? i told you , my friend . <person> . time for a change . <person> is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves . 
no . the other one . the one who disappeared up the block from christie . the one they made a beef on . 
so i did . i saw him lying buried in his shop . 
it 's ... slowing down , <person> . 
just some rich anglo out on the lake . do n't even live here all year . 
when 'd you decide to do it , <person> ? after which of his letters , huh ? the fortieth ? the fiftieth ? the first ? ! 
now , just have a little patience , my boy . your birthday is n't until next week . 
yor dad picking the music again ? 
you do n't like <person> <person> much do you ? 
no . 
he knows i 'm here . how ? 
no one knows . they say it blew up . 
maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart . 
same . none of the neighbors know . we told them you were in a hospital in europe . oh ... this is <person> <person> . he 's the american consul here ... and <person> <person> , the lawyer you wanted ... 
i did your dirty work for you <person> , now fuck off . theo drives away leaving <person> standing alone . she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression , then turns on her heel . 
jesus . 
what night is that ? 
thanks for the information . appreciate it . 
no , and yes . i do n't know what i 'm going to do about <person> . i know he is seeing someone else and that 's okay with me , and he thinks i 'm seeing someone else and that 's not okay with him . 
you got a very depressing view of life , man ... you got ta smile once in awhile ... 
momma , i 'm all right , i 'm fine , really i am . 
you would . 
that 's okay , that 's okay , that 's okay â€“ that 's just fine . you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap , thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium , maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn . you were dead wrong . we 're only interested in <number> thing : can you tell a story , <person> ? can you make us laugh , can you make us cry , can you make us wan na break out in joyous song ? is that more than <number> thing ? okay . the point is , i run this dump and i do n't know the technical mumbo-jumbo . why do i run it ? i 've got horse-sense , goddamnit . showmanship . and also , and i hope <person> told you this , i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town . did you tell him that , <person> ? and i do n't mean my dick 's bigger than yours , it 's not a sexual thing â€“ although , you 're the writer , you would know more about that . <person> ? 
i do n't know . 
... i ... ann ... .iinn.. ff ... .nnyin ... 
i thought you would have some ideas . 
and when she goes to those places ... 
forget it . 
the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything . 
come on . you 're seriously trying to tell me the japs ca n't find los angeles without my headlights ? 
i see . gold for ideas . you know <person> <person> , there 's something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd , guiding intelligence somewhere . whose idea was it ? how did it all start ? 
i was afraid you 'd say that . 
and after the steak ... do we send <person> to the movies and turn <person> 's picture to the wall ? 
everyone in the theater is screaming . <person> tries her best to detach herself from the movie . she eats her popcorn . 
el ? i 'm sorry . i do love you . and you are a lady . i have so much respect ... 
anything rated higher than a p.c . 's got a hard-wired suicide switch . it 'll self- destruct . 
you got ta be kiddin ' ... this is the boulevard ... you ca n't hear yourself think . 
i do n't know . i kind of am . 
you got to be crazy . 
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car ? it does n't make any goddamn sense . 
that-a-boy . hospital . 
<person> maitland , sweetie , you just listen now . this house is too big . it really ought to be for a couple with a family . 
yeah . 
i know you 're a good boy , <person> . no mother could ask for better . it 's just that ... 
baby , you 'll check them tomorrow . 
how much ? 
please , they 'll be here any minute . <person> put it in your bra . 
yeah , no , i see -- 
leave me alone ! you were willing to sacrifice a <number> <number> francs for her . well -- she 's worth it ! [ you were willing to pay a <number> and twenty-five thousand for a < u > handbag < /u > . you can pay a < u > hundred < /u > thousand for him ! ] 
no , but ... 
had in mind something a little more radical . 
dummy . 
no , the mediocre mantini . of course the great mantini ! 
i stopped that ! 
what do you drive ? 
then set out the good plates , we 'll all have lunch . my office will follow up with details . jumping off , now ... 
that old beast ? miss his breakfast ? not a chance . it 's always something , right ? 
the people at silver meadows are n't psychos . 
at the ranch maybe ? 
i got ways , <person> , i got ways . <person> , okay ... i got a deal with some a the paramedics . my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue . so whaddya think ? this clip 's got ta be worth at least a grand . <person> ? 
what the fuck possessed you ? 
what responsibility ? you 're closing the fucking store to play hockey . 
oh ! <person> , <person> -- was it -- i thought she said , <person> -- 
why has n't he gone into his wife 's bedroom all day ? 
i have faith . in horoscopes and fortune cookies ... 
specialty product . 
then let 's act like friends . let 's talk . i know this is a new place , and -- 
the first rule of project -- 
it was insane here , man . <number> call in the national guard . then i did my laundry ... watched <number> . 
we 're partners , are n't we ? 
yeah , i felt that way , too , when i first started , but now ... the hours , the repetition ... it 's not all glamour and mall openings anymore . maybe i should 've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier , i do n't know ... ... i just hope it 's not too late for me . god ! <person> to me , `` me , me , me . '' it 's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself . <person> , right ? that 's it , no more about me tonight , i promise ... let 's talk about you ... what do you think about me ? i 'm kidding ... seriously , <person> , i 'm doing all the talking here ... 
<person> oberfeld in person . did you kill him ? 
kelly , get to work on those new uniforms . i 'm not running a summer camp here.. 
i think it was ... i 'm sure it was 2nd street . 
nyah , it 's very important not do anything to alarm ambrose.. 
maybe they 'll be < u > other < /u > movies . 
the attacks are unceasing : by night , the dark ones ; by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers . 
then tell me this is n't true ! that your concern for your play and career is <number> thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career ! 
announcing what ? 
-- shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak ! 
i had n't thought about it . 
i 'm not leaving without those stones . 
the key to success is using the right tools . 
i been thinkin ' about us , too -- about our people livin ' like pigs , an ' good rich lan ' layin ' fallow , or maybe <number> fella with a <number> acres , while a hundred thousan ' farmers is starvin ' . an ' i been wonderin ' if all our folks got together an ' yelled -- 
to anybody . 
<number> . since i 've been here . 
listen to her ! `` that 's what he 's here for '' ! he 's here to loose , that 's what he 's here for . first of all , i 'm unbeatable . second , how old are you ? 
he 's weird . and i expect more from you . 
<person> and i could never be made , because we bad irish blood . it did n't even matter that my mother was sicilian . to become a member of a crew , you 've got to be <number> <number> percent <person> <person> that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country . 
i was going to my cave to find my power animal . 
i think it 's cute - look at his little weasel teeth . 
you did n't have a choice ? where 's kat and what have you done with her ? 
yeah . 
if anyone 's going , i could use some coffee . 
my laboratory was about ... here . and the kitchen was over there , where that tree is . mrs. watchit would n't allow me in much ... but , yes , this is about the kitchen . 
colonel , remember , a reprimand from the president can be pretty serious to a career officer ... just a second , operator , i know i have it somewhere . 
oooooo . that hurt . 
who gives a damn ? 
<person> , he 's a crazy man . 
i hear she 's getting real fat . 
of course not ! you are english pigs . 
oh , well , i knew that before you- even left . i told you , 'kenny , that old nash wo n't make it down the road . ' but you had to go . 
there are procedures , <person> , that i want followed . my procedures . and considering what 's going on , i want you to follow them very closely . 
not because you have to . 
if <person> 's a psycho , <person> will still be ok , wo n't he ? 
<person> 's a little scared of death . and the main reason <person> 's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death . now you just go ahead and tell me i 'm wrong . 
eddie , i received a letter from the government . they 're cutting off my unemployment . that 's all i 've got . without it , i ca n't pay the rent ... 
hello , <person> . 
it was n't supposed to happen like this . 
i 'm not saying that . 
hmm-mmmm .

because it 's fair . give me next quarter . if you still feel this way , vote your shares ... 
ai n't it . 
c'mon , jake . you know she 's crazy about you . 
everything . i 'm a goddamn human-pinata ... 
i said i do n't have any . 
i ca n't do it . 
of course you will . 
may i add , sir , that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of <person> <person> 's capital on your night table . that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust , sir . i view with alarm , sir , the influence over you of this bolshevik lady . 
i do n't know who i am . 
i 've called the hospital ; they 've notified consiglere genco 's family to come and wait . he wo n't last out the night . 
the presidency wo n't protect us , <person> . we 're beyond politics now ... 
it can wait . 
cast iron ? 
i do n't want him hurt ... 
all right , <person> . i do n't wan na talk anymore about it . i do n't think i got <number> hour 's sleep the whole night . last night was the first time in my life i ever heard my mother cry , you know that ? 
sure is ! come on in , and sing a spell . 
um ... it 's ... 
no , you 're not . where are you ? where are you ? 
i take it your -- your parents could n't -- uh -- 
that would be an excellent start . tell him to keep a low profile . 
well -- that 's how it is for programs , yes , but -- 
it 's in a green <person> ? 
my name is <person> <person> . 
yeah . i was trying to get in touch with you . we got dissconnected . 
like what , <person> <person> ? 
the same thing that always happens ! you blew it ! and this time you broke your son 's heart instead of mine ! he was so proud , looking forward to going to a movie with his father ... and you let him down ! like you let everybody down , always ! what did you do , take a mudbath ? 
aye , sir -- 
i do seem to be ... maybe because i 'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow . 
is he married ? 
how can you think about food at a time like this ? 
i did n't just fuck myself ! <person> , i 'm going to be sick ! 
no , mr . powers , i expect them to die . even after they pay me the money , i 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma . all right , guard , begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism . 
whyâ€”uhâ€”she 's all right , sir . 
nothing . that 's all i can say . 
he was like sucking my tits . he was fucking fingering me . but that shit was nice and hard . 
why did n't you tell me ? 
but suppose he loses ? 
what you need is a collar . 
they twisted my arm . 
then find them . 
yeah , yeah . i want you right next to me , no matter where i go , you understand ? 
and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ? 
i slept very well . 
businessman ! 
no stop where he 's all besieged . 
sue ... < i > look at your hands < /i > . 
that 's what i 'm running away from . i worked with <number> different ones in the last <number> years . oh , brother ! 
i do n't know anymore . 
but 
and we 'll sell the house . 
hold still , <person> ! 
no i 'm not ... 
is that a fact ? well , that fits in right along with everything i 've been saying . war is not all black . 
my mate has been acting very strange . i ca n't explain it ... ..but . i have n't been feeling very well myself . i do n't know , maybe it 's me . i needed an sp9 last night . i feel as if something odd were happening to me . something ... . 
this paint sucks . the white shows through . 
but the key to islam is submission . that is why twice daily we turn to mecca , to the holy of holies , to pray . we bend our knees in submission . 
you think it will ? 
mami , the first time i brought him home , those were your exact words -- `` some chulo with grease under his nails . '' 
i -- i 'm wearin ' this costume . i 'm , uh , i 'm gon na do my talent tonight . 
i 'm not ready to be a pop-pop . 
meaning that he was n't murdered first , say on the deck of the boat , and then thrown overboard . 
in langley . 
funny shit , man . 
help me put him back in his chair . 
now , i saw some rough stuff on your priors , but nothing in the nature of a homicide ... 
and he has finer moments now and then . 
on the left . 
i 'm fine . 
no , not yet . 
you 're not far wrong . 
yes , you made your feeling abun- dantly clear . now they want to do the same with theirs . 
not <number> of <person> 's finer moments . 
you 're lying . 
okay , seriously , both you listen ta me now . 
any bodyguards ? 
yeah , that 's right ! i 'm outta here -- y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye ! ... i 'm gone with the wind . 
now is n't that just too cute ? there 's a brain behind that face of yours , is n't there ? you 've got everything nicely figured out , for yourself , including this . 
why not ? 
i thought <person> 's ankle was okay for next game . 
you never heard of that ? 
take us to vegas . 
that 's really thoughtful but i -- 
but what did you get on your sats ? 
this would be an enormous favor to me . i am a man of means , <person> <person> . when this nonsense is over i will be most grateful . 
um-hmm . <person> too perfect . 
that 's alright . i 'd rather not know your real names anyways . i 'm <person> . <person> , i 'm gon na get right to the point . i 'll pay you ten grand plus expenses , all payable after you do her ... 
337-09-9876 . but i do n't want anyone to know my name . 
not me ... all my other my patients . i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here . 
and i -- we -- want some black people up . 
i guess he 's outside someplace i do n't like takin ' him down to certain places . 
mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all ... 
it 's time to go home , <person> . 
it was n't like that . 
do n't . i do n't want it . 
yeah . in the late innings . ya look like a night 's sleep would n't kill ya . 
sir , i have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom -- 
what do you want me to say ? yes , i suppose some of the things you 're saying may be true . but that 's the way things are ; it 's not going to change . 
price of doing business ... 
have you ever seen a dead body before , ms. scott ? 
what ? 
cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap . 
do you want the car ? 
um ... yeah but it 's more ... 
you ca n't really believe that . 
<person> ' numbers without i know about it is both illegal and unhealthy . you remember that . 
leave the boy . take me . 
in <number> years the grass has invaded everything . there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor . i hardly ever go out . 
i 've been hoping to run into you . 
yeah . 
now , <person> , you 're exaggerating . 
do n't say nothin ' about that boy . 
she took off in the night ! 
hey , he 's not a waiter ... 
great saints ! 
well you know <person> 's history . you 're the one who got him out of the soviet union was it still in bio- weapon business . 
pest control . 
you can cut out the sir , lance -- i 'm <person> kilgore -- i 'm a goofy foot . 
not what i meant ; why < u > me < /u > ? 
i do n't know , yet . what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale , not decreasing . whatever it is , he is n't finished ... 
i did n't do anything . 
it 's all right -- if you like honest faces -- let 's have another drink -- <person> ! 
where do you think you 're taking this , huh ? gon na be a big hero , avenge that little girl 's death ? gon na make everything right with the world ? how you gon na do that ... ? 
believe me . it 's me . it 's really me . 
he was n't touching me he was just ... gesturing ... 
well , then ask her , dumb ass . 
that 's right , your life is <person> , and i 'm to blame . it 's that simple . 
i ... 
i told halloran we did n't do vocals , but he said : 
there is <number> other thing . i 'd buy yourself a gun if i were you . if you start becoming sensitive to the daylight , if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you 've had to drink -- then i suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself . better that , than the alternative . 
y'know what i mean . got a gig yet for <person> and i yet ? 
they shot him at a downward angle . they put him on his knees . 
yeah . 
ahh , i hate this town ! places like this just make you small ... i should have never come back here after college . 
okay . how ? 
and she got the medium . 
uh huh ... 
yes , please . you said he gave a name ... 
no . i married a midget . 
i 'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book . i 'd be announcing myself as the killer . i 'm not stupid . 
why do n't i take him over to the office and verify it , huh ? 
or somebody wanting me to believe that . 
i just saw it in the mirror , it does n't look like my ass anymore . 
i do n't let myself think about it , even- - but i do know the part so well , and every bit of the staging , there 'd be no need to break in a new girl- - but suppose i had to go on <number> night ? to an audience that came to see <person> <person> . no , i could n't possibly ... 
he 's misunderstood . 
... <number> . 
just some local <person> , you know , then a little burgundy . that old <person> de <person> ! 
i just struck it rich ... i think we can do a little business . as a matter of fact , i think we can have a party . 
we had him . 
can she be forced ? 
how 's it going ? 
no . they just try to hold you for ransom . fuck you , moses ! i 'm outa here ! 
well , i 'm going to read it anyway . 
that 's mighty black of you . 
... and an attractive financial prospect for <person> . 
okay . i 'm sorry about that . 
yeah , you know . probably dresses in men 's clothing , swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole , and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named <person> or smoocher or ... 
[ follow me . ] 
sheila ! 
hello . 
can i come in for a minute ? 
of course , sir . 
oh , i do n't mind .

but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else , i see more deeply into it ... 
i 'll give you seventy-five bucks for it . 
twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch . 
i 'm a historian , <person> <person> . only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face . 
sure - my pal on the paper . she 's subbing for the society editor tonight . 
why not ? he eats everything else . 
i do n't know - maybe they are talking about it now . mr vitovetch is a good friend of the judge . 
then why do n't you want to teach it to me too ? now that there 's no more cranking , and it 's easier ? 
<number> <number> francs . if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people <number> cows . who am i to cost the russian people <number> cows ?

she 's a broad ! got it ! just some broad ! 
i do n't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life ; it 's not a happy story ... 
chief <person> is the one who got you out . 
the duke ? 
or maybe it 's <person> who 's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she ca n't stop ? 
gee , you 're home early ! 
huh ?

but it 's not totally hopeless for you ... i 've had it . i do n't even have the energy to try anymore . you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you do n't end up like me ... 
if the key 's on him , how do we get the key ? 
yep . and guess who they hired to seal up the place ? 
yes , <person> ? 
then you have no use for the sword . 
there 's no one else here .

the way you describe him does n't really do him justice . 
of *course* there 's worms , <person> ! and what is them worms , really ? they just *protein* , them worms ! they is *good* for you ! 
good morningâ€” 
but what if ... ? 
oh <person> , you 're so funny . now i have something that 's kind of delicate ... 
the way i figure it , it was them or me . i thought putting <person> up on that pipe was a nice touch ? bought a little time . made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around . but it 's just us on this ship . <person> and your ... spirit friends . 
there 's not much to tell . 
i mean , could you put me up for a couple of weeks ? 
yeah ! 
your <person> told you a nakedfaced lie . 
it 's true . that 's ... you have to believe me ! oh god , i 'm telling you the truth ! i did what i had to , <person> . she was gone . there was nothing i could do for her . i did ... i put her in the lake . i rolled the car in ... and i watched it sink . and i 've lived with that image ever since . i could n't just stand there while everything -- my career , us , everything , just washed away . do n't you see , claire ? she 's doing this ! this is exactly what she wants you to think ! 
<person> mrs. sennett . 
do n't panic , <person> . 
and the child is n't coming ? 
well ... thanks , anyway . 
suck my cock ! 
yeah , man , my manager and my lawyer . 
right . you 're right . 
the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view . 
that food has spoiled . that is why it was not shipped to the army . 
she 's < u > not < /u > `` missing . '' did she shout ? did she scream ? did he coerce her ? < u > no < /u > . she left of her own free will .. and if she gets on a plane and goes to peru with the prick , she 's still not missing . you got no case , <person> . 
if it was some poor mojado , swam across at night , got lost in the scrub and starved out there , we would n't go any further . but this is a formerly prominent citizen . 
well , i do n't know what you want me to do , virginia . if you want me , i 'll go talk to her tonight . 
you see this line here ? it 's your life line . here 's where you were born . and this is where you got married . you 're a married man , huh ? oh oh . <person> . <person> . see this split . 
you want me to ride down with you ? 
yes .

there ya go . 
keep me informed of what he 's up to . you help me , i 'll help you . 
oh yeah ? seems to me , reverend , you ' more concerned 'bout your good . guess it looks kind 'a bad , havin ' me for a son-in-law . 
bread ? no , no , no . <person> ... . gravy ... very small rocks ... 
no . it 's going to be about a half-hour . 
you did n't know that at the time ! 
he went down to the lobby for a minute . he should be right back . would you like come in ? 
we did n't want to get mixed up with lawyers . they are very expensive here . if you just say hello to a lawyer ... well , there goes another cow . 
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate ... 
killing wildlife not good enough anymore , so you go on to bigger and better things . 
<person> ! 
i know how you feel , humiliated in the hands of a woman . i 'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate ... 
she left me . she 's gone again . 
do you know who was brought in for questioning ? 
me . hit me ! 
rules are made to be broken . 
i could n't believe it . i was thinking of you by then , a lot , wondering what it would be like if we did meet . like if we could take a time-out ... 
you may be right . 
she 's not at home ? 
you do n't like my costume ? cool . i 'll go with plan b . <person> <number> you like better ? 
do you know me ? 
champagne on the rocks . oh-could i have that with a twist ? she starts to sink back in her chair and <person> leans over and pulls her back up . 
i just thought ... sure . <person> <person> <person> . 
i live there . <person> . 
i do n't follow you . 
and above all , just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever ... 
only you ... 
-- okay ... hang on , i got ta move -- 
remain calm . 
let 's get some power here . 
i need to talk to <person> . 
i do . 
you want my advice ? 
ca n't you get to sleep ? 
honey , i got ta start makin ' money . 
rioting both sides of the bay , in chestertown they burned the customs house and tar-and-feathered the customs agent . he died of burns . in wilmington they killed a royal magistrate and <number> redcoats . 
good question . 
i make my end of the cash at <number> . now i 'm trying to figure out the bonds . what the face value is . 
<person> , that 's the largest city . 
<number> <number> dollars ? come on , <person> . 
why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand ? 
whoa ! ... the government . they control everybody 's mind . you 're too fucking stupid to know that ? 
it has n't been laid out , we have n't finished with the embalming . as a matter of fact , you 're looking at it . the remains of <person> <person> . sitting up . it is my last wish to be buried sitting up . 
you -- you think i 'm right ? 
let 's see it . 
of what ? 
-- <number> -- 
oh , yes ! where 's mine ? i want to look like you . 
what ? 
no , but they took my blender . 
are you lying to me ? 
they mean , <person> ! , that the black panther party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons . we are going to shoot you ! ! ! 
<person> ? to celebrate <person> 's birthday with some heroic piece by <person> but without the nazi salute ? <person> . 
then what 's the story , what 's this `` strange '' bullshit all of a sudden ? is he drowning puppies , or what ? 
good ! it 'll save me the trouble of repeating myself . he 's not fucking driving you ! 
i was talking about <person> . 
fine - keep on yelling - do everything you can to disturb <person> - now what about your cousin ? 
<person> to enterprise . <person> to enterprise -- do you read me ? 
i 'm sure of it . just as i 'm sure there 's a wish for shangri-la in everyone 's heart . i have never seen the outside world . but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy . yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security , where there 's beauty and comfort , where they would n't have to be mean and greedy . oh , i just wish the whole world might come to this valley . 
well , i thought that ... well , the way it always works is that sga president does a count , then the sga advisor , you know , for the <number> independent counts . 
i 'm a proper citizen , i 'm a decent man , i do n't do anything that is n't decent or proper . i know i should n't tell you this ... 
hey , <person> ! <person> ! 
why not ? 
the mainland ... is dead ... a dead place ... nobody there ... 
... it looked money . 
c'mon , cut it out . 
ca n't you make it later ? 
best part of the job . 
but how ? 
nobody wants to be a sidekick , <person> . so <number> day he comes to us - he 's got a proposition . we help him get your body ... in return he gives us all the nightmares we want . 
do n't worry . he found the chocolate room . 
i could n't go to sleep , <person> . i had to tell you ! 
get the fuck away from me . 
the brakes are shot . 
maybe ... maybe ... maybe . 
oh 
it was just a year , give or take a few days . i mean , it 's not like we did n't get along or anything . we had fun , we just did n't have that ... that thing , you know ? that spark , you know what i mean ? you got ta have that . 
it 's always hard to see the young ones called home , especially on an exploding thresher . it 's just so odd and gross . 
shut the hell up . 
bain ! 
the power of creation -- 
with <person> ? 
jeff , do you think a murderer would let you see all that ? that he should n't keep his shades down and hide behind them ? 
'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light , you know . sure is a peculiar thing . 
no way . 
everything still checks out okay . 
no ... no , i 'm tired of talking , i 've been talking for weeks , nobody believes me when i tell them anything ... nobody listens to me . 
where -- ? 
that bugger moves fast . 
you do n't just sign up to be a police officer -- it 's about <number> years of training -- ok ? 
satisfied with your cabin ? 
some mexican ? how much could he weigh ? a buck fifty , tops ? i 'd kick his fucking ass . 
no , they sold the house in <number> to a millionaire , <person> <person> . 
you ca n't do this - 
right o ' . 
well , we all have a degree of narcissism , <person> , but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed . 
you got that right . i thought you wanted to kill vampires . 
is that <person> ? 
he works on the movie . 
i got ta take some money out , that 's what for . 
i know . scribbage ! 
i do n't care what she wears . 
just people . they got ta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money . this is why the big lobby , <person> . but they put their pants on <number> leg at a time . just like you and me . 
oral hygiene ? 
yeah -- being a basket case . 
i was there . an eyewitness . 
everyone has a job - a function . each <number> teaches you more about your invention . i 'm what is called a < u > murderer < /u > . 
i have dispatches a message to fromberge requesting that <person> be kept far from the fighting . 
well , i could say the same about you . 
it gave me a little chance , and i took it . they wo n't get me back . i 'm going to live , and you 're going to help me . yes ? 
what if we just do n't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story ? 
shhhh . 
bird books mostly ... 
switek ? 
oh , so i 'm disposable ? 
nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . <person> told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her . 
why do n't you tell me something for a change ? 
if this war ended tomorrow , <person> is where the party would be . 
hi . 
do n't tell me they 're refueling ... 
i have no intention whatsoever of hinting . your sister , <person> , is a murderess . she killed <person> <person> -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding . 
did you do it ? 
hey , <person> -- do n't go away mad . 
we 're ticketed to fly back from baltimore , anyway . 
fuck you ! you know what he did to me ? ! ... 
i do n't know . 
certainly , my son , certainly . is there something troubling you , my son ? do n't be shy to speak up . remember , i know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women . 
try not to sweat ? 
why do they call you <person> ? 
lakeview the deli ? oh , shit ! 
what ? 
no . i mean it , thank you . 
he was just having fun . 
yeah , and hurry up . 
he 's at home . <person> , i ca n't believe he went to the store . i 'm mortified , actually . i 'm really sorry . he had no right to do that , and i told him so . 
pay attention . the 600 series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . <person> , bad breath , everything . very hard to spot . i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him . 
i 'm afraid . 
yes ... i suppose it is . keep it . 
they kept this scrapbook of your life . it meant the world to them . 
you see , he 's giving it to us anyway . 
nothing ! i simply existed . so what was the answer ? a jealous woman , right ? a clinging possessive mother . <person> . with all due respect to oedipus , i do n't think that was the case at all . 
it could happen . what about his state certification exams ? the records seem to be in order . 
good , 'cause i liked what i saw . 
ah . couple days ago . 
can hardly wait to do it again . 
<person> sie dead ! raus mit dem <person> . <person> ! los ! 
i would n't think of it . see you around , fellas . 
i do n't wan na go . 
this vehicle 's not safe to drive . we 're gon na have to impound it . get you towed . step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk . i 'm sorry , sir , you 'll have to find another cab . 
which is it ? 
this is n't funny ! i happen to have a very important date in like <number> minutes ! 
no , i did n't . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy . 
i was . 
correct . 
thanks , do n't mind if i do . 
preysing , you 're joking with us . 
let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone . 
i 'm here . 
well , sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power . but , we ruled that out , as they invariably are provided with too much documentation , too much american identity ... we , uh ... do n't quite know what to make of it yet , sir ... but we 'll keep on top of it , <person> <person> - we 'll come up with the answer . 
no , thanks ... 
i hope so . <person> , <person> <person> , about your wife : if i had known she was married -- 
that 's a real < u > fault < /u > , i ... 
would you know this store again ? 
heard grandpa <person> and grandmama talkin ' . 
fine . 
i did n't know it was classified information . i mean , i know we do n't have any customers , but i thought that was a bad thing , not , like , a business strategy . 
oh yeah ... i 'm gon na save you . 
go ! 
try to keep it to a minimum . 
<person> ... 
the delivery boy . 
besides , if i lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property -- which i do not -- i would n't need a partner , much less a callow girl . i 'd do it myself . 
no . 
so where have you been staying ? 
enough though , eh ? 
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing . 
i want you to hear this , pal ... forget the overages , < u > forget < /u > ten thousand dollars for <number> days to <number> weeks . you know what it would cost for them to < u > build < /u > this set ? <number> <person> <person> ! now : 
there 's the car ! there 's the car ! 
do n't get mad . 
we do n't have to do it that way . we can catch him this time . 
that is sedition ! <person> ! 
bullshit . 
that 's what we 're here for . come on , frank . 
i 'll see . 
i got an eighteen minute window . eighteen minutes , and your company catches up on ten years of research . 
well it certainly looks bigger that it seems . 
no boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat ! 
mind your own business , <person> . 
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf ? 
it would n't hurt to hear the plan , i guess . 
yes..thank god.. 
well , forget about it . <person> and i are going to rio . we 're hurt , we 're tired , and a hero ai n't nothing but a sandwich . <person> , buddy ? ... 
no . it 's the little boy that lives in my mouth . 
maybe it 's an italian thing . their mother was italian . 
no i ai n't . 
and still it fits ? 
you might find a bullet through that head ... 
<person> was running out the door ? ohhhhhh ... see that 's where i was confused , because i thought you said <person> was running out the door . 
uh , uh . you lie down and you 'll go to sleep 
you 're all hear . 
yes . i am a bit tired , after all . 
take ten . 
i sure would . 
only if we both get outta this alive . and there may be a way . 
from what i 've seen , <person> <person> , you have a very good case ... 
what are you snickering about ? 
you 're a peculiar chap . 
i am . i was just ... i just got ... i think i got nervous . it 's normal , right ? do n't you ever feel nervous about , you know ? 
okay , but just tell him this is <number> favor i ca n't give . but he should try me again on anything else . 
yeah . it 's wedged in between wyoming and nevada . i 'm sure you 've seen pictures . 
i 'll be out in a minute . 
i 'm willing to take that risk . 
thank you . 
pretty stiff . 
noâ€”no . what the deuce do i want toâ€” 
pity you do n't have the character . 
i do n't know , sir . 
i went myself to oversee the operation . did n't help much . 
and the last thing she 'd leave behind would be her wedding ring ! do you ever leave yours at home ? 
i 've been great . and you ? 
it 's not just the cable system . it 's in the phone system as well , the electronic net . it 's everywhere . 
you mean it 's heisted . 
with every breath we shall hunt them down . 
i 'm sorry . 
<person> . come on . the question . the question you 've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning . the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself -- 
the police department at merritsville . they called to report . the trunk was just picked up -- by mrs. <person> <person> . 
i think i should . <number> ? 
i heard a scream . when i got there i found him on the floor . he was having some kind of seizure . i did n't see anybody else . 
the 'question ' -- 
i imagine it would , yes . so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties . 
i did n't say i did n't . you assumed i did n't . 
wait . 
you know , i came back to <person> <person> to retire . i do n't need to be in government . 
uh-huh . another news clipping . another <number> about <person> 's mom . <person> , whether we like it or not it looks like we 're going to have to go back into our past . 
no ! spies or something . and <person> from work ... get down ! 
for climbing . 
me ? i 've never been better . i mean having my wife walk out on me after <number> years of marriage agrees with me just fine . 
where is he ? 
i 'm not kidding . 
well once . mary . 
that 's good . that 's very good . now <person> , you go out and gas up the ford , check the oil and tires , we do n't want any problems on the road . <number> more thing ... if anybody but you comes back ... 
<person> <person> 's . and that 's the only thing saving your sorry ass . 
what will i tell the others ? they care about you . 
conference rooms , though some have other functions . the <number> up front doubles as an emergency medical center . 
well , this <number> 's yours now . you ready to take care of it ? 
-- go , go , go . i 'm givin ' pearls here . and i'ii tell you samethin ' else : i 'm not succeding in the bush because i 'm <person> <person> <person> . if anything , there are women out there that want to < u > destroy < /u > me -- it makes it twice as hard for me , i run into some little muffin , knows who i am , knows my schemes and plans -- shit , she 's gon na wan na fuck around , prove to her friends , say , `` yaddda-yadda-yadda , i saw that guy , he was n't anything , did n't get me . '' so me ? i 'm runnin ' on full throttle the whole fuckin ' time . dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties . but i'ii tell you this : the battle of the bush is being fought and won by <person> <person> . can i have a cigarette ? 
who knows ? if dr . darling is right , you should watch out . 
i ca n't be . 
no , i 'll wash them . i 'll take them home and bring them back . 
is the hill ours too ? 
no . no , that 's okay . 
i do n't know , dude . 
well -- sure , i could do that -- 
what the fuck happened to you ? will you tell me ? 
where did this come from ? 
like who you really are and what you 're doing here and what this thing is . 
yes and if you cut him down , we will give you ten percent . 
ok . 
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him ? 
you 're right . 
i know . 
i do n't know if obsessions have reasons . i think that 's why they 're obsessions . 
michael , you should n't be happy when someone else is n't feeling well . 
you 're serious ! 
it ca n't fly in this weather . 
... try this <number> out some- ... 
shut up ! 
a-duh ... you 're a werewolf . and we , as your victims , have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted . 
i was . an experiment . just to see if i could do it . 
<person> ... 
thank you . thank you very much . 
what do you want here ? 
yes , i 'm right ? 
thinking about what ? 
this is the story . 
remember -- open mind . 
havana ? cubans do n't like us or my business ... 
that 's when you went in the sphere . 
we need blood . to nourish the stone . charge the stone with ener- gy . 
he 's blanked out on that <number> particular point . 
i 'm gon na go now . 
i guess you could say we 're entopologists of a sort . 

i promise i 'll come back . i promise i 'll never leave you . and there 's plenty of water and food . you can have a party . 
a gay senator 's son who let his <person> get fragged on a training exercise ? the press 'll crucify you and your father . his career will be over and it 'll be your fault . but we do this different and you come out a hero . 
what do you need me for ? 
i 'm sure . it 's her husband . he 's her campaign manager . 
i 've got balls like watermelons , i 'm telling you . 
no , she 's talking about your hair . 
yeah , and you keep not answerin ' , too . 
it 's been a long time , ma . 
there was no other way . 
wait , i 'll get you some air . 
you tight with <person> <person> <person> ? 
fine . and i want you to know i 'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- sheldrake sure you will . say , <person> , about the apartment - now that you got a raise , do n't you think we can afford a second key ? 
you just stay put . you need rest . 
it â€™ s barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall . 
i told <person> . 
the water tastes better in the kitchen . 
i hate this fucking place . 
i do n't have to . 
that 's good ... that 's good . 
damn you , <person> ! you 've already got everybody half-hysterical around here . 
esthetics are subjective , are n't they , <person> <person> ? i 'm <person> <person> . if you ever need me . 
i know . i wish i felt the same . unfortunately , i feel nothing . i think it was just the conquest . <person> , i 'm completely fucked up . 
i called my wife ! 
i do n't think so ... 
we should check the records , and , we should talk to lynn . 
oh , you mean the suit . <person> kept all my old clothes . <person> okay , but it 's a little big . 
yup . 
what ? 
turn over . 
now you 're irritating and absurd ! 
well , that 's you all over . 
never show mercy ! 
you never did know when to quit . 
i 'm staying here . 
i 'm honored , <person> <person> ... but no more tricks . 
well , i feel kind of like an animal living out here . i mean , there 's no place to bathe and ... no place to get anything good to eat . 
forget it . i'11 probably shit blood tonight . 
you know , my dad 's done some work for <person> ... 
just <number> favor . 
what 's that ? 
you could n't do that , <person> . 
i 'm your daughter all the time , you know . not just when it 's convenient . 
just us . 
wow ! 
i ca n't work this . 
no , i do n't think you 're like , `` i 'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do n't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you '' . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery . 
look , you ca n't buy what i know . ya ca n't . i 've seen it all ! i got pain an ' i got experience . 
when ? 
that 's what he was saying about you . 
it 's poison gas , this is the antidote . drink it . 
that 's right and now that you 're no longer a virgin . you got ta die -- those are the rules . 
i 've always wanted to make love to an angry welder . i 've dreamed of nothing else since i was a small boy . 
... damn you ! damn you ! 
no . 
bullshit . 
in that case , we 'll need to make it a school-wide blow out . 
<person> ? his name is a past tense ? 
aw julie , it 's my job . it 's like being a doctor . 
thanks 
but i 'm not . i 'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could n't possibly understand . 
would you care for a drink while you 're waiting ? i can put it on the underhill bill . 
lay it on me . 
we did n't have sex . 
you redneck idiot , do you have ... 
i did n't mean you . listen , maybe ... 
i have an idea . but , i mean , i 'm just making this up ... 
my wife publicly defied the law . they 've arrested her and <number> others . 
i remember how there was <number> of them deputies you shot ... not <number> . 
ss'kya'ta ' . 
<number> , sir , and make them short ones , do you hear , <person> <person> ? 
what old mill ? is that somewhere we -- 
no , you got quite a mess here , i 'll admit that . maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney seems a little pointless , though . <person> accident like this would n't happen again in a <number> years . you want some help cleaning up ? 
have they said anything about our area ? 
like i give a fuck . 
tell him next time he pulls any shit , you 're gon na kick his fat ass . 
not without <person> . 
... gim me some help ... 
i do n't think she 'll need you very much -- i aim to do most of the protecting myself . 
that 's the way he is . 
he did n't . 
mostly , we open a can of beans and boil some coffee . 
i was afraid of that . 
because she 's the type . 
this an accident , <person> ? 
i do n't think so . just reach on in . 
yeah , but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man . 
they are . when she calls me now , she 's a different person-she 's frightened and vulnerable . she 's about to finish college and enter the real world . that 's got to be scary for anyone . 
kelly , i want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows . 
watch me . 
you see , i 've got the best house in all of addley . it 's not the biggest house , but it 's got the best location , right next to the junior high baseball field . the garage windows face left field . the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them . the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens . <number> <number> yards from home plate to my garage windows . it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far . i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up , the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship . i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass , i know we 're <number> step closer to winning it all . 
we 'll think of something . 
he requested this ? 
he 's doped to the < u > <person> < /u > ... 
nope . there was some talk ; it never panned . 
norman ... 
no , no , no , no , no . we got ta go to mcgruder ! i go where the truck goes ! 
thank you , nurse . <person> , she 's ready ! <person> and load ! 
he stole a tractor . 
he says you are very sad ridiculous man . i do n't agree of course . and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute . <person> is a prostitute . i 'm sorry . 
you wo n't have to . 
we 'd love to hear it . 
it 's your move , <person> . 
how much did you get for them ? how much did you get for them ? 
i do n't know -- he does n't exactly confide in me . 
i was gone , in september , laying traplines . she went to our cache for some meat . <person> mauled by a bear . tore open her skull . -more- 
as you were , <person> <person> . 
you thought i was some fucking jerk ? 
how about the doorway ? 
wo n't you be late for work ? 
no ! you ca n't have me . kill me . 
on screen . 
a photograph ? what 's the matter ? has n't mama had you done in oils yet ? `` just a gigolo . . . `` 
oh , oh , oh -- i thought it was your apartment . you seemed at home here . 
we can fight . that 's what we 're here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the shi'ites , and the khurds . 
stop her ! 
yup . 
then what ? exactly . 
i do n't know , ma'am . he was observed earlier , i believe . 
chris -- <person> -- ! 
oh , look . i 'm the umpire , and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast <number> and i call it a ball . what would you do ? 
do you want to stop ? 
you have to say that . 
as far as the greens maybe . i do n't know if my putting would come back or not , without some practice . 
it may not be your decision to make . 
ever seen an uncut diamond , <person> ? they look like plain old rocks . 
thanks . you think this whole business is silly , do n't you ? i mean running away and everything . 
i love you too . 
do n't you feel anything for me at all any more ? 
is that mandrake , <person> <person> ? 
the majority . the majority . yes . let 's hear from the majority . 
like hell ! 
yeah , but what if some nut pulled gun on you ? 
they 're ... around . 
fine . 
i do n't know . 
yeah . 
too bad your precious <person> ca n't hear you ... the damsel in distress ... a rescue attempt would be most amusing ... we could flay sweet jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment ... 
about twenty-five years ago . they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell . 
the great war ? 
why do n't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline . 
it 's <person> . <person> 's got her . 
so do i ! 
she did n't know he was a criminal . they had a relationship . they -- 
sure . 
you 'll be smiling once you 've got all that money to spend , cousin . <person> <person> 's going to make everybody rich ! 
you know general mclelland , he would n't attack unless he had everything just right . finally <person> <person> came to him and said , general , if you 're not going to use my army , could i borrow it for a while ? so he gave it to grant and <person> just said , let 's go . 
pretty clever : if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time , <person> 's is the first place they 'll look . they may figure you 're waiting for an airplane , so you ca n't stay in the shack by the airstrip . last place they 'd expect you is on the far side of town . i ca n't afford any trouble -- 
fuck that redneck noise , dude . all dem chicks be rappin ' how dey losin ' der ' ho 's and how dey ai n't got no bread for beer . <person> dat honky shit . <person> to get me some motown jams , dig it ? 
how will he do that ? 
well of course i can swim , if the occasion calls for it . 
see that table over there ? i 'd like to pay their bill . 
... you mentioned the `` bay of pigs '' several times . <person> or later they 're going to want to know what that means . they 're going to want to know what was on that gap ... 
so i guess a blowjob 's out of the question ? 
<person> , <person> ... i 'm a member . 
detective <person> here . is that you , <person> ? 
get out of there now ! 
certainly . right over there . 
he has n't . 
is that why you were wandering around at <number> o'clock in the morning ? 
good . 
uh , except for you <person> . i 'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the f word and the n word . 
what ? 
a little business move i made . on my own . i think you 're gon na approve . 
knott ! 
and i you . 
well , you shoot big-time pool , <person> . i mean , that 's what everybody says , you shoot big-time pool . let 's make it <number> hundred dollars a game . 
well , these are slum kids , i was a slum kid , everybody talks like that . 
not <person> , you idiot . <person> . did you hear what he said in oregon ? about me having too much power . 
no . 
let 's just say i 'm freelancing and leave it at that . 
i 'm running late here . i just came back for my briefcase . 
that , sir , does not compute . 
he does n't want to hurt anybody . please leave him alone . 
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie ? yeah , it was . 
you dumb ass , it 's <person> <person> . 
it 's that easy ?

you were n't so bad yourself . 
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you . i seen you over there follerin ' me .

we 'll take 'em in the morning . 
why does everybody say that ? he 's the only person i know who does n't need to use me . 
< u > do you have your passport , sir < /u > ? 
... yes she did . 
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about <number> months ago ? twelve bodies on board . 
no ... for <person> 's sakes , <person> ! 
so ? what 's l.a. like ? 
i should say not ! that was <number> swell story you had in the paper this morning . 
yeah , but i was really not good . 
you 're fucking me . 
it 's over , finished and done with . 
i say you should get a shrink . 
what 's the difference ? you got a pool cue , balls on the table . all you got ta do is get the feel of it . 
and the book says : `` we may by through with the past , but the past ai n't through with us . '' 
your ego is colossal . 
i think it 's really a wonderful piece , <person> ! 
... of the truck that run over your face . 
your dad has <number> computer disks . they have funny names : <person> and <person> . 
even when you were young ? 
only every time i see ya ! come on , i 'll buy you lunch .

thank you for saying that , but no . my business . 
i 've got the check ... 
a few years ago , i actually saw him do `` dracula '' live . i thought he was much scarier in person .

if everyone keeps their mouth shut , there 'll be no <number> going to jail . 
oh no ! not in < u > my < /u > name . 
well ...

no . 
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby . 
hmmm . and how do you like your women ? 
if he was just a man like me , then no . but he 's not . 
did she talk about me ? 
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home . 
no , i 'm sorry , that would n't be possible . we 've just discovered a new skeleton , and - - 
thanks . they were n't related to <person> <person> , were they ? <person> <person> and <person> <person> ? 
it 's not a he , general . it was an article in the `` times '' about a year and a half ago . 
oh , god . 
oh ... and i was afraid we had nothing in common ... 
how can you kill him like that ? 
she married an accountant named <person> <person> . 
yes , but you saidâ€” 
do n't wake the kids ... 
listen to yourself . this is n't a career opportunity . 
the guy . he just came this way . 
i 'm going to be at the dance . 
what ? 
the fog is too heavy , sir . 
i 'm afraid so . 
you 're a career intelligence officer , <person> . you 'll be in the air with us . 
batteries . i planned the generator for the house next week . i wished i had n't waited . this is squawk <number> zero of haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency . can anyone hear me ?

hi , <person> . 
i 've been seeing <person> in chemistry . 
why do n't you come over . and i'11 make dinner . and you bring a movie . and ... we'11 make a night of it ... okay ? 
i do n't feel like i make any impression on people ... at office parties i spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them , so the platters will always look full . i do n't start conversations because i have no idea how to end them ... i think i 'm just meant to live in the background of things . 
do n't whisper it . do n't even think it 
relax , <person> . they were just kids . 
oh , she 's fine . she 's just not coming today . 
excuse me ... 
drop it , jake . 
i always meant to ask , what is it that makes you so special ? why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers ? why you ? 
do you know where the adagio begins ? 
oh , i 've got to give up smoking . <person> ... wait a minute ... <person> slow down . 
uh ? 
well , it has n't been that long . 
there was a message , was n't there ? 
i 'm supposed to be at my old man 's for christmas dinner at <number> . 
small talk . 
whatta you got ? 
i was n't talking about <person> . 
<number> ? 
i called you tuesday at <number> and they said you were n't in . do you remember where you were ? 
naw . those are for us . 
his horns . he files 'em . to `` fit in . '' 
why do they call them training bra 's ? it 's not like learning to ride a bike . 
ever since his unfortunate death , there 's been a surge of interest in his work . i 'll use the profits to restore <person> to her former glory . 
now i 'm awfully glad you asked me that , <person> , because i just happen to have <number> twenties and <number> tens right here in my wallet . i was afraid they were going to be there until next april . so here 's what : you slip me a bottle of bourbon , a glass and some ice . you can do that , ca n't you , lloyd ? you 're not to busy , are you ? 
get something going there . 
are we in some kind of trouble ? 
found them ? in mercea . the coconut 's tropical ! 
looks at <person> , sees him growing weak , starting to sway . he gently tries to move <person> aside . 
oh , i would n't kid you . on the level , it actually happened . <person> bought a paper that day . they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants . 
do n't tell me lies , <person> . que paso ? 
i remember him . got in a car crash or somethin ' . 
are you crazy ? 
you the duff that did n't come up with his end when <person> <person> was sent up ? 
quite a getup for jacking ... 
did you expect him to look you up ? 
hello . would you like to join me , quince and <person> for a nightcap ? 
<person> 's my client . i did it for him and his club , not your boys . 
and tomorrow i 'll give <number> to somebody else . get dressed . get out . 
all right -- what are you ? 
her oxygen would have run out . 
storage , i think . 
you are young , inexperienced . you do not know what time can do . how it can sap all pity , all love . 
you knew . you just did n't care . 
you do n't want to wait it out ? rain should let up soon . 
now we 've got nothing to negotiate with . 
ben , can i say something to you ? 
yes ma'am . 
whyâ€” 
it 's right on <person> <person> and <person> <person> <person> . it 's red brick ... 
couple thousand . most of them evil 
yes , i know the equations -- -i just ca n't see it in my head . 
... that 's probably a more appropriate analogy . 
they 're gone . and there is nothing you or i can do to bring them back . but there is something you can do to help end all this . 
i spend a lot of time on e-bay . buying , selling -- sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up , sometimes just selling crap i find in the street . 
well , now you have . 
no , it does n't . now , remember : you never delivered this . you got caught in the traffic , or something . now , get out of here and do n't let anybody see you . 
we 're at the normandie for a couple of weeks . why do n't you drop around ? 
ai n't gon na wait a minute . 
i got no idea . 
you ? 
you know what would taste good ? chicken . i have n't had chicken in a while . <person> would really hit the spot about now . <person> and beer , definitly , absolutely , without a doubt . where 's a good chicken place around here ? 
you do n't believe me ? you do n't fucking believe me ? 
money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns . because when money and guns get together , there is violence ... 
principal collins is a greater american than <person> <person> will ever be . 
what 's this , what 's this ? ! 
what the hell does that mean ? if i 'd told a ty cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat ? 
and where did you say you were from ? 
it 's where i 've made my home but i do have something for you . . . 
it expects a return signal now , ordering it to transmit that information to the creator . 
and i certainly ca n't say it 's pleasant . 
you 've got to face the things you feel . 
i â€™ m talking about the best schools in the country here , kate ... 
nothing . 
uh-huh . 
kill me ? well , alright . go ahead . take the empire . all yours . <person> , <person> , old pals . i 'll kill me for you . 
approximately <number> hundred thirty <number> . 
right . if you believe in god . as a narcissist , <person> could n't blame himself for the alleged murders . he created the voices after the fact . in order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides <person> <person> and that <person> <person> needs to pay . 
i 've been planning on kissin ' you for a very long time . 
oh , <person> ... kyle . i need you so much . 
i will .

gaston would never tell me . it was asubject not to be spoken of , captain . 
i just hope it was worth <number> hundred bucks . 
i 've arranged for him to work with us . 
a book , huh ? i guess that means you can read ... an ' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms ... but then , like you told old <person> there , you ai n't armed , are you , <person> ?

i 'm not being defensive . 
i miss dad . 
what happened to those disks i gave you , have you still got them ? 
sometimes people think they lose things and they did n't really lose them . it just gets moved . 
i know ... 
<number> units in <number> days . how many spares do we have ? 
what about the girl ? <person> , athletic , sleazy and demure ; just like you specified . is that a coincidence ? 
you 're going to jump on me . i know you 're going to jump on me -- like <person> jumped on poppea . 
you believe me , right ? 
mother too . <person> case it was . the young lady just could n't make it through labor . never even saw her son .

why did you marry me , <person> ? why did we have these <number> children ? you do n't need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it does n't love you like we do . 
but i only had sex with <person> .

you and <person> and cole , and even <person> , get all these girls because you 're good looking and famous . you do n't have to pay . they just look at me like i 'm the baby brother . do n't tell anyone , okay <person> ? 
you are good to me sam . 
from a slipped disc ? that 'd be a first . 
to organize things . meetings and travel ... whenever they come here , i handle details . 
wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars , we 'll be there , this fine ship , this fine crew . never give up , never surrender ! 
it sure is ! ! 
there is no god . but i hope someone looks after you . 
i will stop this car right now . 
'cause they 're getting a divorce . that 's why they sent me here . my sister 's at tabor . they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business . 
you drop this bombshell on me . why did n't you tell me before ? 
you trying to hurt my feelings ? 
i do n't think so . 
no it is n't . they do n't trust the people that feel this way . but these people are right . and the kennedys are wrong . we need you to tell 'em , <person> . they 'll listen to you . 
you 're referring to the defense 's efforts to prove that <person> <person> is tormented by `` demonic voices ? '' 
up yours . 
bobo , no , i -- 
yeah ! ... anyway , i do n't like hotels . too much people , everyone 's got the key ... i do n't like it .

he was a president . 
oh , baby , you cruel ...

<person> <number> marks ... <number> can travel -- <number> 's happiness might depend on fourteen <number> marks -- do n't you think so , <person> ? 
but he wo n't shoot you right then ? 
just think about <number> thing right now : what color ? 
he 's dead . 
when you cut yourself pounding the door , did it hurt ? 
so i hope you wo n't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice . 
no , he covets . that 's his nature . and how do we begin to covet , <person> ? do we seek out things to covet ? make an effort to answer . 
have you got the will ? 
go on -- out with you . 
oh-you-beccha . 
not to mention ketchup and hot peppers . 
yeah ... i guess . any of other panthers know about this ? 
yeaup , but those grosses are inflated . 
for <number> . best known for the `` tragedy and blood '' genre , this author-playwright -- 
you sure ? 
uh -- <person> <person> 's residence ? 
i 'm hip . 
i know enough . 
to find the man in black , obviously . 
i feel like a bootlegger 's wife . look !

but it may be nothing ; garbled communications . why do n't you ... 
oh ... hi , <person> .

well they always is to the party concerned . 
i do n't care . we 've got ta stop her . 
is there a gun pointing at you ? 
aquittal . 
reality tv and stay by the phone . that 's what all wives-in-crime do ... 
merle , hey <person> , you got any socks ? 
i also promised <person> . 
we wo n't have to . 
yeah , sorry i missed it . i guess you guys did n't know about the dress code here . it 's really kind of a coat and tie place . 
hey , that sounds interesting . you like it ? 
i 'm looking for someone . <person> <person> . i 'm a police inspector from <person> <person> , gen su district . <person> <person> is a master criminal . i hear she infiltrated the yus . she must have come with them when they transferred here . but with <person> 's reputation , i ca n't just go in and accuse her . 
why me , man ? 
i know . you introduced <person> to us -- but how could you tell â€”- 
we ran a search on relatives . he has a cousin in town -- clarence teal . smalltime thief . last known address was on pine street . he moved out a month ago . we 've got a couple leads on him to check out . 
she 'll never be yours ! she said my name ! she remembers ! 
what for ? protective purposes ? 
there 's a rumor that you were tryin ' to get somebody to beat me up . 
pretty nice . 
i know . i went down to the barrett house . but she 's gone . they drove her and the kids to north tahoe airport . 
make a thousand of 'em . still wo n't be enough by the time i 'm through . 
it 's not your fault , <person> . the letter i wrote you , they -- 
sue , i 've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps . and this is the biggest step yet . if it helps , think of this as a promotion . a merger of sorts ... <number> little words that can change our lives ... 
certainly illustrates the diversity of the word . 
then it wo n't go after the others ? 
i am actually ... glad to see you 've finally shown your true colors . 
have him committed . 
get on the bus . 
i 'll put this right through your head . 
i 'm thinking about the kid . i 'm sure he 'd do a good job for you . 
<person> 's been out here too long , man . i 'm taking him to ceremonial burial . 
what good is it ? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons . pretty vague . where do you start looking ? maybe if the tablet were intact , you 'd have something to go on . but the entire top portion is missing . 
beautiful . 
no , i do n't want to because they yell . and i 've got news for you too . 
you think i 'm kidding . you 're the most fallible , wrong-headed , self- deluding , just generally benighted jackass i 've ever known . yet , withal , even at your worst , you 're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope . 
try not to be late because kids don â€™ t like to be the last one picked up . 
pommeroy . 
my husband took the kids to the illinos state fair . my daughter 's entering a prize steer . 
<person> christ . i know who the dominant personality is . lindenmeyer . 
that is none of your business . 
mrs. christian . 
it 's his birthday present , and you closed the beach , honey . i told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday . i do n't believe he 'll ever do it again . 
did to . 
we can hope . you still have your job , right ? 
stop ! stop it , this afternoon was not what you thought ... i overheard you and <person> , at the side of the mess hall , your idea about the `` test '' ... do you believe me ? 
did he try to ? 
no , i did n't . 
when i was ten , my old man threw a bottle at my mother . i guess i got in the way . 
geez , <person> was killed . who do we send the thank you note to ? 
over at tri-tech . <number> of the jobs professor <person> set me up with . i have n't told him yet , but i talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy . 
it was the best , kid 
no , i 'm not . <person> , i 'm offended at the accusation . 
i 've told you ten times -- if i had anything they could n't bat down in a second , do n't you suppose i'd 've been up in that hearing yelling murder ! sure -- he was cooked the night i sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works ! 
well , there are , but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night . 
then let 's have it . 
oh ... nothing . thirty pounds . i just have n't been very hungry . 
yeah , he went south ahead of us . i guess we 'll catch him before ... 
uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ? 
just shut up , <person> did n't kill <person> . 
honestly , you 'd do if only you had the buck teeth . 
do you have any idea how difficult that 's gon na be ? 
actually , the engines are smes . hydrogenbase , carbon propellant . couple generations past your last ride . i 'm not as dumb as you look . 
what if they 're naughty ? 
i 'm making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does n't bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull . 
yes , <person> <person> . 
let 's get a couple drinks , okay ? hey , take a look behind us . do you think that car is followin ' us ?

give me a drag . 
`` terminate with extreme prejudice . '' 
be back in a minute . if <person> calls you , just tell him i went to embers . oh , geez - 
suicide . i just needed to set the record straight . 
that 's a `` rookies '' doll . <person> <person> <person> . we got ta lotta dolls . they 're real cool . did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in `` the black hole '' ? i always found it funny somewhere there 's a kid playin ' with a little figure of <person> <person> .

uh-huh . 
there 's a machinist outside who 'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job . 
no accident . i tried to warn all of you about <person> . 
good , good . drinking some good wines and kicking back , you know . so what 's happening ? still no word ? 
blood sample ? how close did you get to that thing ?

it 's your time mister . fifteen minutes ai n't long . that cigarette burns out , your time is up . 
it 's from hunger . 
<person> , i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside -â€” where it matters . i wanted it that day too , but did n't dare tell you . 
do you remember his name ? 
did you see it ? 
equally incongruous is <person> becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas - all rabid anti- communists . 
see ? you 're ashamed . you know you 're out of shape . take my card . i can help you tone that body up in no time . get you on an aerobics and free-weights program . 
fron kon steen !

<person> < i > <person> <person> < /i > ? <person> had all his best ideas in prison . 
well , it 's up to us then , is n't it ? 
let me have it . `` aboard the s.s. manchuria . last night <person> seemed to recover his memory . kept talking about shangri- la , telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet . insisted upon returning there at once . locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore . am leaving ship myself to overtake him , as fearful of his condition . wrote down details of conway 's story about shangri-la which i am forwarding . <person> <person> . '' 
sure . why do n't you bring her up to my office at <number> tomorrow afternoon . 
it 's from <number> of those p.o . <person> . <person> was the trip ? 
do you understand ? my stuff is mine , his stuff is ours . i 'm taking half of his commissions -- now , you work it out . 
do n't worry about it . 
man , you been locked up too long , everybody conks . all the cats . 
of course i 'm scared .

rain . 
you make it sound so simple ... 
yes -- i 'm on a good streak , thanks .

that 's just another part of the price to pay . 
uh , i think so . in the mental hospital . 
yeah . 
you 've < u > got < /u > something , there ... 
i know you do . good luck to you , too . 
your mistake was n't making something fake , daddy . we 're fine with fake -- as long as you do n't lie about it . 
<number> , counting the <number> in the chamber . 
yeah ... sid ? 
i was drinking a little in those days . i 'm drinking a little these days too . 
underbelly ! 
yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ? 
what , though ? it ca n't be the republicans -- he 'd never allow something as stupid as this , not when he 's gon na slaughter mcgovern anyway . 
but who 's gon na help me here with the house and in the field ? 
uh , no ... i mean , not that often - 
good luck . that guy 's been in there since i got here . 
it is for me . 
a strange threat . i can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . pity about <person> <person> . 
very little . 
are you a carpenter , <person> <person> ? herbert shakes his head . 
<person> had alibis too . 
i 'm seeing what a busy man does . 
of what ? 
should we wake him up ? 
good night . 
what are you doing ? 
well , do you ? 
you do n't have to beat me , <person> . just try to keep up . 
you must bring something heavy to the deal . 
<person> , i 'm sorry i upset you yesterday , but you must understand what is going on . 
that 's right . <person> . <person> , i want you to know what we 're talking about here . this is n't like tv only better . this is life . it 's a piece of somebody 's life . <person> and uncut , straight from the cerebral cortex . you 're there . you 're doing it , seeing it , hearing it ... feeling it . 
you did n't say that about the food ? 
i do n't know ... some people are okay , but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody . 
but you used to say -- 
sure . are you kidding ? sure . 
shake hands with your daddy . 
... the big apple , new york , new york . 
downstairs . there must be an extension . oh my god -- 
you were trying to make me look bad . 
but they never will , <person> . no matter how many elections you win , they never will . 
certainly . but now the children of the night are calling me . 
yes . come out , i know you 're in there 
i left a fingerprint ! you fucking people . 
what ? 
you know why ? because it 'll be an < u > excuse < /u > ! it 'll be `` bernie laplante excuse number four thousand one hundred and six . '' no , four thousand one hundred and twelve . that 's how many excuses you have given me , i keep track of them electronically . i heard them all , bernie . 
<person> dillon . 
but i do n't listen ... then i 'd be crazy . 
i know . 
i wish i had an answer . <person> is powerful , more so every day it seems . but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us . 
like he meant it . 
and watch her til <number> -- i 've got to edit . 
well perhaps better than my first . 
<person> . old habits . 
that whole ... 
not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick <number> . 
<number> days ? we could kill 'em tomorrow . 
where were you ? 
i hope you 'll be very happy . 
of course i am . what kind of question is that ? 
could be raining ! 
what 's the point of staying ? all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs . no one 's ever going to take me seriously . the people at law school do n't , <person> does n't -- i do n't even think my parents take me seriously . they wanted me to grow up and become a victoria 's secret model who marries a rock star . now , for the first time , it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living . but i was kidding myself -- <person> did n't see me as a lawyer . he saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else . it turns out , i am a joke . 
they 're still our friends , <person> . it 's nothing serious . you kid about them all the time ... and i could tell <person> really appreciated me being there . 
did you say anything to mrs. driscoll ? 
sure . 
we need him back . 
not saw , heard ... heard . i heard the brakes . wham ! and i got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er ... er <person> ... that 's <person> <person> <person> <person> . 
as for the blankets , you will notice they are very warm . <person> percent wool . 
you were on the indianapolis ? in <number> ? <person> ... 
so they said . 
enough romance . 
there 's only <number> key . 
that 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . but ... she did n't fool my mother . 
<person> said , sir . 
i know where to find it . taking possession be another matter . 
... the red piece of shit over there ... 
she used to be so friendly . 
i 've been going over and over my experience last night . it was amazing . i 've decided i 'm a transsexual . is n't that the craziest thing ? 
that 's what i told you then . only he did n't . <person> killed him . 
maybe we can study together or something . 
i ca n't ... could n't . 
and terror , if you do n't mind . 
dig it , you know those brothers over in san fran ... call themselves the black panthers too ? 
the fools ! <person> ... 
what are you running away from ? 
also identical ? 
it was so cool . he did n't say a word . he was just ... ready , you know ? and we did n't kiss or talk or anything . he just sat there and let me do all the work . 
so if you 're not running and <person> <person> is there to see it , then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending , right ? all we 're doing is turning lemon into lemonade . 
what ? to put <number> of these in my pocket ? 
come on , <person> . my relationship with <person> has obviously disturbed you a great deal . 
my ballet recital . 
i lent it to a friend of mine . he took it up to palm springs . 
we can do all of that later , but first you need to calm down . 
passed out ? ca n't hang , huh ? boy , i knew you was a lightweight . passed out on <number> funky ass blunt . they do n't make 'em like they used to , baby . 
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure . 
i did . <person> to the cent. $ <number> . <person> wondered though what mrs. <person> got for my brother <person> <person> <person> of been more than <number> hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost <number> years . but then they hung my other brother <person> a. up on a tree so i guess he was n't worth the same..i wonder what was <person> <person> worth ? and <person> ? i was n't surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti . her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost . a breeder . 
<person> ... get dejesus ' suit on the `` sick rack '' and do a diagnostics . any other suit problems she should know about ? 
chaos . 
that 's real big of you . 
ding dong ? oh ding <person> <person> , eh ? 
i called her up . 
i mean the mercury flight . it 's not safe and , <person> , you know why . 
you 're absolutely right about the cossacks . we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts . they had such reliable guns . 
i will close . <person> , <person> , ten percent . i can get hot . you know that ... 
oh , i do n't know , maybe because our lives depend on it , i just sort of thought you knew what you were doing ! 
she talks a great deal and smiles a lot . she 's very pretty , she has a real good figure . she 's very girlish or womanish , if you know what i mean . she would n't hurt anybody , this girl . she could n't . 
yeah . 
no . 
<number> is the future , <person> . this is <number> . 
wait here . do n't move . 
i 'm flattered . and congratulations to you , of course . 
i 'll kill you , you fuckin ' faggot ! you mind your own business . now get out ! now , before i get too mad to turn back . 
harvey . you need me . since you 've gotten out of arkham , you 've managed , what ? to bungle stealing a safe ? wreck a statue ? and , correct me if i 'm wrong here , but were n't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus ? 
do n't you know ? 
all this must be quite a change from <person> <person> . 
so i 've noticed . 
oh god , i do n't think so . 
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they 're home . <person> why they do n't like me ? 
got ta go , <person> . 
i like you as much as i can like anyone who thinks i 'm an asshole . 
m 'm . 
his paws are frozen and he can not walk . 
holy shit , i 've been going out with a loaded gun ! 
right now . 
or what ? no one can capture ivy but the big bad bat . <person> ! you just want her for yourself . do n't you ? answer me , damn it ! 
i 'm not playing any games ! go look at lynette 's ! 
what 's the other <number> ? 
smooth . i know this is dangerous and everything but it 's kind of fun . ever see `` <person> , '' you know when <person> and <person> are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says ... i forget what they said but it 's pretty funny . 
come on . let me buy you something to eat . <person> like you could use the company . 
the whole thing is my fault . i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding . you understand me . 
she is well . she is - well , actually , i 'm about to become a father ! she only told me last night . you are the first to know . 
`` during heat episodes of <number> kelvin or higher , <person> breaks down and dissipates . will consume magnesium '' . 
afraid of the hospital ? 
a small victory is n't that small when you 've been use to losing . 
it has to be . gravitational fields were in flux ... it must have soft landed ... ! 
do n't you remember ? he 's the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust , and gave out a statement that they were all sane . it created a sensation ! 
how do you know ? 
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ... 
why do people go to war ? 
waste magic on revenge ? you have much to learn , <person> ... 
no , i do n't . 
who ? 
... yer ducts . 
<number> ... <number> ... 
calm down , <person> ... 
you 're right . you 're right . of course , <number> does n't want to boast . it 's a classic case of technology in search of an artist . that 's all you 've been waiting for , an artist with integrity , with a vision , who can see . 
look , i know what you must be thinking ! poor little rich girl . what does she know about misery ? 
do n't call me brother . 
i feel faint . 
before i do -- i was hoping we might be alone , <person> . 
no , your honor . 
well , that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first . 
[ so am i , <person> . ] 
this ai n't <person> . <person> been shot . this man <person> been resurrected ... 
no problem . my husband gets up the crack of dawn . it 's his kidneys . 
you did . you 're right .

you 're going to your ship , i 'm going to mine . <person> <person> . i 've got <number> years of catch-up learning to do . 
what 's the big idea ?

i 'm a drunkard . 
<person> <person> ratched ! 
damn . now i got ta go in early . 
someone you loved very much . 
and that lot 's never happier than when they 're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat , i 'd like to know . 
if the head was moving fast enough , but i do n't see how it could be . 
`` and this too shall pass away . ''

<person> laplante , i really want to help you , but crazy stories are only going to make it worse . the d.a . is asking your bail be set at twenty-five <number> dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail ... 
what did she say ? 
how do i discuss operations over an open line ? 
goodbye . 
you may still . somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise . 
yes sir ... we 've received information about a band of comanches under a chief named <person> ...

i 'm not a kid anymore , i ca n't be all over the map -- 
the official term is `` psychotic '' . 
get real . i 'm faster than you . 
tell it with ... 
`` paid vindication '' that 's what i call justice .

what is this ? where 's reed ? 
basic . <person> . 
where are the antihistamines ? 
'68 . 
you 're supposed to watch me and entertain me , and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood .

we should charge ! does n't anyone have a job to do ? 
we captured the plans in a raid on the imperial shipyards , but we fell under attack before i could get the data to safety , so i hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off . 
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization . 
<number> time <person> scored forty-eight points , and they only had <number> minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth .

it is not my fault , <person> <person> . i could do it yesterday . 
he 'll never let us go . 
< u > what < /u > ? 
yea ! 
he said he did n't want that life no more . he 'd been saving to buy a farm . he was sorry i got sick . but pretty excited to get back his father 's place . 
should i ? 
sure . of course . 
i think i can handle that <number> . 
you 're too modest . 
the thing about kids is , they 're so ... young ! they do n't know nothin ' yet . when you 're a kid , you think you 're gon na grow up an ' be a `` wonderful person '' instead of an asshole , like everybody else . 
talia , you know how important our friendship is to me and i would never do anything to ... 
the name is <person> . and it was your idea in the first place . 
cheerleading . for ... sporting events , yes ? 
why , yes , <person> , i do . once again , we joined <person> in the search for her identity . as you know , she 's been brainwashed by the evil <person> -- 
raw ? 
easy come , easy go . 
what the hell are you doing ? 
it changes . there are eleven levels . each <number> is a different layer of the arcade universe . the concept is , you 're entering the video game itself , making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade 's brain . 
it 's the biggest on earth ! i swear ! it 's a 50-foot airstream -- they do n't make them any longer than that . 
i do n't understand <person> . he 's just not like this . 
okay , i 'm thinking . 
alright , if you really want to go down this road , well girl 's like chocolate . 
shoulda written , <person> ... 
no shit ? 
yes . but it was once the figurehead of a slave ship . that 's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery . for generations they found life a burden . that 's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial . 
i paid for that . 
yes . <person> ! 
what 's the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ? 
so do i. as a matter of fact , i spent <number> years at the sheboygan conservatory of music . 
nothing you ca n't show up for with a stain . 
i did n't say it was bad for you , it 's just kind of sickening , that 's all . 
<number> a year since i was twelve . you do the math . 
all right . i 'll do it . i 'll do it . 
she ca n't be wrong . she 's a very very very powerful sorceress . 
you want to book the flight ? 
soon then . i â€™ ll save the last dance for you . 
let me look at it . 
there are n't hotels ? 
words . 
you little shit . when did they get to you ? 
i bet . 
you could buy it on payments . 
yeah , i tried you at home . did you get my message ? 
catholicism is not on trial here . i want you to deal with <person> without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else ... 
we could stop at the hilton by the airport . 
<person> <person> 's wife became a buddhist , not a christian . 
uh , so that a vaccine can be developed that will , uh , allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth . 
did you hit her ? 
and this <number> , in case you have n't guessed , is <person> . 
you 're supposed to be hiding out ! 
somebody stole it . 
<person> 's escaped . <person> 's in him . 
how can you say it ? 
yeah . <person> ? would you , uh , tell claire the , uh , the `` thoughts '' you 've been ... 
what are you going to do , get married ? have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats ! and go around scrubbing the -- 
the marriage is off . now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life . 
good , what are you going to do ? do you come back ? 
she 's in the holding cell , on this floor . 
sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they do n't believe the words anymore . 
you said you were on leave for the fourth . 
and you have him ? 
does n't satisfy , eh ? well -- that 's too bad ... . 
great . 
what was that ? i 'm sorry , i did n't catch it . would you repeat it ? 
- any more than being the son of captain neilsen does ! 
see . there 's an example . i do n't know whether you 're being cute or crazy now . 
keri ... . <person> ... how about if i just call you mom ? 
i 've got a little challenge for you , <person> -- a new recruit . he 's a tough case , but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games ... let him hope for a while ... and blow him away . 
my period ? no . 
i 'd put my money on that vigo character . 
i have n't had a chance to think . first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there . and after we got away , i 've just been dealin ' with him . 
just dinner and dance , right ? 
did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road . 
your hair looks -- well fabulous . 
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman . 
i don ' t know . it 's someplace down in there ... . ..deep.. a big door ... a wheel ... . 
adopted . i should have know . of course . if it was a snake , it 'd bit me ! 
calmer than you are . 
when , may i ask ? 
i 'm not . he does walk funny . do n't you see that ? 
you did n't complain about the racial policies , just about the musical standards , is that right ? 
i 'm not gay . 
blow it up ? 
thanks just the same . 
i guess most people are . 
ja , ja . 
what ? 

soran does n't care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus . 
and the result satisfies . 
i do n't need your gratitude . 
that 's why you got scared when mrs. <person> hired me . you knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . how 'd you find me ? 
my pleasure . 
there 's a poison in the upper classes , <person> . they 've had it too soft . too many cars , too many color tvs ... 
this is where we belong , <person> . on top of the world . top of the world ! 
<person> could help him . if we can get in touch with <person> , <person> could get him to a doctor , <person> could get a doctor to come and see him . 
really ? i do n't work with violent cases , i work with children . but even a kid lies . they love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true . do n't you think <person> would do the same ? 
it is . it 's very warm . i wonder how long it will last ? 
the baby ? 
that 's news to me . i 'd better cable my wife . 
you promise ? 
it 's running our records ! starfleet strength , earth defenses ... 
<person> , cancel your mental appointments , baby . what are you , like still stoned from last night ? 
we need more - 
i 'll be able to do a search , to find out who lived here previously . and who died here . 
i shall need a small plane . 
oh , god , what ? 
no , no ... there 's plenty for everybody ... oh , <person> , this is <person> ... and the frog brothers ... 
the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate . so what 's wrong ? 
an ex-cop that does n't carry . it 's embarrassing . i oughta not be seen with you . hey , mace . what 's goin ' on ? 
in another time , another dimension . it was brought here long ago by the `` nathadians '' , a people who are now all but extinct . they built an impenetrable stone <person> to store the power and keep it from their enemies . for thousands of years , beings from all over the universe have tried to obtain it ... all have perished . 
great ! bring 'em in ! <person> , i got ta run . 
you shut your mouth ! you shut your mouth now ! 
i do n't know . 
or twenty-four as it is in earth time . furthermore , if you will reveal yourself , your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable : by hurting the people you care for . ah , this earth ... this world you live in , kal-el ... resist its temptations , its rewards , especially its political system . 
gee , i did n't recognize you ... i 've never seen you laugh before . that your brother makin ' the rabbit ears ? 
i 'm not really a musician . 
it 's lonely in there , in my room . 
quitting your therapy wo n't feed the children of ethiopia . 
does that work ? 
i cursed then all ! 
it 's just to the corner , mam . in broad daytime . nothing can happen . i 'll be there to protect you . 
so whoever built this -- 
... after you ' re dead . and when i give the word , do you understand ... when i give the < u > word < /u > ... 
left you this place . 
and i had to widen a few doors . you 'll see . 
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them . 
... looks like a convention . 
<person> i hit <person> . 
this you 're familia ' with . 
do n't be silly , <person> . 
i ca n't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried . 
what is it ? 
'cause that 's how long it 's gon na take , baby . 
you want to change rooms ? 
alright . what about me ? 
bank robbery . 
never knew my father . i grew up with my mother . actually , i grew up around my mother . she was great though . i mean , the way she was with her friends ... she was this woman who had so much life in her , she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us . [ <person> ] she died young . 
well , why do n't they put him away ? prisons do n't want him . i took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again . 
this is n't like playin ' winos on the street . you got ta do more than outrun the guy . 
about the time paradox . how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- 
yeah . maybe . 
i 'm outta here . 
forget it . <person> , team , let 's break it up and get ready for the kick-off . 
the fourteenth of may . 
oh ... <person> ! 
no . i 'll be right back . 
you 're roommates ? 
-- well -- not going in and out , i do n't mean just that . why are you asking me ? you went with <person> longer than i have . 
i 'm sure he 's busy . 
i don't.. 
he could 've called first . 
no , it is . it 's just <number> more thing to add to your `` things that make you a better person than me '' list . 
yah , i think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates . dlr ? 
we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours . what was the dream about ? 
there 's this whispering campaign against me ever since <person> won at saratoga . 
sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel ... <number> you probably could n't even sell ... what would you need to get away , to start a new business , somewhere else ? forty <number> dollars ? 
what 's the matter with you ... ? ! what kind of person are you ... ? ! 
no . 
an ' if i spot 'em ? 
if i stop ... there 'll be no more talk of divorce ? 
what 's in the <number> week package ? 
by giving liberty unto thine eyes ; <person> other beauties . why , romeo , art thou mad ? 
you and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man did n't kill his wife . we 're <number> of the most frightening ghouls i 've ever known . 
and we intend to use them ! 
yes , dr scott . a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter . 
you 're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular . 
it 's really not a bad place . it just needs a woman 's touch . 
it 's early yet . 
<person> , you 're a real jerk-off . 
do n't drink up all of yours , 'cause you are n't getting any of ours . 
shit , this ai n't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it . i was a fixin ' on trading it to <person> <person> . 
kronos , sir ? 
but the dance is in the gymnasium . 
well shut it off at once ! 
alright . this is your penance . say <number> rosaries and ... be careful , <person> . reflect on your life . 
all right , darling . 
and a glass . 
not at all . 
and you must be <person> . please do n't get up . 
what ? where is she ? 
as per mother 's instructions . 
i do n't know ... <number> of us has to be here in case <person> 's on the way . 
you just said it . he 's my friend . nothing else to say . 
you aim a gun at me ? ! do you know who i am ? ! i am <person> <person> . you understand ? 
okay . 
not really . i 'm sixteen . i 'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes ! 
wolf-slayer , worm-sticker ... give a cheer for the champion ! 
benjamin -- do you find me undesirable ? 
get a girlfriend . 
that 's it . that 's the end . 
it 's up to you entirely . do n't leave , then ... 
i think ... he was just a real interestin ' fella to have around . 
shit yeah ! 
who am i thinking of ? 
finished ! 
wait . <person> . here comes dad . 
i do n't understand . 
he would have liked that . 
i 'll do what i have to do , for princess lili 's sake ! 
so ? 
whose ratings were higher ? 
what were you talking about ... ? 
oh , let 's assume that they have . 
have they proceeded with their experiments ? 
well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong . it was < u > <person> 's < /u > boat that was dead in the water . or he 'd never have put up the lantern . 
to apologize . 
and i ai n't no nigger either ! 
oh god . i know . i know . 
i gave him steady employment -- 
i asked around . 
yes . 
i said good night ! 
a man came by the house . a psychiatrist by the name of loomis . 
c'mon , you know how they do . <person> man comes in with ten <number> , they wan na fuck with 'em . first off , they gon na wan na know where i got it . second , they gon na keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin ' that court cost shit . <person> that shit , <person> . i 'll go through you .

okay , thanks . 
hi . 
what 's this , how did this happen ? 
my birthright ? you mean , like a trust fund ? 
good to meet you . again . 
< u > captain < /u > ... <person> , would n't say that ... likely you had your reasons for killin ' <person> ... probably needed killin ' ... i 'm speaking as a ranger now , not as a reverend ... fact that all <number> was shot in the back is the only thing that 's raised some question -- that and a missin ' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise . 
well , that just happens to be exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm eh ... i 'm outlining a new writing project , and eh ... 
you really think we hurt him that bad ? 
hmmmm . he 'll be in the zen room . 
if you 're any friend at all , you 'll stop talking like that ! 
this is not a joke . <person> <person> <person> does n't know . it would really have hurt her feelings . 
yes , <person> ratched ! 
sit down . i do n't want to trouble you , just want to ask ... 
on my way . the cases are hooked up and ready . 
i 'm sorry . is this a problem ? 
except i ca n't get you out of my head , <person> . 
the crew ? could they still be alive ? 
well you 've got ta be prepared . 
michael , <person> 's in the house with <person> . he asked for you , and <person> said he could n't see you . 
underneath . somewhere . 
never heard of the place . 
i understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while i radio back to hq - 
you 've been married twice -- 
i 'll give ya ten . 
some people are n't the athletic type . 
they 're nines . 
i see . well , thank you very much . you 've been very , very nice . 
something i could n't show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i 'd just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i 've never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body . 
i plan on liquidating almost evetything . 
i 'm here , ai n't i ? 
oh , i hope so my darling . but let me switch on the light . 
you did ! ! 
stacy . how many times do i have to tell you ? you are really going to be beautiful ... someday . 
you wan na talk to her alone ? 
how can you say that when you do n't know him ! 
he 's here somewhere . find him . the sub 's on it 's way . go ! c'mon ! 
and then some people you do n't like right off . it 's funny . you know why i want you to play ball with me ? 
no , sir . 
... please , i just do n't want it ... . 
with <person> ? 
what word did you leave last night ? 
uh-huh . 
seems like everyone 's getting married . a year ago it was all divorces . now it 's all weddings . <person> , i guess . 
what do you mean , <person> ? 
truth is , i 've been thirsty my whole life . never really known why . 
and what is ... this frozen moment ? 
i do n't know , but do n't call me <person> . 
you understand ? 
want to come again and stay 
what have you got , <person> ? 
i 'm listening . 
you appear at his side out-of-the- blue , stay at his house , eat dinner with his family , it 's practically a first . you 're in the red-hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular <person> . 
are you talking to me ! 
yes , stop ! i wondered if you could find out anything about what 's happening . what 's wrong ? 
not liberalism . equanimity . 
that depends . 
no , no , it calms you , makes everything nice and smooth . just takes the edge off like a beer , but in a fraction of the time . 
okay . <person> . here 's what you do . 
and she 's never wrong . 
smell ? uh , something like methylcyanoacrylate . 
home . away from here . i 've got porters to take us back . 
you know everything i know , plus what you 've taught yourself -- you 're a better doctor then i am and you know it ! 
i do n't know ... i know you are right . i do n't know that this is right . 
you 've probably never done an honorable thing in your life . 
and -- there 's no talking her out of it . believe me , i 've tried . 
nuke wo n't go to bed with you , eh ? 
all right . maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this . 
<person> . 
no . 
when are we going out ? you and me ? 
if your expenses run higher i hope you 'll trust us for it . 
hey , <person> . 
i rather thought so . and before that , had you ever seen the gun ? 
that 's my business . 
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ? 
no . 
i dunno.. 
it 's not something i can explain now . perhaps someday . 
no , he would n't . 
yeah , but what about me and <person> ? i did n't see our names on that pardon . you said you were gon na put in a good word for us . 
as friends -- always as friends . 
why what ? 
you 've been holding out on me pendergast . you have a suspect capable of this ? 
i 'm sorry for losing it back there , but you must remember , sister , you have vows to god as well as a mission to the world . 
then scream for me . a repeat performance . let me see how easy you can turn it on . <person> ! i want to hear you scream for me ! 
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow . i mean , <person> ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves . 
y'know , i treated him better than any other probie i ever had . he probably hates my guts , but i did the best thing for him . i made him finally look in the mirror . 
i 'm terribly sorry , <person> <person> <person> . 
yes , sir . 
like i said , it was like i was there . i remember everything . the sounds of the crashes , the smells , the look on shaina 's face ... 
fine . 
no really , it 's a fable . the 'guardian of good ' dreams . it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up . 
i never been to montana ... acquaintance of mine has , but i had n't ... never had any reason to . 
how do you know you saw it ? 
why are you here ? 
what do you mean , i handed her ? the patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street . 
yeah . 
yes . < u > yes < /u > . <person> trouble .. ? 
i 'm sorry , sir . a year ago there was a fire in the old <person> <person> . this is the new <person> <person> . 
how old are you ? 
congratulations , you 've penetrated a bastion of male privilege . i guessed you were n't a stickler for tradition , doctor . 
you stole from them , you lied to me . how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ? 
nick ! ! ! 
i see . i 'll get together <number> patrols of our detectives for action tonight . 
this time with me ! 
i 'm glad it was me . 
stop messing with my life <person> . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right . 
maybe ! is it impossible ? 
indeed it is . 
there is no public offering . the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo . 'wrote this just to run their web site . 
what if you do n't close ... ? 
we took them from the dead . now -- i assume you want to rest , to shower . we 'll attend to your repairs after dinner . 
yes i know . 
columbia . 
<person> did . 
sailor ! ! ! !

we 'll get you whatever you want . get that other kid . we might need him . 
greenpeace . 
you getting scared ? 
there , there , lie quiet now . you just had a bad dream . 
i mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty . 
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex ? 
both would be nice . 
no , he takes after his mother ... 
since his beard was red . 
that 's not why you came . 
brother , i hear you talkin ' . 
grateful for your candor , <person> . 
and what did he say ? 
god , how i have looked forward to this , honey . 
okay then ... let 's get ya started . 
nothing , thank heaven . 
same old reed . all analysis , no action . was n't that the problem with you <number> ? 
okay , you were right . i hated my column , but i can do this assignment . 
tomorrow i go with vince . 
the hard part ... 
you would n't have an extra ticket there ? 
ca n't imagine by who . i do n't suppose the truth would interest you : that i 've never had another wife but evelyn . 
shut up and turn to page <number> . 
should have at least gotten the map off of him . blows up with him then we did all this for nothing . 
i thought it was spanish that you spoke ? 
i like that . are n't we supposed to wish on it ? 
i am so sorry , <person> <person> . i wanted to be an actor . i am sorry , <person> . 
no you did n't , you ai n't provin'it . 
i better see you get there .

queer ? 
i 'll take care of that . 
well , is n't it -- ? 
yeah -- she did a good job . this glass looks brand-new . 
you could be a touch warmer , though . admit it , against your better judgment you think i 'm all right . 
i remember when you was a little girl <person> . you come back from the movies and you 'd say - mama that ending was so sad ... and i 'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in hollywood . and you believed me . 
what the heck they doin ' ? 
hear you roar ... 
like a leech . 
because you always obey orders ... 
i made macaroni . 
prove it ! 
what do you think ? 
he 'd call it habit . but now ... i get the feeling he 's going through the motions a bit . 
do n't look at me , <person> . i shoot when i see the whites of the eyes . you like me ? 
you do n't have to prove anything . 
do n't look for him . he 's doing fine . he 's got ta girl . he 's fuckin ' her right now in steven 's parents ' room . so do ya know <person> . 
how did i get stuck with you as a moving buddy ? 
i do n't appreciate your ruse , ma'am . 
it 's a bet -- come on , sally ! 
what ? 
you are home . there are lots of kids you still know here .

she 's just a damn road hugger , <person> . plus the man can drive . 
oh , i 've been just dying to meet you , <person> <person> ! 
why would they -- 
what would happen if i threw him into the core ? 
do n't tell me you 're naked back there .

that son of a bitch ... do n't get me wrong , he 's a fine writer . 
yeah , i remember . you said that before . 
my colors ? 
nothing , <person> . 
dwayne ?

the 'maze ' ? you mean the air ducts ? 
what 's his name ? 
we had abused every rule that <person> lived by -- burning the locals , abusing the tourists , terrifying the help . the only chance now , i felt , was the possibility that we 'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it . 
no , i 'm lost . 
you 're flushed . and you were moaning . i think you 're running a fever . what are you doing ?

he did sometimes . 
come with us , daddy . please come with us ! 
what do i do , then , look in the bleedin ' <person> pages ? 
i 'm saying i handled my responsibilities like a man . but when you 're in the nba , you pull into a city and there 's a hundred women waiting at the hotel . and another twenty that made it past security on your floor . and the boldest one is standing right at your door . and after awhile , it just becomes part of the game . i 'm sorry i lied to you , i should n't have . but i did it cause i love you . 
no . <person> , if this is another <number> of your fantasies ... 
i 'm on it ... 
naturally . 
it 's cold out there tonight , <person> . 
all right , <person> . go tell <person> to take you . 
him ? 
you 've lost your cause 
do as i tell you ! 
then you should stay here . 
disrupt our brain waves , interfere with our ability to think . 
mossad ? 
he ai n't going out . and if i go out he 's just gon na kill the people . there 's a lot of lives that i 'm responsible for ... that 's all . so , i ca n't do anything . i got myself into this mess and i 'll get myself out of it ... the best way i know how ! <number> of the ways is not giving up . i 'm telling ya ! 
i 'm pretty nervous . are you ? 
... we were speaking of my < u > father < /u > ... 
you 're fuckin ' crazy . you 're all fuckin ' crazy ! 
about thirty <number> to <number> . 
what ? 
so , when are you getting a plastic fuck doll ? 
<person> 's around someplace ... 
why would you want to leave ? 
speed -- <number> <number> , seventy-five thousand kilometers per second . 
-- i am the sea , which covers the desert forever under its weight . 
continue . 
the men and women of detachment three-o-three , with their ... 
your honors , the state rests . 
because he could . he did it because he could . what other reason were you looking for ? 
how many times i got to tell you . i saw a ship . 
not no more . 
well , if you 're talking about contamination , you 're getting out of my area of expertise . let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at usc . 
do n't worry , honey 
it 's almost there . the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time . 
oh , fuck you ! 
and this ? 
why ? 
just relax . 
yes , you do , you damn well do . 
i hope not . 
i 'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it , but that 's a lie . some of us will always be rattling cages . 
and you fuck people up for a living . that do n't make me you . < u > capisce < /u > , shitbird ? 
in the last <number> months , <person> <person> has bought <number> acres , <person> <person> <number> acres , <person> <person> <number> acres , and <person> <person> <person> <number> acres . 
absolutely ... 
sooner -- if you like . see you again , i hope . 
so make your domestic decisions and maybe we 'll talk again . 
a flower ... 
an attempt to ruin us ! 
that is what you must discover . see what i am , my love . with all your power - see me , and know what i am . 
give him a minute , <person> . 
<person> designated pris : incept data december <number> <number> , competitive , programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers . 
hi . 
she 's my girlfriend . 
no -- that 's atmosphere . <person> layer . 
what do you mean , maniacs ? 
that 's my trick ear , <person> . it sounded as if you said no charge . 
`` and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms ... '' 
yes , <person> ... . we have visuals ... the system is supposed to be devoid of human forms ... 
ai n't that hard , son . this young farmgirl , she got tired of all that attention goin ' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em . just like 'ole <person> <person> fixed her whole family -- except young roxy here , she did n't use a wedding present . she used <person> 's razor . 
i can see why you put your faith in him . he 's a genuine ... good guy ... good at what he does . that 's rare . 
you bastard ! ! 
i trusted mitchell . it was that damn big mouth wife of his . 
i 'll come back later . i got messages at the holiday inn to collect . 
how 'd you get in here . 
my god . you even cooked up that norfolk trip .

oh . i 'd forgotten . 
do n't be funny . 
true . 
i do n't have much time . they do n't even need bugs anymore . they got these fuckin ' satellite waves . they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , subcutaneous , between his eyes . he was <number> of those products of a crossbreading experiment . a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother . you 'd never believe half the shit the agency does . i 'm so fuckin ' tired . have n't slept since that shit article came out . why 'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this ? 
yes . 
my name has n't always been <person> <person> . it was once <person> <person> . 
mine ? why -- naturally -- whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me -- owning a lot of its industry -- newspapers and other odds and ends . and if i thought you had the welfare of the state at heart , like myself -- for instance , if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way -- why , i 'd say you were a man to watch . for a fellow your age , you 'd be in a spot to make a great start in life . if you liked business -- you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top . or politics . if you like being a senator . no reason why you could n't come back to that senate for the rest of your life . 
<person> up . 
darned if i do n't ! 
i never looked down on you , fredo . you do n't look down at a brother .

you bet your life . `` the mill wheel goes around ... some times it 's even under water -- then it rises up , as high as it can go ... '' 
i 'd like to know . i 'll go along . 
i ca n't stand it . 
why would you need <number> time zones ? you never leave <person> <person> .

how long will the effect last ? 
so you had sex with him ? 
oh , i know about <person> <person> , all right . i 've done a little hitchhiking myself . ah shucks , that 's like telling <person> <person> you 're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone . i 'd heard tales about you from people i 'd meet in jail cells and truckstops . i heard about your , uh , your , ah , your wonderful thumbs , and i heard how you were <person> <person> 's girl friend ... 
ahhhhhh . <person> , <person> , <person> .

do n't listen to 'em , do n't quit . remember - <person> , <person> , and king were against the war . where are they now ? do n't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war . president <person> bombed <person> for years and nobody knew or said a thing . how the hell the times ever got ahold of this ellsberg stuff is a disgrace ! 
like i said , <person> <person> -- i 'm afraid you 're in a great deal of danger . remember what happened to <person> . 
<person> young , a california lawyer -- 
oh i do n't give a shit the guy 's a slob . he does n't even know how to spell ` lady ' let alone treat me like <number> . you know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink ? 
should i be expecting him anytime soon ? 
you never know what 's in the heart and just because you can cry does n't make you human . 
flew . told my wife i was going to a promise keepers convention . 
she 's all over him , are you blind ? 
whoa , huh huh . <person> . 
what 's extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach . eat another sesame seed and that 's it . 
well , what kind of answer are you looking for , <person> ? what is it exactly that you want to know ? 
so what book did you buy ? 
`` we went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life . '' anybody want to read ? 
why , you said ... 
payne . 
huh ... yeah , yeah ... of course . 
what does the manager say ? 
nice work . maybe if you 're real lucky , you 'll wind up in here with me . but i doubt you 'll survive that long . 
he was n't going to shoot her , you murdering son of a bitch ! 
i didn â€™ t know who or what had happened to my brother yet , mr <person> ! 
it does n't make a difference ! i have to move out ! 
fuck you .

i 'll bet . <person> â€“ `` the grand productive days . '' what a goddamn phony . 
you 're back in the pink , <person> ? how 're you keeping ? 
why do n't you see lester ? 
he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .

when ... 
well , well , small world . <person> <person> . 
i ai n't stayin ' ... i set out lookin ' for <person> ... i aim to keep on ... 
'cause you needed it . 'cause you could n't hear me without it . 
all the time you spend tryin ' to get back what 's been took from you there 's more goin ' out the door . after a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it . 
i do n't know what they 'd do to me . 
nah , listen to it . it 's a pussy . it 'll just steam on us . it wo n't flash . go high in the ceiling . 
yes -- but i did n't give it to him --

me too ... hey ... if it gets dull a little before <number> , drop by the studio . 
yes ? 
no such thing <person> - 'cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what 's going on bud ? do you know something ? remember there 're no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you 're part of something here , <person> . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs . do n't sell that out . 
i do n't mind a parasite . i object to a cut-rate one . 
some of himâ€¦ char-broiled bones . <person> . we ruled out suicide . any bad blood between him and <person> ? 
yes , it is good . what do you think is in these other drawers ? 
if he were that famous , he probably would n't give me the time of day . this way , he 's like < u > my < /u > famous person . yeah , my own personal famous person . who treats me like i 'm somebody worth talking to . 
you know . look at me like -- like i look at women . 
how do you do , <person> <person> ? 
are you going to deny it ? 
he 's kidnapping me ! ! ! 
well , thank you , that 's a very nice thing for you to say . 
you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles . you know who filled that bag for you ? not alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself . men with guts filled it , by god -- men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles -- suffering , ingratitude , loneliness , death -- 
so can we . so the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy . and we 're shippin ' 'em to <person> <person> for the criminally insane . 
this is your bachelor party . you have n't had sex with anyone yet . 
that 's right , me .

perfect dozen . 
i ca n't . 
our plane crashed . in the grand canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to l.a . they needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven . 
you his wife ? 
kalen , right now you need to go up to bed . you 're exhausting <person> . 
congratulations on the deal . how exciting . is sally doing <person> ? i mean it 's sally . the character that 's based on sally . the character that 's based on sally in the book .

yes , something 's very wrong , dr. mumford . 
nugent . <person> <person> . 
when she comes down , do n't say that i 've been here . 
excuse me . 
how do you figure ? 
what about for you ? 
i think it 's <person> . 
chile , congo , <person> , cuba . <person> 's there 's a need for an executive action capability , there 's a track <number> . in cuba , <person> <person> was the bay of pigs invasion . track <number> ... it was our idea . we felt the invasion would n't work unless we got rid of castro . so we asked ourselves -- who else wants <person> dead ? the mafia , the money people . so we put together track <number> ... 
you do the right thing . sit with me while i heal , let it develop slow . 
me ? i do n't know what you mean . 
you -- you -- 
<person> ' away . 
i made it outside . i 'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here . <person> is on the way . just sit tight .

like hell you ai n't ! 
what ? 
well , all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call <person> to play <person> <person> with some local legend about this character everybody calls dr. satan . 
what 's the bottom line ?

moonlight ! 
europe ? the europe ? this is my first time out of kansas . 
months , <person> . 
please . i do n't want to scare you . 
they 're not home yet . 
a funny story ? 
subtlety ? 
rocky ! 
insurance ? a love affair ? <person> unadulterated hatred ? believe me , the da will come up with plenty of reasons . 
oh , yeah ? 
my name 's <person> . * 
how about both of us at the same time ? 
you know how much those well child exams cost -- 
no . it 's unhealthy . 
yeah . 
i am told so . 
that 's fine . 
but she doted on the frowner 
you 're both embezzling . i saw the records . 
all right , forget about it . 
had he been trying to blackmail you ? 
sure is . 
oh my god . 
but a hundred men could move him . 
fuck dana . i 'm sick of dana . 
i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i do n't want the archdiocese exposed . 
communications systems ready . communications officer -- ready as she 'll ever be . 
no . i quit . take your lame ass ideas , your fake ass toupee , your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them . 
you made me have an abortion . 
my lisa . she went into <person> 's apartment , and he came back . the only way i could get her out was to call the police . 
this is a cobra , <person> <person> . yes , it is real . 
and are you here to berate me for making her that way ? 
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed ... 
i do n't know what that means . 
do n't shoot . 
all right . name it . 
but he was playing the game . i mean , you saw him ... 
i 'm sorry charlie ... i did n't mean it . 
now what was your news , <person> ? 
... nothing . 
we 'll use smoke pots . like the army uses . 
ah . 
how about `` <person> <person> 's slot arcade ? '' `` hot slots , '' that sounds heavy . twenty- <number> cent hotdogs ... 
i do n't have to ... 
can i put my hand inside your nightgown , <person> ? 
it was nice . 
oh . 
< u > what < /u > ! ? 
come on ! if he gives us any shit , we kill 'em all . <person> say ? just get your butt down here . if i 'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room . it 's <number> . you writin ' ? 
we can go to another movie if you like , i do n't care . i got money . there 's plenty ... 
i need your help . 
sleazy ... and demure . 
he drown ? 
i 'll see you in my dreams . 
yes . we won , that 's right . 
what is this ? 
it 's not about the money , x ! you never plan for anything . i ca n't live like that anymore , i need some stability . 
'we ? ' 
what about <person> and <person> ? is he just coaching her , or what ? 
what the hell did you do , move all the furniture ? 
his health is n't very good , you know . they take that into account . 
you might have to , if you went with me . ever try to keep warm in a c-54 , at fifteen <number> feet , at twenty below <number> ? 
-- no , no , no what is this ? who ? what 's this guy 's name ? 
unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though . 
well.. 
oh , shut up , <person> , eat your cornflakes ! 
i 'm used to lots of things , i work at wal-mart . 
hope you find him . i love that dog . 
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns . 
i 'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar ... at least you 're an interesting person ... at least you 're not exactly like everybody else ... 
and <person> told you that he 'll tell that to ... 
okay . i think you 're a darn fool , though . 
so , is n't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love ? that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it did n't stop it was going to kill him . that if she did leave his heart could n't take it . 
the transmission is an hour old ... 
me neither , but the upshot is i 've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it does n't look good . 
can i go now ? 
you have to forgive me , but in these circumstances ... with your daughter ... were there any indications of ... any sort of abuse ? 
what was that ? 
whatever . you own boardwalk , you own <person> <person> , you own the <number> railroads . you think you 're god . for all i know , you 're probably right . i just wanted to have a damn cappuccino , maybe play some nintendo after i find out what it is . man , why did n't you just < u > buy < /u > the horse ? what am i saying , you did buy it ... 
<person> as what ? what have i done ? it 's bad to want to see your own daughter ? 
what ? 
a woman ? 
buddy , sex do n't mean a thing to me . it ai n't nothin ' but a mosquito bite . i 'll tell you a secret . girls do n't want sex , <person> , girls want love . 
well , the basic ideas were frequently his- 
well , the way you were spouting , like ... . `` i do n't believe you , sir ... '' and all that . yeah , it was gear . 
you mean a nanoâ€”tech synthetic organism . 
th-th-they 'll kill <number> hostage every hour until it is -- 
she ca n't be here without me . 
listen , you dumb fuck ! the thing mutates we live underground ! the world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats . we 're like moles or worms . all we want to do is study the original ... 
does n't have to be now . let 's go taste . 
it worked before ... 
... <person> and <person> for sure ... 
listen , <person> , if you 're gon na pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again -- 
now they only have <number> rockets left . 
i want you to hit all the dealers in town . give them a list of people close to <person> and see if any of them use . then i want you to check out a doctor <person> <person> . he lives up in roseburg . 
go to the sunset sheraton . right now ! just go ! go ! 
<person> <person> <person> . he wrote about the <number> deadly sins . 
puffy , get over here . 
your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card . 
i am not left-handed . 
i got ta tell you , that guy scares me a lot more than whatever 's down there . a.j . <person> <person> goddamn jarhead robot . <person> , gim me a couple hours on this . 
micheal . tell lois that nothing ... 
well ? 
so she did n't mention anything more about it ? 
yeah . 
lois will stay with them . or we can pawn them off on your parents . 
he said if <person> 's interested , i could get a half a <number> for it easy . but do n't worry , <person> , i 'm still giving you until friday . 
stop ! i do n't want to know . <person> still . so ... it was <person> that ordered you here ? 
you 're better at it . 
but you were pulling your hips last night . 
these are dangerous times . they want the <person> <person> to lead them . 
i know , but even if they go away , everybody in america knows what we 're doing because ... they went away . 
dr. chilton ... i believe you know each other ? 
well , uh , i 'm raring to go . 
what is it ? 
it 's all right . it 's not hurting ... 
... the box can change their lives . our stock coupons will spike . 
yeah . 
that 'll be the day . 
eh ... yes ... 
oh , thanks , thanks , <person> . i always knew you guys were kind-hearted . 
yeah . well . they 're a talkative buncha commentators . 
i do n't like to be scared , <person> , i have a thing about fright , do n't ever scare me . 
that 's what i 'm saying . we were , if we were that kind of guys , to knock it off , and trash the joint , it looks like robbery , and take the fuckin ' leads out of the files ... go to <person> <person> . 
oh sweet <person> , <person> , looka this ! 
sid i can see you ! 
the phone 's out . 
each day is better than the next . have you ever been , you know ... in love with someone ? 
<person> , what is going on , for heaven 's sake ! you going to stay up all night every night ? for what ? so you 'll be the only man in america who read the entire <number> volumes of the warren report ? 
a woman ? work . 
will we never teach these austrians to be good citizens . it was his duty to give the evidence . 
poor communication skills . 
this road do n't go to globe , <person> -- where were you going to meet me ? 
it beats dr. <person> 's theory . she thinks it 's nothing but sex , drugs , and rock & roll . 
could be anything ... men in isolation ... some beef that snowballed ... got out of hand ... 
i did n't know your size . 
the american `` people '' ? 
whatcha predicting -- your boy goldwater going to split the party ? 
how long have we known each other , <person> ? 
what are you worried about ? this job is going to last a long time . 
you 'll feel better tomorrow . 
that 's a long story ... 
forever . 
pardon me , madam - but what am i to say to the newspapermen ? 
good . then have a drink . 
i can dig that . bittersweet perfection . dogs of lust on leashes of memory ... yeah . 
that is so unoriginal . you disappoint me , <person> . 
i 'm going to throw up . 
i 've got to cover a bet there on the way over . anyway , it gives us a chance to talk . 
that 's the idea -- we split them . 
i do n't know . that 's why i 'm asking you . 
-- that was the place ... and you were the guy . 
he 's got something to tell you , auggie . 
what is it ? 
he *smells* like he could put you to sleep ! 
not exactly . as i said , this is some kind of- 
nobody can help me . you , least of all . 
you ca n't work if you ca n't think . you get in bed . it 's all right . i 'll stay here with you . it 's all right . come on ... 
died there ? how ? 
simple . be friendly like us . not hostile . 
my job is not to determine his guilt or innocence . that 's up to the jury . my job is defend him . 
no , nothing , sorry . 
that is of no interest . 
will you let me talk to you , please ? 
'cause it 's nicer than my place . 
me ? 
not if i 'm the one . 
it 's huge . this musta been a grand old place at <number> time . 
and then , just before it got so bad that he had to be committed , he said that he could ... 
capability , yes . but where can warp drive take us , except away from here ... ? 
would you settle for a husband ? 
come with me . 
the computer just translated the goddamn message . it 's not an s.o.s . it was a warning . 
who ? 
well , this expert dr. egelhoffer , from new york , decides to make <person> re-enact the crime -- 
i 'm not in the mood for native american wisdom . 
i 'll but you one . what 'll you have ? 
what do you mean , next ? 
who was she ? 
look , everybody remembers your old man . being his son , all you had to do was breathe to graduate here . <person> <person> <person> <person> . but you blew us off . why should i take you back ? 
then i suppose it 'd be insurrection , and i suppose i 'd have to kill you . i suppose . 
i did n't come this far to bury a guy that 's not my dad . he owes me . 
it 'll keep the fear of god in the hitters . trust me . 
why not ? maybe she 'll help me . you wo n't . you 'd better stay here . 
his journal . he sent it to me the day before he died . everything about you is in it . the blow jobs , the hand jobs , the menages , your bout with bulimia , the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you ... eww . let 's see , then there 's your coke problem ... you still keep it in your crucifix , do n't you ? it 's all in there . 
nah , nuthin ' on my end -- 
you 're not funny . 
oh <person> , i ca n't make this decision . 
what for ? 
you 're losing your temper ! 
she did ... did n't she ? 
i know . thank her for me . 
this is dr. drossos , chief medical officer of my division . 
so you 've said . 
yes ! vibrant and modern and stark like a picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning i we shoot the whole thing in the gallant american west -- 
yes - 
you 've made a wise choice . keep up the good work . 
is it that bad ? 
you â€™ re mad ... 
is she coming back ? 
has it got any sports in it ? 
he is weak . 
we do . for unsolicited manuscripts . we pay twenty pounds a manuscript . you might get <number> , maybe <number> in a week . can you live on sixty pounds ? 
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings . 
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ? 
whatta you mean , do n't go ? whatta- whatta what 's the matter ? whatta you expecting termites ? what 's the matter ? 
good evening , commander . everything ready ? 
i wo n't . 
you said you knew where my fiance was the other night . 
it 's great . i swea -- i 'm -- i 'm , tch , i 'm speechless . i was ... i was not in the mood to listen to this thing now . i do n't know what to say . i 'm moved and i laughed and i -- uh , i , you know , i was on the edge of my seat . i just think it 's wonderful ! i 'm , i 'm totally ... stunned . this is not an insult . i 'm amazed that you can ... it was -- i just thought it was great . 
ca n't you tell ? 
so what do you wan na do ? 
i 'll give you what you need -- i have money . 
it 's just a matter of time . 
penetration but not perforation . 
bud , why are you doing this ? it 's not part of you life any more . 
how could you ? unless you were there . 
it 's just -- fabulous . think you could do anything for me ? 
i 'm in possession of the bag he was carrying . and i 'm in a position to negotiate . what about your husband and your child ? 
you wo n't go to the police if i tell you ? 
we 'll be praying for you . 
i heard that . 
yes , well , everybody in casablanca has problems . yours may work out . you 'll excuse me . 
we have to . i 've got to be in new york on thursday . 
if you like that type . 
when it broke , he said <number> word : get me <person> <person> . 
what do you mean you know ? he told you he was gon na propose to me ? 
the whole idea of <person> was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man . even the limits we put on it are human limits . it can do this , it can do that ! it designs , it creates ! 

well , why do n't you take it out of your account ? there 's a lot there . 
me neither ... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches . 
our agency monitors all threats very carefully , and there 's good reason to believe <person> <person> has the training , the connections , and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large . 
oh , sure . the boss sent me over with it . <number> <number> dollars , was n't it ? 
you girls are n't from brooklyn or anything ? 
positive . 
i must go . i 'm in a hurry . 
yeah ? 
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then ? 
can ya dig it ? 
bork , when this is all over , remind me to make you an appointment with <person> <person> . 
who is that ? where 's that coming from ? 
the machine will bring his temperature down . his vital functions are strong . 
jeez , that thing ... ca n't you ... 
yeah yeah i know . smoking kills . i 'll quit someday . does n't it seem like all the cool people smoke ? 
yes , i noticed he was getting a little fat lately . ouch ! 
i had so many things to think about ! 
that we fired <number> photon torpedoes . but - 
i 'll have to know a little more than that . 
could you wait a little while . this key may not fit . 
very well . 
have now . 
listen -- i took a steak out of the freezer . i thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party -- just the <number> of us , what do you say ? 
you still know . 
that you put a murderer on my trail ? 
what are you talking about ? 
that 's ridiculous . 
any other entrance ? 
not at first , but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put <number> and <number> together . 
i went to a few just to meet women . but i do n't like to dance , and it 's so fuckin ; loud . during that whole scene i just drank in bars . who did n't make the cut ? 
it 's all rather morbid though is n't it ? 
damnit , i just hadda bust out ! my wife wrote me she was gettin ' married ! i got ta stop it ! 
<number> years , huh ? 
i , uh , do n't really know any . we - - 
what an adorable hat . 
i 'd like to ask you about the claymore . 
that has nothing to do with it . we 've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it 's better for the students -- that 's all there is to it . 
mom , when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning ? 
you do n't get it , do you ? 
<person> <person> , are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us ? have n't you any decency left ? 
this is n't about me anymore . 
you suckers have n't had a good day since the alamo . 
it 's my response to the issue of a woman 's right to choose ... it 's something i feel super-strongly about . 
i have a sore throat . 
what have you done ? 
i must have left my appetite outside , which is where i think we ought to be right now . 
yes i did . did you hear my answer ? 
well , i 'm running out of trees , so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you do n't know ! convince me ! 
any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me ... disagreeable . just ask your husband . 
gee , this is great . 
she 's right . 
but -- what 's this ? i thought you were going along with me . 
you 'll have to make up your own mind about that . 
who 's up for making some real money ? 
no self confidence , i guess ... at least you do n't take after him . 
what do you know about boats ? i bet you ca n't even swim . 
<person> was borned a little too early on . my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other . i reckon they changed their mind about havin ' another'n . i was about <number> or <number> year old then and they did n't care too much for me so i reckon they did n't need somethin ' else to worry 'em with . 
inez , this is -- 
waddaya read there , <person> ? 
<person> data , set a pursuit course . <person> warp . 
... and now ? 
what about the tape ? 
immediately . is this the daily news ? <person> <person> . would you get me the city desk , please ? 
so then <person> walks straight into the creative director 's office and says `` the code 's fine , the program 's for shit '' and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk ! 
what happened ? 
get a grip . reed . we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ... 
i 'm sorry , <person> . i ca n't talk now . i 'll call you tonight ... i 'm sorry . i 'm coming , <person> . 
difficult , sir . this is , as you pointed out , a civil war . 
precautionary , <person> <person> . <person> up ... 
yes . 
suzie -- 
your dreams ? 
yes . 
will you relax , please ? they 're gon na love you , i know . 
no . he gets shot by the old lady . 
as i said , a worshipper of snakes , and of smoke , and flames . 
well , yes , i know , dear , but these people are in such need and we have plenty now . 
you loved back ? 
you 're saying the bombing was a cover-up . of what ? 
good day ! 
what ? 
huh ... i do n't know . they got <person> <person> 's there . i do n't know why the fuck i 'm going there for . 
what are you trying to say to me , fish ? 
dee ? what are you doing here ? 
admiral , i asked you a question . 
smith , use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster . 
she will , <person> <person> , she will ... 
move away , cupcake . he 's got a gun . 
gwen . 
what do you mean to do ? 
you ca n't go out lecturing ? tough shit . women are dying . where can i lay this stuff out ? 
elena , what are you 're talking about ? 
do n't worry -- i 'll use the old nixon charm on her . 
who ? the other woman . your wife . 
[ beat ] i know it does n't make sense . it does n't even make sense to me . 
no you ca n't . 
how you know that ? shit , it was runnin ' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart ... 
the hospital ... ? 
she 's in icu . 
what about tonight ? 
be smart about it . 
those are < u > my < /u > children you 're practicing on . they deserve < u > first- < /u > rate care . every minute . of every night . and every day . 
and you crazy ? he thinks shows like this are dumb . if you did n't have an <number> number i could never get away with this -- 
it 's the busy season . 
i guess so , <person> , because that 's not all . tell them what else we 've got , <person> . 
but why ? we raised you as a jew . 
he 's running a fever . 
uh , it 's a slogan . from , uh ... 
<person> said we could . if we helped out with the posters and stuff . and we did . and we are . 
no crickets or cicadas calling . no bird songs . 
i 've had enough of this , i 'm leaving . 
over here , inside the smokehouse . 
no ! because i -- 
why ? 
sounds like you speaks from experience . 
what 's with you ? what do you care whether i come or not ? 
<number> cents , please . 
you must have some feeling . some immediate impression . a young , attractive woman , involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will . and the things that went on in that house . such wild sex . what kind of picture does that paint ? 
some people i know , they 're planning to rob the golden lion . 
how do you know it was <person> ? 
he 's having a problem here . 
what do they expect you to say ? 
and i 'm not even pretty . 
yes . 
yeah i know . so what do we do ? 
what ? 
yes . 
that 's fine . 
i 'm not going anywhere . 
sure . just papers , photos . <person> nobody 'd ever want . 
speck . <person> <person> . 
`` the former executive has reason to bet on being sued , for major cigarette manufacturers ... '' 
name ? 
should ? 
you ca n't get away with.. 
-- i 've got the tapes . if you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what i say . bring <number> <number> euros to your boat at <number> o'clock . 
d.a.m.o.u.r . d'amour . <person> d'amour . 
oh , for god 's sake , <person> -- we have no reason to doubt the man ! are we listening to lionel now ? 
uh-uh . i 'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though . 
unless i 'm not who i think i am . 
well , it ruins it for me if you have grass because , you know , i 'm , like , a comedian- 
him . 
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability , depression , anxiety , periods of self-reproach . it 's almost like schizophrenia . different sides of your personality might come to life , speak out , act out . 
should n't you lie down ? 
full disruptors . 
i guess i owe you my life . 
we stuck his head in the latrine , after ten of us had used it . 
but i still do n't think ... 
pass . 
francis . you gon na leave the seeds in there ? in the binding like that ? 
you gave your word ? 
i know , man . 
why not ? 
fuck you . 
is that what you did ? 
yeah . a <number> . right ... how are you ? 
i do n't think it knows it 's torturing us . it 's just watching . 
i will prove it to you . come swim with me now , <person> . now -- tonight . 
yeah . <number> of the corniest lines i ever heard . 
listen to what you 're saying , mom . is there any evidence she is ? 
we seem to 've come across a <number> , sir . 
it 's not necessary . 
well , come to think of it , we did have a big event around here . <person> started talking . 
there 's a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred-and- first near ramelle . i want you to take a squad up there . if he 's alive , bring him back to the beach for debarkation . take whoever you need , you 've got your pick of the company . 
half-five . at <person> 's . 
me neither . <person> barely even fits . the thing is , i try to remember why we did it , and i ca n't . helping people , or righting wrongs , or trying to save the world . . . i do n't know . it all seems so abstract . 
you got time on your side . pretty soon they 'll be missed and we 'll have the law up our ass . 
now ask him who his mother was . 
you do n't mean ? 
he thought , perhaps , <person> <person> might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government . 
i want to -- what else can i do with my money ? you may not see me again -- for a while . 
do you ? 
you 're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady . 
you can tell me how someone ... could fake a prevision . 
told ya i would . you still riled ? 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . what 's happened ? 
right . 
`` justice '' ? if that 's `` justice '' ... , then the sooner french guns blow the english army out of america , the better it will be for these people . 
i 'm not positive this means anything . 
or i could go for a swim ... although , i got ta tell you ... if i never get in the water again ... 
you ai n't dead . 
you do n't have to apologize for me ! i 'm sorry if i hurt your feelings . it 's just my way of talkin ' ... 
let 's hope ... so far , somebody 's tried to sabotage this mission twice . 
okay , then . <person> candied <person> . 
good luck ! 
thanks for the sound advice . now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here . alone . 
i think we should do something with strong female characters ... 
yeah , i guess it is , boy . just you and me . 
boy , if that 's what you think , i must 've really screwed up my job as a father . 
you heard the order , lieutenant . 
yeah . with potential . 
not exactly ... 
who buys them ? tax collectors ? 
i know what you did . 
long time , is right . i do n't remember them days too horrorshow . do n't call me dim no more , either . officer , call me . 
are you sure ? 
good , what 's his number ? 
right . like last night 's doozie . 
did n't want your father to die either , did ya ? but it happened . 
a telegram from moscow ! it must have been here all day ! 
oh , she said that , did she ? what else did <person> <person> have to say ? 
for what ? we ai n't gon na have no house after the auction tomorrow ! 
no , no . i 'm full . too much fin and hump , you know , gives me gas . Å“scuse me . 
the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man . <person> wo n't talk to women . 
shall we have another ? 
so ? 
i wonder ... what ... was it all ... for ... 
`` what we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity ... and take it . and that 's it . '' and we sit there . i got the pen out ... 
what do you want to know about <person> <person> ? 
mimi ... 
you want to smuggle narcotics in <person> <person> <person> . that 's nothing new . 
you 'll find i 'm full of surprises . 
go onâ€” a little present from your uncle <person> . and <person> , tomorra mornin ' when you shape the men put <person> in the loft . number <number> . every day . nice easy work . check in and goof off on the coffee bags . o.k . ?

the world is what you make of it , friend . if it does n't fit , you make alterations . 
how you doing ? i thought you guys all wore those penguin coats . 
the whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall ? she wanted you arrested for harassment . i told her to chill out and smoke a joint . i 'd look the other way as long as she did you know ? 
magda ? she 's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she does n't like to be alone .

the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated . in <number> night i recorded cold spots , shifting magnetic fields , the e.u.p . is picking up white sounds everywhere . 
you would n't know news if you fell into a mess of it , nose first . so you 're the bright lad that 's never been scooped ! 
yes . well . my pleasure . 
should i be ? 
independent . <person> shit , just independent . they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book ... big . <person> . <person> .

it 's mine to risk . 
where . up <person> 's ocarina . did n't you know ? 
the numbers do n't make sense , sir . his brothers are dead , that 's too bad , but they 're out of the equation . sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from <number> thousand miles away . <number> private is simply not worth a squad . <person> anderson this <number> is . he 's worth a lot more than that . <person> is why i 'm sending you , you 're the best field officer there is . 
anything you say , mammacitta . 
classy . 
no !

he must 've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa . in the shower ! left bloody footprints all over the ... 
hmmm . 
i am mad at you ! and at landon ! and the universe ! and god ! i do n't even know where to put all my anger . 
but morals come from the heart , not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart <person> has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore , she 's not immoral . not really . 
not *me* ! <person> <person> is the man they ought to be listening to ! come on ! 
how could that be ? people do n't live for <number> <number> years . 
the other guy . 
right now , as we sit here , he is tearing through your apartment . he is digging through your drawers , emptying your closets . he will take your telephone and address books , your appointment books . if you keep a diary , he is reading it . he 'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat , liquor you drink , cigarettes you smoke . in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled . if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them . 
i 'm sorry , i do n't keep any liquor in the house . 
i 'll be sending you on a report tonight . 
then you know him ? 
my greatness is better demonstrated with this . 
sweeney tells me you do n't have computer confirmation ? 
again . <person> , man . 
yeah , sure . 
if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way ... 
that 's right . it 's a combined data stream based on all <number> previsions . 
yeah . 'cause , you know , he 's never gon na give me my jewelry . 
it was n't that serious ... 
do n't panic . i might be wrong . <person> ? i guess i was wrong . 
do n't pity me . pity the polish lancer . after all , i 'm alive . 
uh-huh . 
she 's very nice , apparently . lives in norfolk . and very left-wing . you 'll have to watch yourself there . 
get off an all-bands emergency distress , and put it on a repeater . 
exactly . you 're changing . you 're becoming something extraordinarily powerful . 
he 's got the most beautiful eyes ... the hell kind of question is that ? he 's a guy . 
there 's no rule ! 
this is another victory , my friends . what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress . 
we 'll have to make them come to us , wo n't we ? and since there are <number> of them , we 're going to set <number> plans in motion . first : we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night . 
yeah ? see ya . 
not at all . 
i 'm only on tv because i got ta be able to hang around the casino . you understand that . you know that . come on . 
why does he trust you ? 
so where you go off to , <person> ? some expedition in new guinea or <person> <person> ? 
that 's good . so then what do you do now ? 
i know . 
yes . 
right . 
that 's not quite what i had in mind . 
all right , so that 's what we 've got . a week . it 's plenty of time . 
i want to stop getting involved with men who are n't good for me . 
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out ... 
give me that ! ! 
had it with deals . 
if we do n't , he 'll die . 
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief . 
i 'll get some . 
let me check the zip - <number> fuck you ? 
lem me get this straight , you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ? 
<person> < u > what < /u > home ? ... the leavin 's of comanche bucks -- sold time an ' again to the highest bidder ? ... with savage brats of her own , most like ? ...

how will that be done , exactly ? 
totally . i checked all the rooms and closets ... 
we did n't talk about this . they took the little boy , <person> . 
i do n't have any money . 
chose another . any general worth anything should have a brace of horses . 
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you . 
you treated me like shit . 
should i call you later ? 
been putting my files into it . you take sugar and milk ? 
i think she 's disappointed that i 'm not more , ah , sort of atavistic . she 's got some naive , sentimental notions about indians . i 'm sure she liked me , though ; but ... . then she left town . 
you 're putting me on the spot , <person> . 
aaah ... stop picking on me ... you 're as bad as the rest of them . 
that was a compliment . 
who are you calling a fucking ass- hole ? it 's this bastard bed that 's your fucking problem ! 
oh , and by the way , i think it 's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder . 
and your jewelry too . i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss . 
storms ! floods ! 
<number> of my few virtues is discretion . 
taken . 
i do n't know . 
all i 'm saying ... you do n't know how high up the food chain this thing goes . i 've heard stuff . 
and he agreed ? 
that might work . 
it is too late . he has drunk . 
i do n't care .

yes . 
jesus . i do n't even wan na ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk . 
yeah ... bedtime . 
too big ? 
for an hour . 
you 've been fucking somebody else have n't you ? 
on the contrary -- this is tremendous . i mean , we 're all frightened to death of disapproval and we 're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and i 'm not saying we should , you know , < u > declare < /u > ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty -- 
uh no . i think i 'm gon na get out while i 'm ahead . 
no , it 's humiliating and you 've been doing it since i was a kid . i do n't like it . stop . you may not like having a daughter with problems . but guess what ? i do n't like having a father who 's drunk all the time . i 'll eat in my room . 
i wrote it down in your calendar , then left a message at your house -- 
well , <person> , if i 'd known you were going to get so humpty about it , i would n't have bothered . are you going to eat that ? 
no . if anything happened , you 'd be stuck in there like he was . 
you think ? 
at ease . <person> <person> , you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible . yet i find you in a poker game . 
it is . i 'll get this . you go ahead . 
hope you do n't mind , captain , might help us catch these guys that much sooner . coming ?

what he did was light the bandwagon on fire . because he knows what i know -- that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way . 
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be <person> <person> and became <person> <person> . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view . 
look -- we 're under a lot of pressure , we 're tired , you 're not thinking straight . 
i keep telling you , they < u > can < /u > come on land , i do n't wan na wake up in the middle of the night -- 
it 's all i could safely move . 
give me that ! 
brill 's dead . he died of small pox when he was <number> and he was buried in a kansas field . my name does n't matter . 
suits me < u > fine < /u > ! 
to bring you ... your birthright . 
you use your sleeve . 
who ? 
i didn â€™ t mean to imply you did , <person> <person> . 
no you must n't , my child . 
it wo n't be long , gentlemen . 
do n't you miss it ? 
all right -- i 'll go out and find <number> . 
what about <person> ? 
hey , no problem , it 's probably just another kidnapping featuring <person> 's shrink , pardon me , make that ex-shrink . this is your leader , a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for god knows what whacko irresponsible schemes , and now who knows what she 's painted out there on our wall ? 
i ai n't goin ' to jail , and i ai n't doin ' that probation thing again . 
rogue ? 
what do we have to know , <person> ? we 're all together , we all love each other , we all need each other . what else is there ? mother , i want us to stay alive ! 
you better . 
buddy . well , now , that 's a nice name , i like it . i am real pleased to meet you . hey , look , do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere ? 
margo in the cub room . i could n't be more surprised if she 'd said <person> 's tomb . 
you speak french . 
we 're trying to repair <person> <person> 's ship . it 's been damaged and -- 
you could see all the things he did , could n't you ? 
you need to know a lot of shit , <person> . 
sure . i even thought about you when i woke up . 
i care ! and i care because god cares ! all life is precious to god -- even his -- even yours and mine ... 
yes , everything is getting worse . but everything is also getting better . 
we ? you 've taken it ? 
louise , let me call you back after i wire it , so you 'll know which office to go to . 
it did n't come up . 
not me . 
hi . 
jeebs is eager to have me deport him . but would rather kill himself than go downtown . why ? 
no . 
well , not exactly . see , i met this girl . real nice girl . god-fearing girl . her name 's sylvia . 
what is your nationality ? 
at the very least , this man has the right to know whether there 's a charge against him . 
why , there 's nothing on the news ? 
what 's your eta ? 
i do n't know . <person> <person> says the un has <number> hundred soldiers for the whole country . black soldiers , pakistanis . 
of course you do . if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people ... you â€™ d be sitting where i am now . at least i hope you would . 
why is that ? 
oh ... well that 's okay . <person> . 
<person> . my hands are tied . 
i tricked you into meeting some people you 'd think were great . i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way . 
can i trade in my car and take another ? 
that ! ... using <person> van like that ! he did no harm to anyone . <person> just wrote music . 
i see my date is here . and i think mr . <person> is ready to leave . 
but all these people ... 
they ruined me tonight . 
compass . 
<person> la la la that ai n't no crime - that ai n't no crime . 
the number 's < u > seventy-five < /u > . and it 's applications < u > and < /u > patents . 
for christ sakes . spare me the speech . i 've listened to it for a decade . the fact is that <person> <person> was a federal patient , and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law . 
what about it ? you work hard . i 'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . and where 'd it get you ? ... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . and he dropped dead at <number> with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory ... wake up pal , if you 're not inside you 're outside . and i 'm not talking a $ <number> a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , i 'm talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , 50-100 <number> , a player bud -- or nothing . you had what it takes to let through my door . next question : you got what it takes to stay ... ? ? 
and they were <number> of them . look -- 
this badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk . it is not a thing you can give up as of no value . it may be taken from you -- and you may die defending it . but you 'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with . it 's a naked steel of the sword of justice . put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it -- and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now . 
i 'm trying to bust the tijuana cartel .

you 'd lose . you 'd die . all over the sidewalk . and into the street .

what was that ? 
harold ... can i get you anything ?

in vino veritas .

yeah . would n't be no picnic for you . i ai n't exactly housebroken . 
i did n't lose it . <person> stole it . he found out that <person> switched sides , -so he turned him into somebody else . me . 
i 'm only <number> years old .

why ? 
oh , right ... 
let 's work on it .

that is n't it . it 's ... the loneliness , <person> <person> ... the loneliness ! 
and the new label ? and the kinky wizards ? 
you talking piffle , son ? 
the guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop . 
they are not . 
get it in half an hour . 
he told me about you . that he had no other friend like you . 
there was no other choice . 
and may i go to mass ? 
they think it might happen all at once . 
look at the treads on those . 
up to ? 
so we need <number> people , <number> women . 
not an option . 
if you 're going to drink it in here , i 'd appreciate it if you 'd not bother the customers . 
i mean the performance . except for you , you 'd think he 'd never even directed it - it 's disgraceful the way they change everything around ... 
<person> cam 's still coming back tomorrow , right ? 
uh-huh . 
<person> <person> <person> laloosh -- do n't think too much . 
`` home cooking '' ... what did you call it , you said it ... it was a tag phrase that you had , , , 
i do n't know what to say . 
maybe not for you , sheriff , but i think i 've had my fill of your little town . 
micheal , by accident . 
<person> 's better than dr. no . both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office , in which field , of course , <person> was a notable success . 
perhaps she will not kill me , for i know her name . 
what else could it mean to me ? it 's obviously a lot of bunk . 
the law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel ... 
i would n't know . just do it somewhere else . there is such a thing as good manners . 
... and then , he 'll be coming down . 
on what ? 
a television set ? 
what kind of a question is that ? of course : i am . i do whatever i want . all the time . 
i 'm fine . i 'm fine . well , i 'm a little stressed . and i 've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby . 
yeah . so how do i get to venice ? 
so why did you idiots bring me here ? ... i 'm in the middle of making a picture . 
a well-rounded life . i respect that . but it has to have a center , <person> , something you care about , something you can think about . 
<number> me , i 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it . 
it was may , <number> , near gibsland , <person> . 
it was okay . 
they ca n't erase memories . it 's a joke . it 's a nasty clementine hoax . 
it 's a hundred leagues from here . 
because i 'm done . 
music . 
because when i scheduled it i did n't realize it was a holiday . you were there , why did n't you say something ? 
okay . 
<person> <person> is already a judge , my dear <person> <person> . 
i 'm okay . i 'm okay . 
you 're not listening , mother . 
yeah . i sure know that . yeah , but how many more are out there ? 
y- s-sure it did . 
<person> <person> , the union boss who got shot . somebody murdered him . 
so what ? we just stay clear of him . 
say what you got ta say , but i ai n't gon na hear you speak his name to me . not never . you hear ?

i remember thinking you were the <number> part of my life <person> did n't have a piece of -- 
get down to <person> <person> . <person> <person> look . 
yeah , i know . more careful . 
ah . neither snow nor sleet , nor dark of night ... i always admired that . 
shift to your left . 
the tv did n't work . 
did you ever ... do you have feelings for <person> ? 
because we are an odd couple . 
she hears what she wants to hear , okay ? 
you know ? and it used to scare me so much that i did n't know what was coming in my life . 
red ... <person> ? 
because ... i have to be alone ! 
a bullshit president ! i do n't see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs . where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by <person> 's communist buddies - all these damned peace treaties ! i 'm telling ya <person> , that 's what happens when you let the niggers vote . they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart . 
neither can i . what do you think they 're doing now ? 
has done what ? 
yes , sir . 
maybe . 
no . 
transpo ? how they bringing the loads in ... ? 
proceed . 
oh , <person> -- <person> -- sshh -- quiet . 
call it a guess ... 
where the hell is his body ? 
listen , <person> <person> , the suit , maybe , even though silver went out in the <number> 's . but those boots are unforgivable . what is it with men ? 
it does hurt ! and do n't you do it again . 
... good ... 
i bet . that was our rent ! 
so you do n't -- i mean i do n't like to seem like i 'm prying but i guess you do n't sleep together or anything . 
why ... ? 
will you guys relax ? we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - professional paranormal investigations and eliminations . the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams . 
agnes ... 
this is better than sex any day . this is romance ! 
i also want you to protect my brother- in-law . 
please , hold still , <person> <person> . 
okay , that 's cool , okay . but the nice time we just had ... was it nicer , as nice , or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago ? 
absolutely . 
he could be working her to get to you . 
what 's the rush ? 
why ? 
oh no ! uuh . 
yes , please . 
you raised me , like a son . 
that right ? why 's that ? 
he 's not the murderer . but he 's a bozo . 
my pleasure . 
and how 's <person> ? she 's a great girl . 
maryjane . you think that logic and police procedure , order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night . i did once . but you know how he 'll get caught ? he 'll have an accident , or some cop will get lucky . you ca n't catch him by being intelligent and working hard . or the worst : there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way , month after month . the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows , and hurry home before dark . and then , <number> day , there are no more . what happened ? did he just stop ? <person> tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more ? did he kill himself ? did he die in an auto accident ? or a fight . or get sick and die ? it 's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth . and you never know . but you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back ? 
i do n't got no daddy , you dig ? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass . 
what the fuck you telling me , <person> ? i never seen the guy get shot , i told you that . 
track the demon to his lair . 
you 're looking at him . we provide the plane , transportation cost , u.s. landing spot , and take it to wherever you want it to go . you provide the pick up point in south america , and are responsible for payment . you assume all the bust risks . we take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees , ten percent of the gross , plus our expenses . this is not a negotiation , so if this is okay with you , we can talk further . if not , we can forget we had this conversation . 
no . not exactly . it did n't exactly cool . <person> is a knock-out . and very sexy -- but -- there 's a lot of it out there . 
oh , yeah ... yeah ... it 's a hellhole . 
then how did he -- 
imagine how i feel . 
next saturday ? 
i do n't know . i just thought i might want to call you . i do n't know . 
we coulda had 'em for free , all we had to do was give 'em your sister . 
i 'll make it up to you this summer . i promise . 
what ? 
you ca n't expect me to explain that to you . 
pretty scary , huh ? 
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed wolf 's head on a spear as their symbol ? 
thanks for taking <person> . 
call him . 
count 'em on <number> hand . 
but how ? 
leave me alone . 
you kidding ? we must 've killed <number> pots in there . <person> , i got ta get home . rest the pipes . 
what do you do , just have someone follow him around with a defribilator ? 
my doctor told me that i got to move out west ... that 's when we filed in court . we did n't want to sue ... 
you 're wound too tight , <person> . let it go . 
no , really , <person> , i do n't think you -- 
<person> <person> ? 
thank you . please sit . 
are you trying to insult me ? 
at anything . at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life . at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance . if you ca n't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me . 
and all i 'm asking for is the truth . that would take <number> minutes . for all i know , you caused the explosions at the silo ... and now you 're trying to steal <person> 's ship . 
good bye , my love , a <number> times good bye . 
`` each day is a little life . every waking and rising a little birth , every fresh morning a little youth , every going to rest and sleep a little death . '' 
you 're just afraid to use this . you have technophobia , <person> . that 's what you got . 
<person> <number> . 
ca n't be good news coming from you . 
nothing . it was n't anything . i 've been on edge lately . maybe since the accident . and i 'd prefer , i really would , to just -- 
my client has ruled that out . 
i did n't sell the boy any ... 
yeah . 
ow . 
we 've got to get <person> . 
we 're going to the men 's room . only we might not make it in time . 
well , all those guys in the bleachers thinkâ€” 
which convent was that , <person> ? 
i 'll try to keep the door open . if you wash out , i make it so that -- 
then listen closely , because i 'll only say this once and if it gets repeated , i 'll deny it . i run call girls . <person> <person> is <number> of them and so was <person> <person> . i treat my girls very well . i have grown daughters , myself , and i do n't like the thought of women being hurt . i sense you share this feeling . 
let 's find them all . 
oh , no , sir . 
no , he did n't do that . 
that 's not the point . <number> rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out -- 
two-hundred . 
you wo n't get another chance at this , admiral . 
welcome to manhood , you little sparrowfart ! load that gun !

you oughta say you 're sorry -- that 's what you oughta do . 
cynthia , who knows where that tape may end up ? he could be ... bouncing it off some satellite or something . some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it . 
i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat . 
what ? 
... twenty-five <number> ? 
you 'll meet new friends . i know ... it 's rough . but i have to move , son . 
actually . if you knew the exact route , you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over . 
i thought you wanted an `` uncomplicated '' boy ? 
you have ? 
do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots ? 
i do , man . that 's a beautiful place . when i get out of here i 'm going there . find a nice little snow covered chalet , warm little woman , crackling fire -- 
naughty , naughty , naughty , you filthy old soomaka . 
i 'm not going back there . i do n't even know who you 're talking about . 
that 's it . you get it quick . 
oh ? there 's proof now ? 
of course , don â€™ t be silly . 
then where did you get this not my tape . 
yes . i flooded my school ... and i burned down that pervert 's house . i think i only have a few days left ... before they catch me . 

now take it . go on . <person> , where can i reach you ? cause i 'm gon na make this right with you soon 's i get me set up ... 
<person> troy almost strangled me to death . where the hell were you ? 
you give your word , i give mine -- that we 'll do what we say . it 's a truth exchanged between <number> people . 
but how could he know ... unless ...

no . 
<person> hospital .

he takes himself seriously . 
that kind of talk is between us . do n't you go in there with that shit on your tongue . 
i do n't take orders at all . 
oh , it 's all right . 
i can not leave these people . i will wait for the twins .

i 'm going to go ahead and go now . 
yes it is , <person> ! yes it is ! they were right there for you . she was right there for you ! look at her ! 
what about tipping off <person> ? 
death is ... everything for me . now you have to go to your cell , and i to dicker with <person> ... you 'll be fed well . i want you to be fit as you can be ; i want you to win for me tomorrow ! i want all my gladiators to win and be happy ! besides , i 've never owned a roman general before . 
well , i do n't want to walk . 
what do you mean -- through ? 
you 'll never know 'til you walk through that door ! 
they 're dying . 
agatha , you 're never going back there . 
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week .

it was pale ... a shadowed gold . 
wake up , we 're in trouble . 
beam him out ! 
you can be lookout ! ... .. <person> <person> 's gun . 
she 's a very ... determined woman . <person> to control . <person> <person> ... let her in . 
there 's a slight difference . 
you always been this selfish ? 
how do you say `` you 're dreaming '' in italian ? 
early . still dark . 
it does n't protect your head , though . 
no , it 's that when do you have time to be parents to him ? you guys do n't pick him up until <number> , ten at night . you are into yourselves , as the saying goes . spend some time trying to be parents . take him to the mountains , fishing . you ought to let him get to know nature . 
it is a terrible shock . 
if i marry you my mother will die . 
you go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick . 
i see a car . 
monday . 
i can cry on cue . 
my first squadron in vietnam , we lost <number> out of eighteen planes . <number> guys . the first <number> kills you , but there 'll be others -- you can count on it . 
are you the high lama ? 
you 'd like me better that way , <person> ? 
i - ran away ... 
no . i should go . 
fallout shelter . there 's a difference . 
to oz ? 
i just want to know where he is . 
fine . 
all right , all right ! hope you figure this out , folks . 
king of the housecalls ! master of the living room ! 
i got nowhere to go . we have n't had a good sit-down for a long while . 
not yet - though not soon enough for some people , i 've already found . a death in the doctor 's family makes the patients doubly uneasy . 
your dried cum . 
not yet . but if those guys catch us , there 'll be blood all over . <person> <person> . 
we 're going to have jackets , are n't we ? 
ben . 
we 're preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking . 
yeah . a real tragedy . 
i did n't do it . 
well , let me in . 
you would n't happen to remember if <person> <person> bought <number> , would you ? 
<number> men were ambushed and shot , <number> died and had their bodies tossed into the lake , the other has severe hypothermia , possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week 's end ... if he even lives that long . 
indeed you did . and now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him . 
maybe whatever they are , they just have n't appeared yet on her ? 
i 'd say the opposite - hypertension . 
-- stop it . he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe . 
what with the psychosis and all , yeah . 
well , what the hell , i got nothing better to do . 
i . . . ca n't . . . argue . . . 
do n't ... do n't muck me about . you 've had plenty of time to fix him up , and he 's leaving with me , now . do you understand me ? now , <person> <person> . we had a bargain ! 
right . 
do n't go to any trouble . we believe you ... we believe you . 
intriguing . i wish i had more time to discuss this matter . 
that 's all i know . you want anything more , you ask somebody else . 
hitch-hiking . 
that 's right . 
so , what-you 're stuck here all day ? 
you bet . 
you 'll see before long . let 's go . 
they wo n't allow that . it 's <number> at a time . and you have to be first . 
so did i . now pack up a few basics and -- 
i also thought he could be turned back to the good side . it could n't be done . he is more machine now than man . twisted and evil . 
open up . i want to see . 
god , <person> , you 're so unformed you 're practically fetal . you 're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends . 
... why have they stuck you on this silly little roust ? 
what 's in connecticut ? 
hell , no ! 
not funny , ha , ha , funny queer . 
there 's no such thing . 
i ... 
what am i gon na do ? put a record player out there ? bad , frankie . bad . 
<number> , i think .

no . he knows it wo n't . it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him does n't yet . 
oh , brother . 
doing what ? cleaning toilets ? 
i do n't know , dad . but it was big . 
we have to talk . whether to kill yourself is <number> of the most important decisions a teenager has to make . 
sally there 's a whole world out there . we can have a new home . a real home , not some tin-plated dump . what are you giving up ? 
you got the money ? 
what ? 
why would n't you eat a fish eye , <person> ? 
i 'm not a witch , you 're all crazy ! 
a hundred grams . 
if you were eating <person> <person> <person> and drinking coca-cola again . 
in this case , getting married means nothing . are n't we already the same as being married ? and corrado and giulia -- are n't they already the same as being married ? 
no , sir ! 
i 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead <number> ? 
not so perfectly if you noticed . 
it 's not the size of the role , <person> . am i or am i not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set ? 
really ? 
we will . 
i do n't know . 
good evening . 
`` i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows '' -- 
what do you want for free ? 
who was just here ? 
perhaps not . but i did come here and i found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me . once started , it seemed such an easy way to do good . i should have known there was no easy way to do good , betsy . 
far be it for me to dispute my first officer . <person> has always - 
yeah . so why you look do down ? 
snickers , make the list happen . oh and it 's <number> thing to play hide and seek with the mayflower 's pathetic staff , but we 're sore losers . i 've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty . 
but you 've created a virus that 's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster , just to arrest some hacker kid ? 
well . once he said he 'd read what this man wrote about me . 
the prison , man . there was this german cat an architect in the hospital . he was helping the turks build some shit round the place . i laid some bread on him and he let me copy them . 
chill ? since when do you say ch ... 
not tonight . <person> . 
yes . 
oh -- there 's no real thing -- it does n't exist . 
you 're very frank , clarice . i think - it would be quite something to know you in private life . 
please let me go . 
well , then i guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different . 
let it ride for a while . 
what he didnÃ­t get in prague . the noc list . 
i 'm not hungry . 
i saved you from the lorry and you 're not very special .

all them people shoutin ' your name like they were doing tonight ! shit ! that arm you got 'll get'chu on a box of cereal ... 
i -- i ca n't . 
it 's all right . 
that would have kept you out of the magic circle . <person> was presumably the idea . these are about <person> . 
it means they hate his freaking guts . it means if he were on fire they would n't put him out . 
neither do i , i guess . 
why do n't i have <person> thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing ? 
that 's too bad . 
oh no ! my wife took it out in time . 
laurie ! good to see you . 
may as well go out under my own free will , right ?

yes , ma . 
i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy . 
in europe women find older men very sexy . 
i hesitated taking that much . 
but i 'm a robber and a manslaughterer and i have n't had any parental guidance .

i did n't say shit . 
mulder -- what are you doing ? 
no , sir . 
i do n't know , some people just do n't like nuns . i wish i had a ruler .

i 'm wondering about the weather department . i 'm wonderin ' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments ? 
then what would be enough ? if we were married ? 
it 's hairy , though . that 's where we lost mcdonnel -- they shot the hell out of us . it 's <person> 's point .

probably did n't have time . 
<person> sinclair . <person> na know her real name ? <person> <person> . no one 's who they really are , <person> . everyone 's someone else . even you . even me . especially me . i 'm <person> <person> , the communist who 's not really a communist .

what if he 's on the level ? 
he 's not getting a phone , he does n't like talking on the phone . 
that 's okay , he can remain in hypersleep until they 're ready to treat him .

yeah , let 's talk about that . you seem to be rather an expert . i do n't remember in the last <number> months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties . 
my journals ! where are they ? 
why ? 
i do n't like horror movies ! 
no . i do n't believe in that sort of thing . but if dr. weir is right , this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe , of reality . who knows where this ship has been ... what it 's seen ... and what it 's brought back with it . 
i 'm coming right over . i 'll be right there . 
i sure hope you have n't done anything dumb <person> . 
pension him off . 
i 'm good enough for you but i 'm too slimy to associate with your daughter . that 's it , is n't it ? is n't it ? 
i 'm married to my wife ... of several years ... and i 'd like to buy ... as a christmas present ... 
all right . have a nice christmas . 
<number> . what happened back then ? 
this is forgery . it is very clever . 
it 's cool ! 
of course you do . a tuxedo and tails . 
fuck you , kid . 
well , me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and , like , they do n't speak english right , and so my buddy gets into a fight , and he goes 'hey , quit hassling me cause i do n't speak french or whatever ' , and the other guy goes something in paris talk , and i go 'um , just back off ' and he goes 'get out ' and i go 'make me ' . 
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep . 
how 'd you know ? 
he was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago . his name is bein ' borrowed these days by the long lost <person> <person> . 
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but do n't think we 're friends . i 'm sorry , but i have other things - 
she told me i have to . 
loretta , i ca n't marry you . 
i know who he is ... 
do n't know , delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin ' for their lack of sight , even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers . now clearly , seein ' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery . it 's not so surprising , then , if an organism deprived of earthly vision- 
no life signs at all . he 's a turnip . 
interesting . 
has anybody talked to them ? 
you know ? how do you know ? 
what are you doing ? 
oh , darn it . 
so there 's nothing between you and <person> ? 
i ca n't write this anymore . 
i was just looking in an old annual and ... 
anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case ? she 's the expert . i need help . 
forget it ! i refuse ! 
how can i reach you ? 
sure do n't . mind if i ask where you got it ? 
i see a rhetorical question on the horizon . 
where it came from ? 
<person> ? and what baby is that ? 
do n't wan na register it . i 'll call you in a couple days . 
where 's <person> ? 
hey -- you ca n't do that . 
no . i just hastened the inevitable . he 's been ready to blow for years . i knew all it would take was a little push . so i , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer . 
what are the problems in stopping the heart ? 
you lost your head . 
sir , no one wants to work . they say the boss has left . 
no . 
nothing , i 'll call you , okay ? 
yes . i trust you . 
i do n't know . <number> minute he 's up in the air and makes love to me <number> times a day and tells me everything 's going to be great and he 's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he wo n't even talk to me . it 's driving me crazy . 
<number> people . 
you 're over reacting ! 
revenge . that 's what <person> wanted all along . to pay back the people who created him . 
yeah ? 
sacred herbs . <person> . do n't worry , we do n't smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe . that 's a white man 's myth . this is a sacrament . 
<person> <person> , <person> <person> . 
saw him do it ? 
he seems to think he 's entitled to it all . 
so you can see where you 're going when you crawl up his asshole . 
unprofessional . 
my grandboy 's been eatin ' a ton of breakfast every day . been out riding . must be the good air . you oughta see that little booger eat . i 'll bet he 's gained ten pounds . <person> 's out in the motor home ... 
my what ? 
that 's none of your fucking business . 
your majesty , i have been advised that you have received a letter from napoleon , offering a peace treaty , and that you have decided to accept it . 
who is this ? ! how dare you -- 
he 'll be here soon . 
-- he 's not my husband ! 
do n't worry , sugar . it ai n't past my bedtime ... are you flirting with me ? 
do you happen to know <person> <person> , the thirteenth earl of crabs ? 
why do all guys have to play stupid guitars ? it 's so typical ... either they 're into cars or guns or sports or guitars ... it 's so obvious ... 
is that a blessing , <person> ? 
he 's lying , <person> . <person> has . that 's why <person> 's always been useful . <person> still . and take your hand off your hip . 
do you think you have free license to be insulting ? believe me you have not . you think you 're superior , but you 're quite an ordinary man . 
who ? 
no , she just did n't want me going to jail , that 's all . 
what plans ? 
they 're much smaller than bacteria ... 
thanks , <person> . always a pleasure . 
i 'm interested in long-term expectations . 
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to . 
then we 'll have to get them out the old fashioned way . 
i 'll admit it 's a weakness . i do n't think he enjoys it . all right , he does enjoy it , so what ? what do you expect me to do about it ? 
what party ? 
yes , it is . i ca n't take seeing him , sitting there like a stone . 
do you want to learn or not ? 
< u > cheyenne < /u > ! what <person> ? 
<person> put . keep the camera trained on ... 
it 's over for you . 
it does n't mean anything . it was written before i went out there . before the ho . 
the marines . <person> for you . you must have served in korea . 
royal petition , delegates to court , judicial redress , economic boycott , bribery ... 
goodbye , sweetheart . 
were we always explorers ? 
and i 'm begging for my life -- and yours . 
... i 'm doin ' it for a friend . 
yes , chief - <number> other foreign powers have put <person> under surveillance . we 're around-the clock now , sir - i 'll keep you posted . 
shut up . i 'm not listening . 
the grammys . he 's got a lotta records up for awards . 
what lizard ? 
... maybe i should just move in here with you ... i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job . 
the old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee . 
this life ? 
you want to work uptown nights ? 
why not ? you 've done just about everything else on this operation . 
now what ? 
you . 
<person> dyle is dead . 
i 'm okay . i just do n't want to lis- ten . 
yes -- how about <person> ? 
the ledge , i know it well , or should i say < u > we < /u > know it well . 
what do you mean ? 
yengeese major give all property to magua . <person> give <person> <person> much wampum , many gifts , maybe <number> , <number> oxen . 
speed ... about twenty-two knots . <person> ... due north ! 
hell , they do n't do that and you know you 're not gettin ' through to 'em . 
there 's no time for you to be shocked by the truth , mrs. mulwray . the coroner 's report proves he was killed in salt water . just take my word for it . now i want to know how it happened and why . i want to know before <person> gets here because i want to hang onto my license . 
how ? 
that 's right . 
that 's trust . <person> <person> trusted me implicitly . 
that 's it ! yes , that 's it ! ... jacques ! 
chief ... it 's like none of this exists . i 'm sorry . 
i was havin ' a drink with my future wife . 
okay . 
let 's ... no one 's going to know , let 's go around the corner and we 'll get a drink . 
what do i mean ! you think this is a toy ? you think it 's your own little goddamn coloring book ... 
steps back . 
elegant words , sir , when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip . in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock . i learned at the knee of the master . 
a clerk . i 'm doing a typing course . i 'll be typing for england . 
you 're gon na be seeing a lot of me . you 're sure you do n't mind ? 
i did n't make up the name . it 's the steely dan song . and it was in the commitments . 
no - it 's just a lot of pressure for your first piece , that 's all . i mean , it 's not a half-page article , it 's a major undercover piece , <person> . look what <person> did to dutton - and that guy 's his cousin ! 
oh , ya know , that 's , uh - what can i say ? ... 
-- turn the goddamn camera off ! 
they 're trying to intimidate us . tell them to wait in the conference room . 
guys , guys -- you 're ruining my fucking moment here . now think about it -- 
you mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart ? 
i wonder what 's got into them ? 
edie . the commission . your subpoena . i know you got a subpoena . 
... it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter . 
no ... kisses to you . 
<person> ninotchka . <person> , poor ninotchka . 
i will . can my assistant come , too ? 
not particularly . 
lucky kid . 
have n't i ? i suppose i take it for granted . it 's just part of everyday life here . 
honey , nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them , well , we might have to make a counter offer . but we ca n't look too eager or we 'll get screwed . 
let it be <person> . let the police handle it . 
why then , there thou hast . we be lucky worse has not befallen us . 
really , dr. mccoy ; you can not ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn . logic suggests -- 
to keep what 's up there from getting down here ! it 's not the radiation i 'm worried about . 
hey , fuckball , i do n't need your permission . l.a. 's an open city . 
would you mind if i did ? i 'd like to talk to him . 
or <person> and <person> even . 
you think bad , and bad is what you get . 
you 're more gutless than i thought . 
<person> was not ... unbalanced when i married him . and he was not ... 'indifferent to women ' no matter what they said ! hunsecker i 'm not fighting with you , puss ... 
<number> <number> - - great . that would help . oh good , that 'll take no time . 
what ? 
t-tell him that ? 
no -- not even success . my writing is not for making a living -- it 's for living . not for other people , it 's for me . 
what ? what the fuck do you know about the third world ? you been there ? no ? no , well , i have . fuckers live like sardines in a can over there , you know . everything stinks . it 's true , there 's no , you know , law , no order . no nothing . the assholes come over here , they think it 's gon na be the same . 
they took it down , set fire to it , and threw it on the doorstep of room <number> at the buffalo butte motel . your room . 
i 'm buying . 
she 's buried . 
he sure is . 
buy some . 
ca n't you enjoy it quietly ? 
i need a favor . 
you 're going to have to make a final choice . in <number> hand , you will have <person> ' life . in the other hand , you will have your own . <number> of you is going to die . <person> <person> , will be up to you . 
what ? 
she 's your wife . why do n't you ask her ? anyway , i assume she signed the highly over rated <person> pre-nup . 
for being a bootlegger ? 
mmmmm ... sure smells good ... but <person> , do you realize <person> was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination , with no lawyer present , and nobody recorded a word of it ? i ca n't believe it . a police captain with <number> years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that <person> said would be inadmissible in court . 
i am not going to expose that little girl to that ... pervert down there . 
i 'm warning you . you do n't stall that bad attitude , no one 's gon na recruit you . 
you 're going high-cheese , dude -- 
no . 
i 'm sorry , <person> . you know i could never hold my liquor -- 
do we *have* to ? 
it 's been weeks since they spoke to me . since the coronation ... no signs ... nothing ... 
yeah , see you in hell . 
boy ! < u > somebody < /u > areound here sure has bad breath ! 
i sing now ? 
no we ca n't . that 's the problem . god knows it would beat hanging around with you ! 
it would have to be pretty damn good . 
sure . thanks . 
me , too . ca n't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the guardhouse . have we fed them ? like raw steak or something ? 
yeah . <person> . 
find something : extension cords , rope , wire -- we 'll have to tie them tight . 
it do n't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ai n't nothin ' else you can do . 
nor you for me . 
how 's about you give me those same directions . 
oh , come on ! you 're not pinnin ' this one on me . he left , i wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes . i was havin ' fun . 
guzman , <person> , <person> -- 
-- yes . 
thanks for your support , <person> . really appreciate it . 
that 's why the key did n't work , they changed the locks . 
of course ... 
i could n't ... oh , god . you ... came here ... to stop me ? 
sir , i 'm sure he would n't put himself -- 
mmmmm . 
good . 
he does n't have anything to cut with . 
i < u > live < /u > for midnight , when i can tear another of those suckers off . <person> got for me ? 
no ! now we 're inverted ! 
you 've seen a ship with black sails that 's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out ? 
he 's going to try <person> ... 
it 's like that thing with the yellow ribbon ... 
no , nothing . 
i do n't want to be reminded of what happened . 
it just slipped your mind . 
what you do n't know about women is a lot . 
well ... we are , of course , enormously grateful for your past efforts , but your task is done . now it 's time for negotiation ... and after many months of skillful work , our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english . you see , my dear <person> ... as it is written in the bible , `` to everything there is a season : a time for war , and a time for peace '' ... 
what family ? we never heard from them . i sold her house for them , made them money . 
how in the world did he get shot ? 
why the fuck am i here ? i feel like i 'm <number> years late for the prom . 
uh ... huh . 
you ca n't make me . 
he 's going back to the front this evening . i ca n't see him otherwise . 
uh-uh . no work . 
uh-huh . 
i ca n't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating . 
it was my fault . i slipped . 
that 's not possible . we ca n't leave here ... we 've got all this . 
who ? 
no , i have a cat . 
you <number> go ! i 'll call <person> ! 
no , <number> thing i finally know for sure , i 'll never function with a woman again . 
what 's the play ? 
-- almost every source we 've used has been republican , this guy 's a card- carrying democrat . 
i want to be alone . 
you did ? 
brought on by what ? 
i 'll go in that fuckin ' house right now ! i 'll give those disks to the < u > real < /u > fbi , you cocksuckingmotherfucker ! ! and i 've got < u > <person> < /u > ! < u > i 've got <person> < /u > ! ! 
why ? 
uh , huh ? 
do you ? 
of course ... well yeah , a bit . `` <person> <person> '' by the flying <person> <person> is an all-time top <number> , but i would n't play it at the club . it 's a country-rock ballad . everybody 'd go home . 
not really . oh , wait a minute . 
i did n't know you were into that sort of thing . 
i 'd be delighted to ... anytime you can show me the doubt . i 'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a christmas seals on it for her . 
sue , i 've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps . and this is the biggest step yet . if it helps , think of this as a < u > promotion < /u > . a merger of sorts ... <number> little words that can change our lives ... 
he 'll give us the documents . but i think he should be offered the ambassadorship to iran . then he 'll go without a whimper . 
what ? 
da mayor ai n't no bum . 
no -- 
that 's right . let 's get married , <person> . <person> 's find a justice of the peace and just do it ! 
nothing.. selling is selling . 
you di n't have no <number> , <number> , <number> . 
terrific . 
that <number> time was just the bumper . 
close . 
that happens to people . ok , go on . 
in west fork ? 
good boy , thank you , <person> . 
it is accepted , <person> <person> , with assurances of my deepest regard . 
it 's been a few years . 
that is a good shrubbery . i like the laurels particularly - but there is <number> small problem . 
no , no , no it 's so much more special than that ... you 'll see , you 'll be the first to ever see . i think this is something you 'll really love . 
no , no , no . that 's what you paid for it . <number> hundred pounds is what you paid for it . we do n't know what it cost us yet , for you <number> to have a good time , we do n't know the cost of that yet . 
good point <person> - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection i 'd expect from my new v.p . how can we , you ask , survive without <person> 's mother - our single greatest asset ? well , the truth is - we ca n't . so what am i saying ? will we find her again ? never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius . 
let it be rain , please let it be -- 
i did . i walked out the door . i felt like i was a scared little kid . i thought you knew that about me . i ran back to the bonfire , trying to outrun my humiliation . you said , `` so go '' with such disdain . 
i am riding to <person> myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap . 
no one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry . this world is in a state of static-mobility : we are at the same time moving and standing still . 
does n't sound very good to me . 
i 've got some things to tell you . 
it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck . i told them . i told you . 
no , but ... why did n't he stop it ? or did he get pleasure , watching us killing each other in his name ? 
the truth hurts . 
what happened after that ? 
let 's find you a drink . 
listen ! i know a place ! plato showed me before . an old deserted mansion near the planetarium would you go with me ? 
i thought you were above all that 
girls do n't love their father ? since when ? since i got to be sixteen ? 
george ... 
yes . a shame . still ... it 'd be worse if they died for nothing . 
it 's a simple question . 
you do n't have to . i told 'em you 're real careful . you never pick up money yourself . you always send someone , and i never know who it is . 
... do n't explain . 
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ? 
okay , not you rod . but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason . they 're tryin ' to kill us . fuck it man , we need to find out what 's going on . 
what 'll you do when it all goes wrong ? 
i said , no thanks . 
so is the town , i notice ! 
<person> said its done . 
wow just like <person> <person> . 
give me the bad news . 
i 've been looking for a guy -- not <number> of these south beach pussies . 
oh , yes , that 's right . 
you make respectability sound ... disrespectful . 
with us . 
... <person> ? 
i think <person> , would < u > love < /u > it ... 
who ? 
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted . 
good heart , at what ? 
yes . but he did n't show up . 
oh , <person> ! 
i have to go . 
sure . sure . 
i 'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up . 
thanks . 
i need its matrix coordinates , <person> . i 've got to nail that thing where it lives . 
peters and i will search the forward decks . <person> , take engineering . no hot-dogging , not on this <number> , alright ? 
yes . yes , that 's eminently fair of you . 
right . <number> <number> years before the crusades . 
the old lady ? 
i know . 
hey . this is my business . do i tell you your business . 
sixty . 
um-hmm . 
... they `` volunteered . '' a friend owns a large security company . 
i am not ! 
ai n't over yet . <person> is part of day ; separate , but equal . <person> is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark . 
the fuck you been doin ' to me ? 
she took my head . 
the police know about <person> <person> . we have to go another way . come on . 
was n't no problem a mine . 
get the hose ! we 've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him ! 
so ? 
i know where to find him . i 'll get him back . 
<person> wollsten ! 
i can make wishes like this come true . i 'll be just like <person> wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself â€” tell the truth -- 
c â€™ mon , you know what i like to hear ... 
it was stupid . 
i remember fine . i just did n't understand what was going on . they never told us anything except what to do . it took me a long time afterwards to figure things out . 
oh , i see . 
like when ? 
i believe you , and i see i must hasten to leave , for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men . 
frida , wait . do n't go . we can just sleep . i just want to wake up with you . 
eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to dr. knox at ten pounds for a large and <number> pounds for a small . that 's good business , <person> . 
i sculpt . i 'm really just starting to find myself . how old are you ? twenty ? you 're just like i used to be . i 'm forty-one . and i 'm glad i have n't gotten any recognition . it gave me time to develop . 
you can drop the act , it â€™ s over . 
are you kidding ? the last thing they expected was <person> <person> to get up close and personal . they wanted a follow up episode and would 've taken anything i had given them . i 'm not gon na tell <person> <person> that . i 'm gon na make him think his grey matter depends on it . when i told <person> and the brass about this coup , they practically shit a brick . i 'm talkin ' an adobe brick . they want to expand the show to a hour , and they want it on immediately . 
no . it 's not . 
he just lost his temper a little . 
you speak for me , son . 
his son is worse than he was . he 's smoother , so you do n't always hear him coming , but he 'll do anything to keep his range free . 
yeah . the graduation dance <person> <person> . it 's the last school event of the year . 
never saw him , was your basic hit and run . 
yeah , i like it , i 'm high up , i can see everything , you know ? it 's the cadillac of minivans . 
oh , i am thinking of the o'higgins of redmondstown . general o'higgins was a close friend of my wife 's dear father , colonel granby somerset . 
jack ... 
but the experiment was a failure . 
what a good poop you made in your diaper <person> <person> ! that 's right ! <person> loves you ! such a good boy you are ! 
for christ 's sake . <person> trudges down the tu=3del . <person> follows him . 
that 's not your affair . name . 
no , no ! just with her hands . 
you < u > are < /u > a lunatic ! 
shut up , and get me a hacksaw . 
what was <person> <person> 's physical condition prior to his death ? 
no i did not . i did not kill <person> <person> and then kill <person> <person> . is he accusing me ? ask him if he 's accusing me ! 
she has reason to be suspicious..does n't she ? 
i did n't mean it . 
yes , you did . 
<person> connell . did you love her ? 
i did , too . she told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did . 
-- of hadden industries . 
it 's not fair ! 
i know ... but i 'm a little pressed . 
i ai n't blamin ' her , <person> , i ai n't holdin ' it against her . she knew me back then ... an ' she seen what a no good sonofabitch i was ... an ' she wo n't allow how i 've changed . she just do n't know how i ai n't like that no more . 
can you now ? aah ... sheeps ' heads ! you learn more by getting out there and living . 
are you out of your mind ? 
`` 'why ? why do n't i get the opportunities ... ? '' 
thank you . i love you , too . 
well , she was very violent with the gown . she tore off a chunk of lace . if had n't been there i 'd have sworn she 'd used her teeth 
yeah , these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it . 
then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key , say open up , step inside , but you ca n't because it 's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was ... 
i ... i ... 
<person> was <number> of the first . <person> <person> . i 'm the president . 
champion to champion . 
you do n't work there anymore , <person> . 
cecile , you have to tell me . 
yeah . spent half his time in the infirmary . only reason he enlisted was his father . <person> did n't section him till last week . 
did n't he tell you ? that 's so like <person> . get dressed , we 're going out . 
that 's open to debate . 
i 've got to move . what do you have , <person> ? 
correct . now secure a sinex drop reading . 
verdell ? 
my friend , my best friend , <person> , was killed in silicon valley . 
and it makes it worse when i die , right ? 
that is correct , major . 
no ... she only comes to sit . <number> or <number> times a week . and i never ask questions , you know . as long as they 're well behaved . i must say that i 've wondered -- 
read it out loud . 
might be , shit . <person> , i know this town . i got my own fences . who the hell are you ? who put you in charge ? 
i 'm going to put you on the third floor . 
hey , where 'd you go ? 
wait , let me look at that ... you better come in here . 
yes , sir -- ma'am ... 
we will know when the next one sickens . until then you and i remain here . i will not bring the plague to my troops . 
<person> - 
it 's comin ' along ... want a beer ? 
no . 
that 's it ! 
what in sugar hill 's the matter with him ? 
you can kiss them if you want . feel them . they 're getting hard . 
cecile . 
well , i 've come to never expect greatness from a cab franc , and this <number> 's no exception . sort of a flabby , overripe -- 
what if they get in here ? 
it is . 
so the whole idea of selling the house -- do n't get me wrong , i 'd be glad to move to some better place , but if they are n't gon na pay us properly , i just do n't see the point . 
i 'm nothing then .

i don â€™ t think you â€™ re hearing me . 
i do n't know what to tell them . how 'bout the truth - i 'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice wo n't be an arcane , vanished idea they read about in history books , like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis . 
did we involve you , <person> , or did <person> <person> ? 
we 're in no hurry . i think we 'll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids . 
it 's a vicious cycle . 
these <number> guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits . i think <person> . they were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit ... i did what you would have done . 
both of us ... 
i barely managed to scrape up a bit for you . i thought if i made a kind of part payment -- 
like you said , maybe he knows where my ranch is . if he does , he 'll be waiting on the porch . 
you 're not from alaska ! where 'd you learn to dance like that ? ! and there are no starving people , are there ? ! 
yeah ... 
i said , `` everyone 's going to die , <person> . but <person> 's not going to die of aids . there 's a cure around the corner , and he plans to be around to take advantage of it . '' 
you win . 
oh , well , you know what i 've always talked about â€“â€“ build things . . . design new buildings â€“â€“ plan modern cities â€“â€“ all that stuff i was talking about . 
do n't tell me , i know about these things . i 've seen it before . it 's all right . it 's ... all right . you 're here . oh , <person> , i love you , son . 
cows . you know , cows ? 
i do n't know a loud crash . 
wow . 
admiral , may i ask you a question ? 
drop it . 
dobermans do n't talk . 
you listen to me , you fancy city man . you owe me money , and this car ai n't going nowheres until i get it . and if you take another <number> hours i 'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her . now get out of here ! you 're stinking up my garage . 
we 've found all of them . 
they hid my car -- 
do n't go there , <person> -- 
i told him you looked like me . 
no ... <person> 's . 
i do n't know . 
it 's <person> . 
remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus . 
oh , thanks very much . and there had better be something there for us . 
no reason . 
yeah , shit . <person> , man , you know . it 's hard work , you know ? 
our lives are simple . we have little need for material possessions . 
no , by road ? 
tell me what he said . 
if you say so . 
`` funny '' ? i dunno . but `` intriguing '' ... `` mindboggling '' ... perhaps `` headache-inducing '' ... sure . like , that moment , when you both came onstage ... 
i prefer distrusting you . it 'll keep us honest . 
get em ... . 
got ta wait 'til visitin ' days . 
did you see the old man on the -- - 
know what ? 
i told the d.a . everything i know . 
okay ... .. 
coming for you ... 
the kid in here . the other <number> when we come out . 
well , like he says , it 's mostly odd things he does , helping like ... here and there , as it might be . 
nobody chickened . 
what a smart kid you are ! <person> , eat . 
you could n't hang me in your bedroom -- i 'll make a note of it . where 's my secretary ? 
it 's the best collection i 've ever seen . 
no matter what you think , you did come up with something unique . open it . 
you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing . it 's all my responsibility . so i 'll tell you what <person> , you stay off of my bridge , and i 'll stay out of your galley . we 'll get along that way . 
you got it . 
the human brain is a highly complex organ , elaine , perhaps the most complex next to the bladder . let me show you . <person> 's problem is in this area . this area , this area , here , here , here , under here , here ... 
ok . but do me <number> last favor , will you . can you give me <number> hours ? that 's all i ask -- just <number> hours to sleep before tomorrow . i suspect it 's going to be a very difficult day . 
we were young ... remember that little place on <person> <person> we used to go to ? 
what do i care about your mother- in-law ! you 're still working for this paper , are n't you ! or are you ? 
why ? 
some of 'em . 
no . 
your dead friend <person> ? 
i 'm telling you , baby , maybe we better get out of here . 
nothing . the bio buster ? i do n't get it ... 
oh , could you , <person> <person> ? 
i suppose i could come to him in a dream . i do n't know . that 's the best i can think of right now . 
ca n't think . he 's dead . in ireland . he was a soldier . went there like a fool . 
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity ? 
i was n't angry with you i was angry with him . 
we 've worked up several military scenarios . before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options , i 'd like for us to adopt a rule . if we are going to strike , we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational . because once they are , i do n't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched . 
you 'll always be my hero , <person> . <person> always always . we 're bringing other elements in , we 're focusing on endorsements -- it 's not about handholding anymore . we 're no longer babysitters -- 
yeah , deal . give me the <number> dollars . 
you ca n't see it , can you , <person> ? i mean , you 've never been able to see it . i came after him . and i 'm gon na get him . i 'm goin ' with him all the way . the pool game is not over until <person> <person> says it 's over . is it over , <person> ? 
but , as you are so fond of observing , <person> , i 'm not human . 
do you really think so ? 
mm-hmm . i ca n't get to you . you have to come to me . 
it 's those feathers . they tickle . 
because i care , i 'm a fucking fool ? 
you gave us names ? what are you , the `` face '' of the fantastic four now ? 
but she expects you to marry her ? 
<person> guessed . 
you 're right . you 're right . i do n't know what i was thinking . i 'll tell you what . it does n't have to be published . nobody ever has to see it . i 'll just keep it for myself . no one will ever have to know it exists . 
you crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit , and <number> starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this ! we have witnesses ! 
do what the gentleman says , <person> . 
i do n't think so . it 's on all the cameras , and check this out . the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded . 
are you sure ? 
did you know that you 're a very wealthy woman ? 
who 's the greatest cocksucker in the world ? c'mon -- 
and i 'm going to win . 
i 've brought you something to keep you warm , mrs. stone -- 
but you 're happy here -- you like your work â€”- 
who says i ca n't ? you 're a newspaper man .

i do n't . and i 'm not going to try . 
you mean you do n't know where you were ? 
there was a woman . she was trying to help me . i watched him murder her .

you 're red hot , damn it . get in there . i 've got to get more ice . 
who was she ? 
huh ? whadda you mean ? 
but i thought ... 
you can do anything you want if you set your mind to it . 
i 'm telling you it 's not that . 
what a tragedy ... what a waste of a life ... 
deeds ! who do you think i 'm talking about ? 
diff'rent types who wear a day coat , pants with stripes and cutaway coat , perfect fits ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . 
do n't do her no good to go into a tree . 
okay , so you had a dream about this place . tell me . 
excuse me ? 
this is totally different . i 'm talking about avoiding what you 're talking about . that 's the distinction . i have not made the commitment yet . i am not married . i have not said the words . in a few days , i might get married , and if i do , then i wo n't be doing stuff like this anymore . otherwise , what 's the whole point of getting married ? 
you ask him if you like , but i would leave him to it if i was you . 
you do n't show for chicago , everyone 'll know there 's something going on . 
briggs , <person> , movement beyond the boxed fuselage .

lenin 's tomb .

day jobs , yeah . i 've tried them . turn right . 
then blame the one who made her ... 
why would n't she leave ? 
what do you mean ? <person> did n't provide them ? 
to hear them read <person> . 
will you let me go then ? 
did n't offer the kinda growth and challenge i need . 
great . i 'll pick you up around <number> o'clock . is that good ? 
there 's another thing i 've been thinking about . i do n't know how you feel about the idea , <person> , because we 've never talked about it . but i 've been thinking lately , i 've been thinking we should get married sometime . you and me . 
no , not here in pennsylvania , she went to russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back . just when she was about to go home , she got caught , and they killed her . 
i do n't know ...

well , you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you ? it works .

whenever i compliment simone , you take the credit . 
i do n't need a geography lesson , <person> . 
oh yeah , he 's alive . technically . 
i like it . 
you better be keeping your mind on business . it 's not just me you got to worry about . i 've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder .

we 'll be okay once she realizes i 'm not a new toy . 
'help me , <person> me . ' help me get up . 
a prairie oyster , sir . [ <number> ] 
the <number> in question are third generation <person> <person> , constructed of skin-flesh culture , selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought , para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program . are you with me ? 
i 'll take your suggestion under advisement , princess . in the meanwhile --

i 'm not normal . 
ecentus stultorum magister . 
-- `` oh , no , <person> , i 'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- what ? what do you mean he 's dead ? it 's all my fault , i may as well have killed him myself ! '' 
she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession . do you know what confession is ? all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul . 
now that i 'm dead , the spotlight 's off her . 
well , you were ! 
what were you saying , commander , about the bomb ? 
mikey --

lem me break . 
i do n't know . i wo n't be . 
i 'm fine . 
what are you talking about ? when did you sleep last ? do you know what your trouble is ? you 're blind . you 've been here so long you ca n't see what is happening . we must unite . we need unity . we need action . ) we have come to a time when we must ... . 
actually , no , i 've changed my mind . i should n't have called . 
i thought you said that was n't a compliment . 
went -- 
yes , of course . what do you want ? 
nothing you could n't find out from reading the papers . and you 're already wrong on <number> count . 
no . i ai n't see anything like that . 
maybe i ai n't . 
dad , this is amazing . if you play this backwards , it says `` <person> is dead . '' 
that 's why they call it `` fuckin ' with ya . '' now you wan na hear how we retaliate ? 
those are canaries , miss . does n't this make you feel awful ? 
maybe <number> , <number> months after <person> . i was visitin ' my cousin , <person> <person> , in savannah , and we were at some kid 's house whose parents were out of town . a girl comes up to me that was real tall , taller than me . 
<person> -- 
and the hell everybody else , right ? 
'course i will , <person> . no problem . no problem at all . i 'll tell him next time i see him . 
scratch will do for the evening . may i -- join you ?

couple of months . 
yes ! he 's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens -- and *you with it* , mr . governor ! 
how should i know ? it 's broken . see what you can do . 
i think you do know but you wo n't or ca n't tell me . i said before it was going to be my last try , and i meant it . i ca n't think of anything else to do . i wish i could . we usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down . then it comes up again and everything 's fine . but not this time . you know there is n't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between <number> adult people . <person> , <person> . 
so i followed him ... 
i do n't understand . 
i 'll say . you killed his goddam girlfriend instead . now they 're onto <person> . they 're at the brecker hotel even as we speak . 
levi , you got about <number> hours before armed men show up here , put you on a plane to washington , and lock you in a very small dark room . i suggest you talk to us . 
it 's okay , <person> . trust me . 
we got ta get up there or we 're gon na be gargling saltwater . where 's <person> ? 
endearing . 
a planet in federation space ... 
what was she running from ? 
you got out , <person> . you 're here . you 're my christmas . 
go on , there 's a good boy . 
it 's the event horizon . she 's come back . 
<person> von schnechter . prewar .

oh yeah , sure . when i was a kid i had a crush on the prom queen . <person> <person> . she had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited . <person> <person> . you know you look a little bit like her . 
no , but she 's got ta be at least a month late . 
if it 's too far , then we 'll drown . but if we don â€™ t try then we 'll never know . 
in order to do that , i 've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it . 
i do n't know if you do n't know -- 
you think it 's a conspiracy ? 
it 's not a habit . i do it because i like it .

<person> , what are you talking about ? what malfunction ? what day is this ? 
plot a course for kronos , lieutenant . 
too perfect . too beautiful , too talented , too sophisticated , too everything -- but what i want . 
why you do n't feel love ? not allowed ? dead inside , maybe ? you make yourself dead already so they ca n't kill you ? in-vulnerabo ? bullshit ! 
i am not talking to you , bitch . 
you think i 'd let him run loose without a chaperone ? <person> ferrets their rat-holes out , i map them . then we blow them all to kingdom come . 
can you be any more specific ? 
tom , <person> would like to see you in the garden . and will you ask <person> to bring us some coffee . and remember to say 'please ' . 
ca n't afford to take chances . 
i 'm sorry , <person> . we did all we could . you 've been a real trooper . tell him i 'll call back . 
so now you tracked me down . what d'ya think ? 
i 'd hoped i was finished with all that . but ...

why ? 
yeah , baby , i know what you like to hear ... 
no , i 'm sorry , darling , i told you i wo n't be home for a few days . 
you 're kidding . 
we ? 
<number> <number> ... 
-- the promotion says : buy any <number> healthy choice products and get <number> miles of airline travel or <number> for purchases made with a special coupon . so in the supermarket , you notice their products , first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $ <number> - that 's a pretty good deal ... .but then i noticed they had soup at <number> cents a can ... ..and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it 's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at <number> cents a cup . now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label . that 's those little bar codes , you know ? the universal product codes ? 
<person> on , chief . 
who gives a fuck . 
lower . 
well give me some then ... i 'm starving .

we have to avoid injuring it . what we really need is some electric animal prods . 
no . better than tits -- a < u > star < /u > ! 
you would n't say that , if you could see me . 
i guess . 
not as bad as yours , pal . 
ai n't our way . we go all on <number> , <number> on all . <person> <number> of us , you fight us all . that 's the cowboy way . 
want to go out for a drink ? i mean , we 're both sitting here , and <person> <person> 's in jail ...

no , i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines . 
<number> years . 
i know . because i remind you of her . the one that 's dead . and not even that , very much . 
it 's spelled different , but basically ... now you said it twice ; just <number> more time , and i 'll be free . and then < u > you 'll < /u > be free . 
it 's more a place where souls are found , <person> <person> . 
march man in tennessee , sniff the pines ... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin ' down by the river . what you got <person> ? let 's see <number> <number> and what ?

< u > they < /u > said he was behind an extortion scheme . 
i know . that 's why i 'm attracted to you . i mean , you make me nervous . you 're intimidating . maybe it 's my curiosity/self-preservation thing , but all i can really think about right now is kissing you . 
do n't con me . do n't try ... 
whatta you mean ? me ? 
only the son of a pezzonovanta .

chicken blood on the crops .

what in god 's holy name are you blathering about ? 
honest ? 
spock ... 
thanks . 
i do n't want to know . 
oh , well we would n't want to disturb your guests , would we ? 
welcome . 
huh ? you 're implying i 'm some kinda psycho criminal ? 
i 'm her father -- supposed to be , but i 'm not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i 've been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight . 
i heard he was drunk at toby 's last night and got in a fight with <person> . he drove off without her ... 
so , it was a draw . 
no rock . when she came to the bar , sans rock . 
i 'm playing white , remember . you ca n't tell me which pieces to move . it does n't work that way . 
what 's <person> ' number ? 
anything good ? 
< u > <number> < /u > to go . 
you recognized my style . see , you 're very good . you 're a natural at this . 
you want to spend the rest of your life in the temple ? 
it was yellow . 
you followed me here , did n't you ? 
that will mean another interview , wo n't it ? 
no . i told you everything , you lied to me . i would have done anything for you . 
*no* ! 
you like him . 
what you say ? 
progressive convents . vanity . it sounds awful . it sounds just like this place . 
okay , what do you want ? what dumb favor do you want me to do ? 
whatsa matter ? 
what do you mean , `` you '' ? 
no , but i passed by it a couple of times . it 's out in the middle of nowhere . it seems like a rowdy place , so there would n't be a lot of police . and it 's open from dusk till dawn . you said meet you in the morning . 
say there 's just <number> `` mole '' working there , like <person> at the doj . how do we know he 's not the guy we 've contacted ? or she ? or the guy she works for ? 
oh really - you must remember me from when i was a regular customer . 
maybe you can empathize with this -- maximum fine . <number> months in jail , <number> months house arrest . sentence to begin immediately at the orchard valley correctional facility . <person> closed . this court is adjourned . 
hey hey , i 'm not messing with your special lady -- 
what 're you saying ? 
that wo n't work , chick . this boy 's honest , not stupid . 
yeah , but they 're complaining . 
you do n't wan na put beer over mai-tai . 
oh , <person> . that 's awful . what are you going to do ? 
i go up to this camp <number> months ago . nobody there . <person> for years . 
i guess , but not because of the way he looked or anything . he 's just so different , somebody new to have a conversation with . i 'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they 're going to buy the station wagon , you know ? it 's just boring . i do n't know , he was just different . and he 's really on about truth a lot , being honest , and i like that , i felt comfortable around him . after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room . 
you do n't understand . i 've never felt this way about anybody ! 
i do n't know , yet . we 'll just have to watch our chance . when it comes i 'll know what to do -- i hope i 'll know what to do . 
it makes me weepy just to remember it . so we were fine again , and then she got married to <person> who 's a womaniser and a bit of a yob , but quite nice really , makes tv commercials . what about yours . 
sure . 
you coming along ? 
got it . 
yes , i think so . 
i know , i know -- 
that 's too bad . 
i think it 's best if we do n't ask too many personal questions -- i want to keep things on a professional level . 
we 're going to be making so much money , none of this is going to matter - 
she is beautiful . 
what ? ... oh yes ... <person> ... create ... verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods ... <person> ... just sit down for a minute . 
dig the square wardrobe ! 
mother ... go away ! 
hair and make-up ? 
we ca n't find ... ... <number> of our guys . 
supernumerary . it means better than expected . 
well , it 's ... it 's sort of an ... an ` incident ' really ... 
why are you doing this obviously macho feat ? 
ewwww ! thank you , <person> . 
sit down , i 'll show you how we 're going to do it . 
got it .

oh ? darrell taking good care of you ? 
listen to this . a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning . when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish ' ... 
and hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon ? ... no , thank you . i 'll take my chance down here . 
what are your beliefs , <person> ? 
under a condition red alert , the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops . 
hell no . you think i 'm crazy ? 
that 's it ! `` follow my voice . we 'll try no manhood here . '' see you at dinner . 
never heard of a double-cross ? 
you 're not going to be a pop-pop . and <person> 's not going to be a ma . somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . i friggin ' hope . 
please . it 's my job . 
not the <number> thing . i used to think i could at least some way put things right . i do n't feel that way no more . 
let me in . 
hey , <person> . 
thank you . if you told me <number> years ago we 'd be living here , i would never have believed it . do you live around here ? 
well , that 's dumb . 
i see . 
yeah . he delivers the goods on zammito . if we got what we wanted we 'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the van gogh and the other paintings are . 
i hate it when you get like this . this catwoman is becoming an obsession . i say we call it a night . <person> is a big day for us ... 
this -- is -- the -- <number> -- for -- us . 
the audience will want its money refunded , believe me . 
why ? 
<person> as well . 
sure . sure . 
yeah . 
what about the gun ? 
what did he want ? 
my wedding tackle . 
of course . 
no , no he 's not . 
they know . 
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works ? 
which brings me to rule number <number> : which says , fuck rules <number> and <number> , skip bail and take off . 
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir . and you will give me occasion . 
honey . what were you doing with that ? 
<person> -- - 
that 's not what we were taught . 'look out for number <number> ' -- that 's daddy 's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold . 
orson . stop . just stop 
and you never will . but i 've got a job to do , too . where i 'm going you ca n't follow . what i 've got to do you ca n't be any part of . <person> , i 'm no good at being noble , but it does n't take much to see that the problems of <number> little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . someday you 'll understand that . now , now ... 
yes . 
yeah . hey , why was n't i injured ? 
yes ! 
a novice . 
i 'm not supposed to talk to strangers , not even nuns . 
that 's not true . here i am . 
<number> minutes for ten dollars . 
yeah , maybe . 
you 're <number> fuckin ' days from the record , get through this and i'ii do anything for you , you just got ta get through this -- 
your stereo broke ? god , i could hardly stand that . i live on music . 
listen to me , fella ... 
dodge ... he 's not like me at all . but he makes sense . <person> walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew . i understand why he 's here . but you ... you 're no seeker . you 're negative . 
abrams . yes . how are you today ? 
yes , but i 'm afraid -- 
who ya calling ? 
just like <person> . 
no , no , no , i 'll be fine . i 'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning . 
why do you smoke ? 
then we 're screwed . 
she held up very well . 
let me . 
it 's ok . 
excuse me , sheriff . as we explained to your associate here , there 's been a mistake . we did n't kill anybody . now , as for the bootlegging , we happen to work for a very important man in new york . 
actually it 's a nightmare . i 've been desperate for a shag , but watching him suffer was just too much fun . you should try it with <person> . 
what ? 
but did n't you avoid contact with ms. torres , after you found out she had aids ? she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her , is that correct ? 
i am . 
and we 're at safe maximum depth already ... . stop engines ! 
really . you sleeping ? 
close ... i do n't know ... just get the hell ... . 
you 'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you 'll see here . last week i saw a purple martin . and the week before that , i saw a solitary vireo . that 's rare . 
once the ship is secured , we 'll bring you on board -- 
what about sing ? 
uhura , i had the strangest dream . i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise . 
i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom . 
i do n't have a weapon . 
for someone so young . 
i do n't know . 
by learning the ancient art of ninjetti . it is the genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the ninja . it is the perfect union of mind , body and spirit . 
she 's going to rest now . 
you and me are checking the other ways in and out . 
is it about a pirate 's daughter ? 
when they 're all you have , you kinda become an expert . 
what could be more restful than this ? ... excuse me , what is it that you want to try ? 
i figure he ducked in <number> place and ducked out another . 
i 'm fine . you rest . 
it is . we know that . and it 's enough that we know . just think of the girls . they 're still young . we never see them . i lost my parents . i do n't want them to lose theirs ; i do n't want them to grow up without a mother and father ... 
what 's this about ? 
come on . leave their stuff alone . 
do i know you ? 
<person> closed , okay ? thirty seconds . 
no way ! <person> 's great . can we stay out all night ? 
fine . 
does that mean you 'd consider it in <number> weeks ? you do n't have to answer now . he wants me to check the deed restriction anyway . you take your vacation , <person> . <person> 'bye ! 
what is it , madame ? 
who 's hysterical ? nobody 's hysterical ! 
the other guy drew first . 
poison gas . 
who ? 
not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone , brian . this could be a great opportunity to move ... beyond a fire engine . 
ho-yaaahh ! ! ! 
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident ? 
yeah , for a while . 
pardon ? 
not very well , i 'm sure . i 'd probably start doping myself . or maybe i 'd ... 
you do n't sound as if you liked him very much . 
where 's my brother ? 
sid is smart enough to know you 'd check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he 's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena . 
i had doubts too . i always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain . but something happened ... 
any microorganisms ? 
do n't worry about it . but when it happens and i 'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning , do n't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either . 
he raped her and ... and ... and he murdered her ... he cut her up with knifes ... 
uh oh ... 
okay , <person> , let him have it . now get out of here , little fellow , we 've got things to do . 
and he was there ? 
i ca n't , i 'm gon na get punished more ! 
sure , because your new stuff 's a bunch of crap . <person> , people are sick of you . the wrestling ... the hoaxes ... 
i 'm not going alone . i 'll take gregoire with me . he 's a good <person> , and he wants to impress me now . 
-- i 'm just trying to make a point . this idea is that fucking bad . 
trust me , this ai n't <number> of those times . 
i do n't want you dead , woman , i want the the truth ! 
they say it 's fantastic . at least that 's what i read in a men 's magazine . so who are the <number> lucky ones ? 
you would n't be here if it was n't true . it 's true , right ? 
well ... 
a couple of weeks , i think . 
heavens no ! i do n't have the time . but i like to keep in practice and poor glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form . do you disapprove ? 
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident . we try to remember we 're a military organization . 
fuckin-a . 
<person> ? 
we 're conversing ... oh my , the names of the entire cabinet has slipped my mind . what are they ? 
what ... what must i decide ? 
oh no . 
really -- what happened in <number> ? 
soo , fare-the-weel , darlin ' . i 'm gone on my way , my wagons are loaded , my whip 's in my hand ... 
we have to destroy him . 
did she tell you anything ? 
for what ? ! 
okay . <person> . 
if you 'll let me go i could tell them what -- 
yah , that 's a good <number> . 
that far ? 
hallelujah , brother , now get back in bed ! 
winning . 
hey , <person> , i 'm hit . 
look deeper . 
you think we kept you out in tarrytown just to have you go walkin ' with a corner saloon hoodlum like <person> <person> ? now get back to tarrytown , before i put a strap to you . 
absolutely . just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator . 
the truth is that i heard between <number> and <number> shots . i 'm not going to lie for you . 
terminated . 
yeah . 
anything . 
get away from me ! 
yeah , i know ; but you 're adding fake laughs . 
what you gon na do when somebody comes to collect ? fuck 'em ? fuck 'em a thousand times ? the kind of people who 'll come after that <number> , they wo n't tolerate if you do n't have it . they wo n't just cut your face up a little . stupid cunts ! 
what man had access to her ? 
here here ... 
what makes you think they 're even interested ? it 's only a quarter of a <number> -- it 'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping . as a taxpayer -- 
yeah - lets shove off . 
do you miss it ? 
it was in the <number> 's , everything was different . i was well known for my parties , <person> knew what they were . it was for girls like her to meet men , men who could get them parts , if they made the right impression . nothing happened to her that she did n't invite , in <number> way or another , no matter what she said afterwards . 
buy you a drink ? 
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles . 
what ? 
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ... 
i 'll live ... 
so you 're a one-girl guy ? 
he stayed a long time . 
we 're using- 
i mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year . 
they 're not guns . they 're particle throwers . 
i ran back in to get the phone . 
that 's why i say <person> -- <person> <person> . he jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench . he 'll take orders . 
she 's walking back towards the door . 
oh right . you met <person> . 
really ? 
it 's alright , i guess . you hear from anyone made it out of b.a . alive ? 
hide it behind the gas station . then we can get the hell out of here . 
i have been given nothing . god makes men what they are . 
kramer ... there 's something i ought to tell you . 
the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out . 
after the wedding , which we 're paying for ourselves , and this house ... 
malcolm , where are you ? we 've been calling all over the city . 
i was n't worried about us . 
i think i 'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination . 
have you ever heard of the calan ? 
you did n't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that ? what were you doing ? 
that 's right . 
see the tape . then we can discuss my heart . 
that 's what i been telling everybody ! <person> dance ? 
because they 're all the same . it 's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who ca n't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door . they 're ridiculous . 
<person> parker , tell them we 're doing our best . stall . 
put me down ... . 
reticular fibers . we ought to be clear of them soon . 
anonymous . 
who ? 
you 're asking me ? i do n't even know how to load this thing . 
i do n't believe in little floating people ! there is no magic ! 
there 's something else kinda interesting ... 
you 're not vice , are you ? do you work for the los angeles police department , or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ? 
no -- 
i do n't wan na talk about it . 
ray , start the tour program . 
i just love being a sister . 
no ... just down the street , the amigo tower . 
and you 're mine . 
catch you later . 
i think i should go home . 
come on , frank . let 's go . please . 
tell 'er to go straight to hell ! 
-- <person> , you 're gon na be late ! 
okay , <person> . 
did you cry when he died ? 
a rich , possibly fat , slob . 
i just want to get married . 
-- why do n't you ask <person> ? 
there is more in the diary than just the map . 
standing next to my window .
