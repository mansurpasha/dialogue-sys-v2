okay , well here 's yours ... `` who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken ? not this one ! stunning bod , very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer . '' 
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human . if it does n't look human , it 's a reptile or a big insect or something , having human values , human understanding . 
someone 's been doing all these things . 
<person> left ? 
oh , well , then -- we 'll ask him for you .

'' `` go win the cadillac . '' graff . he goes out and buys . he pays top dollar for the ... you see ? 
look , i do matrimonial work , it 's my metiay . when a wife tells me she 's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience .

well , i 'm ... glad to hear that – 
big.com . that internet thing . 
i got the twister game for later ... 
back then , he was still a da , and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom . you have to understand , these people were the dregs of society . but once they saw their children ... he decided he would do whatever he could for them . he 's that way , you know , paternal about certain things . precrime . the precogs . you . 
do n't point at me . 
and then i got scared , <person> , and closed the doors . i . . . i . . . i . . . 
oh ! you caught me . 
say no more . i 'm off to grab a drink . still favor <person> ? 
not that poor . 
gee , that 's an idea , <person> . that 's an idea there . i wonder now ... 
but not even before , when he was living upstairs ? 
i heard how you talked to him . 
kids are great . 
it ’ s part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium . 
he 's a gambler . 
that she 's a nun ! that chick you 're looking for -- she 's a nun ! 
<person> christ , <person> , we ca n't leave a crime scene like that . put a unit out there . 
<number> <number> .

it 's about the burglary . 
show ... 
he 's just going through a phase -- 
easy , <person> . no vendettas on my ship . now : remember what i told you about <person> ? watch the grass , watch the trees , watch the shit house , be on your toes , and if we get committed , do n't hesitate to empty that sucker .

hi . 
i hardly knew the guy . why be impolite to strangers ? 
she sued you for back payments of child support ? 
he means prison , <person> <person> . 
no you ca n't . it ... it gets so bad that i become a werewolf . 
my very point . here 's another <number> ... 
people more serious about their work . you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it ? 
just thinking out loud . 
pity . then you 'll both have to die . 
how did you -- 
i do n't like to assert myself , <person> , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you 've been involved in a very stressful situation . 
can we get to him ? 
then the answer 's yes ... 
that lets us off the hook . 
i am giving her a chance . why do n't you get off my back ? 
that 's not what the dreams say he 's doing . 
<person> ' place . 
'fraid not . 
yes , dad . 
<person> hotel , <person> <person> . <person> stop worrying . i figure we 'll do a sidebar on what it 's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town . also <person> 's onto something , digging into his background . 
alonzo ? what are you talking about ? where are you ... ?

i was hoping <person> and i could talk . 
it must have been safe . 
yeah , right . 
i do n't know . <person> 's left orders here not to let you in the building . 
terrence and i came down here to do serious work . for centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate . 
hmmmm ... after you left , it was difficult , and then lily -- that 's your mother -- she took ill and died ... we have n't shown a picture since forty-eight . 
good . 
he 's with his dying mother ! 
what am i gon na do with flowers ? 
not like this . never like this . <person> , i swear to you -- if i 've learned <number> thing , it 's that moments like this are rare . and i will thank god for them every moment of every day . 
the crime commission has offered a reward of ten <number> dollars for <person> ' capture . 
even to the hat . <person> old dreamer , too . <number> look at you and i can see him , back of his old roll top desk , hat and all , getting out his paper . <person> kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle . <person> <person> , editor and publisher , and champion of lost causes . 
thanks , but it 's under control . 
-- do you want ice ? 
yeah . it was quite good actually . some bits i really liked . 
well , riddle me this , <person> . how do you feel about the fact that you 're never gon na see <person> again ?

but ca n't you give me any idea ? 
you want to try it ? 
that 's what i 'm saying . 
yes i can , <person> . and until you start givin ' me some straight answers : i 'm gon na assume that some mischief has been goin ' on here . 
then what good is he ? 
<person> will eat him alive ! 
truce .

and it was the last . has n't written a letter since . not even a birthday card . 
rogers is n't even pretending . he is n't just scared anymore . he 's sick . <person> <person> told me last night he has n't known rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years .

i did n't knock <person> off . 
you 'll live . 
i would n't do it . 
but you 're not < u > done < /u > ! 
it looks like -- and i quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind . ' 
<person> said how <person> murdered a man . 
like helping a sick kid ? 
i do n't know . 
if it does n't have a pool , we 're looking for a new place .

you wanted to see me , <person> ?

no ! it would be something better ! something < u > impressive < /u > . the biggest moneymaker you 've ever had ! 
yeah . parts of them . anyway , in purgatory , <person> and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain ... seeing all these other guys who sinned ... 
what are you going to do about it , shoot me ? 
i do n't know . maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun . 
the same type that decides to carve into her stomach . 
stick up ? 
where 'd she drop her cherry ? 
what happened ? 
maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ... 
major , you 're talking like <number> of them !

i told you ... sooner or later you 'd have to trust me ... 
the boy worries me . it 's silly , but it 's like there was something still between him and his dad . 
it ca n't be all that personal . 
i did n't do anything wrong . 
nonsense , <person> <person> - i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man . 
i think we got a white house consultant linked to the bugging .

kitteridge , you 've never seen me very upset . 
yes , <person> is a despicable twit . i hate him . 
<person> clay . call me <person> .

i tell you this is half sold . 
fuck it . <person> . 
that 's where i was going ... <person> <person> . 
he is ? 
no ... .the <person> ! 
dude , nothing is fucked . come on . you 're being very undude . they 'll call back . <person> , she kidnapped her -- 
and it came to life and divorced you . i know all about that . now my idea is this : somebody swipes the girl 's body , takes impression , makes a mold , produces wax figure ... <person> ! ... peddles it to this old skate down there ! 
yes , awfully tempting , was n't it ? 
well , i did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my masters degree . 
of course not . it 's so easy you almost feel sorry for them . 
why not ? 
yeah , right -- when i see it . 
well ... ok ... 
there is a man 's arm in my bed . 
he tried to kill us . if not just now , then in the helicopter . that 's all the authority i need . 
yes'sir . 
i did what i thought was right . 
and that 's why you 're losing your bet ? 
could be . 
you 're always picking on me . it took me <number> hours to get those little gadgets in those holes , and you screw it up in a minute . hey , look ! 
well , you got it now . 
i know it 's hard to believe , son , but this place , this little place this was n't a theater then , this was a palace ! any man , woman , child , you , me , it did n't matter , you bought your ticket and you walked in and you ... 
everybody ! back here ! 
i ... mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that 's where i have to go . 
my father -- was not -- a pirate ! 
what 's he want ? 
ahh , good . then i will see them . dismiss the rest . 
but i do n't mind telling you , i 'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end ... 
i 'm afraid this is all for the moment . 
and no elbows on the table ! 
yeah . sure . 
they 're really nice people , <person> . they 're like us ... 
your letter came yesterday . 
activated . <person> drop checked . correcting course . on tangential course now , orbiting . crossing the terminator . entering night side . 
your honor , i submit there were no complaints until <person> began knocking on doors , drumming up business . and the dust , which counselor refers to , has appeared on only <number> occasions . each time it has been examined and the results ... 
when do you want the assembly ? 
i bought the tickets . <number> for her and <number> for me . it was my idea . 
since when are you such a smart shopper ? 
night . 
i 'm gone . i 'll talk to you tomorrow . 
well , she twigged by the time she was <number> or <number> that daddy was n't in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing <person> in a worldwide tour of othello . 
what ? 
do n't worry about it . he owes me some favors . 
what ? 
we are n't barbarians . 
he 'll be ok . 
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , <person> mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss . 
i was scary stuff , radically advanced . it was shattered ... did n't work . but it gave us ideas , it took us in new directions ... things we would never have thought of . all this work is based on it . 
<person> ’ t look like nothing . 
that means he probably will kill <person> . 
yes . 
<person> . 
long story . not that interesting . 
<person> ? selectman of the village ? me ? 
it is n't much , really , you see , there 's this little boat . well , not so little , really . and it 's not going where it 's supposed to go and ... 
some kind of half-wit , no-good , big-haired , bimbo , i bet . 
you asked . 
ask me a question . 
alright , stay on the phone . 
no , i 'm sure it wo n't . move over there . let 's make believe nothing happened . and when we get to the next station , get off . 
not everything . but enough to implicate us . 
in a harem . 
the ghost can be barefoot . < u > give < /u > < u > me your shoes < /u > ! 
no it is n't ! you 're dead ! 
i suppose that 's your wagon in the river .

oh , no , no , no ... <person> , look ! an alien ! 
the details of my life are quite inconsequential . 
<person> 's been feeding him . 
some of them are . 
my name is <person> . 
i have a letter , ma'am . 
i had a friend that used to chew glass for a living . in the circus .

by storytellers , of all things . every so often , they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence . then it 's held prisoner for a while . in the story . 
actually that 's rather an intriguing idea ... 
here 's my deal -- do n't waste my time . what do you want me for anyway ? you do n't even know me . 
the rich kind . <person> , man . the way you smoke that shit is suicide . 
didya look at the border ?

i heard about your stunt . that 's swell , king . just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane . it 's a perfect beginning for the life we 're going to lead . it sets just the right tempo . come on , king . you 're lagging . 
close call , but she 's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious vatican organization . <person> , it 's time to go to the principal 's office ... . 
you just picked that wrong war to be a hero in . 
he never told me . 
ah , yes ! i was a set-up . i was the made-to-order witness . where is he now ? 
goodness , <person> <person> , i 've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner .

<person> up , i wan na watch hbo . 
trask wants to talk with you . 
leave her out of this . 
what was he after ? 
make that <number> . 
okay , okay . it 's not my job , but what the hell . i 'll do you a favor . he takes the grocery bags from her . 
yeah , does n't hurt himself , just spins it around next to his eyeball . 
the little ... 
after the cold war ... 
mercutio ! <person> art consortest with <person> ? 
tom .

how i 'm going to bask in reflected glory ! people are going to point to me and say , `` there goes <person> <person> - brother of the foreign secretary . '' 
ya think ? 
who said write ? <person> , <person> ca n't read . you got ta tell it to him-tell him something for <person> . 
it was amazing . 
yes ? 
yeah , but the first lady ... could n't we start with a cousin or something ? 
but if you 're mad at him too and he 's mad at you ... that must make us pals . 
how what , <person> ? 
well , actually , no . well , he 's on the fence . that 's the point . 
that may be . but <person> stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here ! 
what time is it ? 
i do n't like that story . 
good luck , <person> . 
bullshit . you wanted me to kill her . 
i told you ... 
yes . 
i think she 's sweet on him , that 's what i think . 
for real ? 
yes i am . 
i ca n't say . 
yes , hi . 
but i got a train to make . 
oh , thank you . thank you very much . here . 
how are things goin ' out there ? 
then something goes wrong . <person> gets killed . maybe <person> got greedy , killed <person> and left him under his girlfriend 's house . the night he died , <person> was all mysterious . said he had something big going down . 
hey , if everybody 's gon na kill each other , could you do it in another room ? i 'm trying to get something accomplished here . 
wagons , hooaaa ! 
right . i know -- 
remarkable how often those <number> traits coincide . 
sam , do n't -- 
that 's what was estimated . 
... ca n't it wait ? i 'm good for it . ... awright . come out , get the directions from natalie and hurry up .

you need some work , buddy ! 
tough day ? 
oh vada she 's so beautiful . 
oh come on , do n't feel bad . you got played , so what ? you 're new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business <number> day and have all the angles figured out ? 
i do n't know . no . not greer . somebody . 
i said his heart , not his attention . 
that 's a very wise deduction , general . 
i know , but i mean -- not fooling around physically ? ... or not fooling around intellectually ? 
yeah . <person> grazed me . the professor 's under the floor too ... with the overthruster ... 
okay . have you got enough gas to get home , <person> ?

it 's all in lock boxes in a mexico bank . but he 's got a problem . he 's -- what do you call it when you got money , but do n't have cash ? 
the first one . before you where on the island . you liked dinosaurs back then . 
you ca n't go in there , <person> ! you 'll never make it ! 
it did n't work , vince . 
you should n't even think such things ... and you picked a strange person to say them to -- 
i 'm going inside . 
get him in here . 
first of all , we 're locked < u > in < /u > to it , < u > secondly < /u > : 
<person> scott , you forget yourself . please accompany me . 
this is n't a game . 
i know i did . but i do n't . 
i said i 'd move if a cripple came . <person> 's just run in the store and pick out some outfits .

alright , miss ... 
tv repair ? 
<person> was <person> <person> . he owned the estate they lived on ... 
i 'm really sorry but i just arrived ; i 'm on a pretty tight budget myself . i just ca n't afford it . 
well , just promise me you 'll be careful ... alright , alright see ya soon ... good-bye . 
so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck . 
i do not recollect , your majesty . will that be all ? 
looks like you 'd make a good runner . 
that 's a lie , <person> . you 've gone through a lot worse , have n't you ? 
the sound again ? 
i 've been looking for you . <person> <person> was right . <number> of us is a psychotic crusader . 
so , i guess i can go now . 
<person> <person> was in middle management at a refinery ... <person> <person> operated a successful bar and nightclub ... 
and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer . <person> how do you think i realized i love you ? 
oh my god . i 've been so rude . i 'm <person> <person> . has anyone ever told you , you look like <person> <person> ? 
hardly , admiral , i can not even guarantee we will escape the sun 's gravity ! i will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory . 
no ... no stripping ... as the hostess . 
the nerve centers -- the brain -- 
is there a woman ? ... tell me the truth ... there is a woman . 
i 'd better take a look anyway . 
wha ... ? 
please ... 
do n't need it . we 're scattering the ashes . 
yes . he spoke to me . he said i would fight bravely tomorrow . i have never dreamed of merlin before .

how do you say `` come here , baby . i 'm horny . '' i can use that now . 
i know . 
yes , ma'am . but my name is <person> . 
uh-uh . that was a little girl named <person> <person> . that was n't you . 
we ended in f major ? 
why do n't you blow me , chief . after your girlfriend gets through . 
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman ? 
well , now , do n't go creating some artificial environment for yourself . 
ok . 
well , do something , then , damnit ! 
that 's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out . a lot of people are after you , <person> . 
i asked , but ya never helped nothin ' ! -- like the bible sez , ya do n't get no second chance . 
i do n't know . <person> <person> . do me a favor . get me a dna readout on that claw . 
tommy , what happened ? 
thomas . 
progress ! it always arrives too late ! 
do n't think about falling , just keep pedaling . 
no . 
do n't you understand ? the mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events , and changing history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear . 
the answer is never , ted , never . except maybe in your dreams . 
it 's all over between us , <person> , i 'm sorry , but that 's the truth . i 've found someone else , and , it 's very serious and it 's the end . i 'm sorry . it is n't < u > you < /u > , j ... 
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he could n't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the <number> man that could identify him . 
what more proof do you need ? 
big berthas , shelling france . twenty-five-mile range , they have . 
you always overreact , <person> . how terrible can it be ? 
big deal ? if that 's not love , i do n't know what is . 
sex . your sexual history , your sexual preferences .

it 's a detour . they 're backed up for blocks ! 
yes , <number> and a half please . 
i , i , my ears are experiencing a meltdown ! i ca n't hear anything . 
<person> , do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things . 
well , i do n't care if it 's legal or not , we 're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we ca n't even go visit her because she 's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray . 
crunch ... implosion . 
i do n't know . 
you are to turn over the sid <number> program , and all its documentation , for immediate destruction . is that understood ? 
the play ? all right , i guess ... 
why are you afraid ? we 've always been friends . <number> might even say that i brought you up ... is n't it true , <person> ? 
dad , please . 
really ? why ? 
oh , that . i forgot i even said th ...

... you ever get tired ? 
jack ... you get to save the girl and i get my third act ! it 's gon na be good for you and good for me ! 
call the motor pool and authorise personal transport . 
everything 's too hard . maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own , but not now i do n't . 
i flushed it down the toilet . 
am i ? let 's find out . 
why did n't you tell me about this staff meeting ? 
if i am your judge , i can not be your champion . when i act as your king , i can not be your husband .

not to my knowledge , no ... 
i thought you were supposed to keep them . 
how much time do we have ? 
sure . 
do n't give me that . <person> gave it to you yesterday , cash . 
then i love it . 
not a chance . 
that goes for all of you . now eat with your correct hands . 
you better not slow us down , <person> ! 
show me the way ? 
bitch ! 
on your way out , stop at a cigar store , will you , and send me up a couple of cigars ?

i 'll give you <number> % of the door if you do n't play . 
vivian ... 
joanna , go fuck yourself ! 
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors . 
what are you talking about ? 
of course i 'm here . today is the file clerk 's big scene . 
a guy that 'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined . 
for heaven 's sake , joe—stop being an editor for just a minute . we 've been friends for a long time , have n't we ? you ought to know when i 'm serious . this is on the level . 
once the orders have been given , plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft . but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group . 
i do all right . real estate is n't a bad game such as it is around here . the trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it , and overvalue when you sell . you can turn a few dollars that way . 
i do n't know . 
got the information on you ? 
the hospital ? 
just putting in an appearance then . 
he said something about a girl -- 
yeah ... the guy was psycho - i was just tying to protect the girl ... 
i must be going . 
always . always . 
i was going to tell him . 
i thought there might be somebody inside . 
it 's not hopeless ... 
where are you ? you 're driving me crazy , waiting like this . i want you in me now ! 
whatcha watchin ' there ? 
she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent . she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it . 
see if you can find a key for these . try those drawers . it 's a little brass <number> . 
... why do n't you just pay him , <person> ? 
this is n't about `` doing it . '' i just think we need to talk some things out privately before ... 
sure . 
<person> stephanie kill your mother ? 
you see -- the electricity 's been neutralized -- all over the world . 
violet , it 's <person> and <person> . they were in a car accident . 
bobby -- 
with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good . 
allright . <person> here ... 
no . 
i am ? 
then why are you sitting here with half the lights off ? 
the other <number> ? 
naw , it 's ... this guy wants his money . 
no . 
no . no , no . 
i do n't know . but he did die . starks falters under the news . jackie looks around , through her now blurred eyes , like she might find some help in the apartment . she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table , lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink , then laughs nervously as she looks up . 
you 've got it ! 
okay fine . let 's get this over with . 
you 're the killed . 
no , no ...

i know none of < u > my < /u > wives would 've . 
the developing room . i need to ... see you .

hold your breath and we 'll pull . 
i ai n't sayin ' it 's right . i 'm just tellin ' the truth . what was he in the nuthouse for ? 
<person> made his choices , <person> . we all do -- 
yeah ... it 's not ... it 's been on for a bit -- 
i know . funerals . 
i 'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way . 
monsieur le <person> , i am a soldier , not a diplomat . you called this parlay for a reason . 
you 're on duty . keep your fucking mouth shut . go in and get some sleep . 
dr. <person> , who was in the operating room with you ? 
i met this girl . 
not what the records show . <person> , she was a runaway , arrests for vandalism , petty theft , drugs , the whole bit . parole records show she graduated from community college , moved into a retreat house , teaches some classes at the seminary school , has n't been in any trouble since . 
i know , but we ca n't quite figure out how to , y'know , do it . 
nah . i 'll be around , <person> , just back in the field . 
she 's put her life on the line , and her faith in me . 
illusions , <person> ? 
to look ... look for a place ... a place to live in ... an empty place ... a ... new ... place ... 
i told you lay off . 
this afternoon . our boats practically kissed in the harbor . <person> <person> . 
then it 's settled . what time is dinner , <person> ? 
what he was talkin ' about ... how them deputies had the drop on you an ' <person> ... 
what ? assassinate somebody ? 
well , i hope he wins . 
i should n't have put you through that . it must have been agony . let 's do something . 
i did n't see a warrant . did you see a warrant ? 
-- but i did n't feel like getting to know your roaches . 
a <number> and <number> years ago , my ancestors took this island - a barren , lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization . and now that i 'm being forced to give it back , i intend to return it in exactly the same condition : a barren , lifeless rock . the gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless british government who would n't listen . 
to a girl . here . 
well , i still do n't believe i know the man , <person> <person> . now , hold still . 
<person> preysing -- <number> sixty-four . 
brutal day . they say the streets are lined with money down here , but i guess you have to know the secret handshake . what are you drinking ? 
i meant all the choices here . all this -- -- cole slaw , guacamole -- this is some picnic ! 
no ! 
-- it makes the break-in real -- it 's a major goddamn story -- -- i 'm not going to kick ass over this , but i 'd like you to know i hate getting beat , i just hate it -- do n't forget that i hate it -- 
it 's <person> . 
dad !

you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything . 
thank you , but i hardly think -- 
i think you 're a lying , back stabbing bitch . but it 's nice to know you care . 
you know the other day , you asked why i came back ? 
i hate boats . 
well , what <person> you think is gon na be here in this house with a girl ? 
clair , <person> <person> ! what the hell brings you to new canaan ? 
how do you think you got this job , cock ? mmm . i 'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim . 
what ... <person> ... 
after a ways . 
because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... <person> is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had <number> lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she does n't deserve any more - 
i do n't . 
do n't call me that . you know i hate it when you call me that . 
d'artagnan . 
<person> ? 
oh ! my god ! 
pe ? what ? you guys doing gym class ? 
bobby , this is a plumb gig . it 's a bunch of young agents and it 's at a restaurant . it 's gon na be easy and we 'll make a lot of money . 
that 's right . i do n't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth , i do n't give a shit okay ... i just do n't give a shit anymore . 
the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake . but i 've had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we 've got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out . 
the way what is going to be ? 
are you 've seen it work cures ? 
if it were that easy , you would n't find an empty phone booth for the next <number> hours ... 
i was in here yesterday . 
you loser . 
and a fact is a fact . 
there 's no card or anything . 
<person> ! i 'm so glad to see you . i—i was terribly worried . 
we 'll be all right . 
i ... i 'll got to the movies . that 's what i 'll do ! 
could i ? gillis , last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley . so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch . this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax . now if <person> had been elected - 
where 's the dough ? 
yeah , if you have any dimes left . 477- <number> . 
alright . <person> ? 
what 'll it be ? 
no ... you think we can get back with those ? 
-- <person> , call a cab . 
i do n't want to use it . 
i 'm glad you like it , <person> <person> . 
it 's fine , but -- 
you used to work at copper penny ? 
oh , please . i 'm not `` pure of heart . '' 
murderer . 
yeah , he 'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him . 
the damage was considerable . but she 's insured . thanks , again . 
er , ... good . 
release the evil ? 
why ? you gon na do something about it ? 
but that 's a wonderful quality , not a bad quality . have a little patience with her . she 's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard . 
okay . what 's up ? 
<person> cammareri . i think it 's great and about time . what 's she gon na do with the rest of her life she do n't get married ? 
no , ma'am . they ai n't no work hereabouts . <person> 's in tryin ' to sell some stuff to get gas so 's we can get along . 
perhaps . yes ! if we sent a low-level ionic pulse , it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems . 
oh . . . no . . . i mean , we just went dancing . . . for a story . . . 
it 's in your script ... it 's about getting a second chance . <person> ? `` you < u > can < /u > go back ... '' 
i want a .32 . revolver . and a palm gun . that .22 there . 
you 'd better get that blue blood circulating , because we 're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly -- -- <number> minute and twenty seconds . 
yes . 
yeah , well ... i 'm an expert in name- ology . 
no , we created the morlocks . 
everyone knows <person> <person> ... ... except mrs. manny davis . 
i 'm sorry , <person> ' . <person> has been on my back . did you get the money up front like i taught ya ' ? 
and the horse you rode in on . <person> for how long ? ! you ca n't predict this time of year ... 
some people prefer it . 
how 's pilgrim doing ? 
please do n't go . 
what happened at that signing ? 
'cause their apartments might be bugged ? 
tell me - ellen carter forgive me for being so pushy , but are n't you a novelist ? did n't you write that terrific book - 'the color of <person> ' ? 
always . 
yeah , this insurance business is too slow for me . i 'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai . 
your boss , <person> <person> , i understand that cat 's involved in big underground drills . 
so now the confutatis . confutatis maledictis . when the wicked are confounded . <person> acribus addictis . how would you translate that ? 
the blood transfusion continues . <person> has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp , so that he can see <person> in bright light , while he himself sits in the dark . <person> watches <person> 's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death . <person> slowly seems to return to her , and her breathing becomes more peaceful . she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her , but she is much too enfeebled to speak , and closes her eyes again . <person> keeps a close watch on nikolas , who grows paler and paler . his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to <person> again . 
well , seeing as you have so much luck with cars , <person> thought it might be better to bring <number> . he got this guy he says you know from lompoc , <person> something . 
oh , you must n't say things like that . you . . . . . . wait a minute . wait a minute . that 's an idea . what do you think ? yeah , that 'll do it . all right . you 've got your wish . you 've never been born . 
what ? 
oh . 
well , you should n't drink . are you gon na drink ? 
-- and i was wondering if i could buy you a drink or something -- 
potential toxic dump site . 
please ! 
you 'll have to explain that to the police . 
you left <number> phrase out . another educated <person> said to me and i quote : `` <person> <person> oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the negro subculture . '' would you agree ? 
yeah ? 
i think that we should stop going out on dates . 
i know pal . i remember . <number> years tomorrow . 
start at the beginning . page <number> , the first one . here -- 
chicken ! 
it 's fractured ... 
no , i go to a school to learn how to do hair . it 's a government program . but really i want to be a model - and i am definitely not sellin ' . 
why ? 
officer <person> , i 'm glad you 're here . 
no , still here . 
well , you know ... 
i 'm not going to marry him . i just went out with him once . i know ! why do n't we go to the movies tonight . just us girls . it 'll be fun . 
no , we have to get this story . 
but this is class kid , all the way . what a way to go . 
anything else ? 
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship . the ship sinks . 
but i 'm just trying to leave . 
we work fast enough for you ? 
captain ... 'this kid ' is a prisoner of war . 
is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers , that the bureau , the rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally ? 
nothing . 
so shut up and keep painting.. 
howard the jerk reneged on me . i 've got to cover his loss to the tune of about <number> grand ! i 'm tapped out man , american express got a hit man looking for me . 
i 'm just saying , i know what it 's like to lose something you love . to see it slip away , and know it 's never coming back . 
you expect me to believe that ? 
i 'll say . 
well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed . you see , the velocity -- 
let me comfort you . 
well at least talk it up , then . i feel like an idiot . 
go for a walk in central park -- 
but how do you know if the people are guilty ? 
okay , i guess . 
a gull smashed into <person> 's front door . <person> ... what 's happening ? 
no . 
i dunno . 
what 's the matter ? upset that i rubbed off on her ? 
good to meet you . 
you seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand ! <person> , the republic is dead . you think those senators could govern ? for the last hundred and fifty years they 've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses ! 
everything . <person> at the beginning . 
not sure . let me think about it . 
maybe you 'd like to tell <person> and dad why you stopped taking your medication . 
<person> , but it 's out of my hands . try again next year . 
bon voyage . 
i do , i do . i 'm sure i 'm just ... how was your day ? 
i do n't know what to say 
being gale weathers . what the hell are you doing ? 
but i ... we do n't even know each other . 
spend as much time as possible with <person> before she leaves . 
i need your help . in order to fight <person> , i must wear the armor of achilles . i -- 
in a way -- this girl , thea . you must stay away from her . 
oh , <person> , i am so disappointed in you . you must n't look at those horrible things , they degrade the human image . 
enough for drinks , popcorn and candy ! 
you hated west more than any of us . 
all right , i did , but i was in a weird place then . 
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ? 
i think i 'll take them . 
i 'm a what ? 
let 's let <person> open <number> . 
no ... 
yes ? 
i 'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child ? 
aye -- yet <number> such as i who has wandered this world for nearly <number> centuries can remember back to other days of change . days of <person> of the hood and <person> <person> . they were real enough once , but they drifted into men 's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do <number> day . 
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together . 
no . 
yo , we might have killed him . you think ? 
what ? 
are you learning how to play it ? 
they 're hauling <person> into court . 
half the house ! you 'll never see a penny . i want it here , in my hand . 
do n't forget anchovies . 
well , i think you do . 
i 'm replacing you as captain of the enterprise . 
that you do n't have what it takes to be acitizen ! 
that 's right , just me . 
you were at the opera ? well , that explains -- yes i was there . i was there with <person> . 
that was her sister -- the wicked witch of the east . this is the wicked witch of the west . and she 's worse than the other one was . 
the terms are too high . unconditional surrender . 
i know . <number> went home . we offered them refunds . 
yeah ? 
me too . 
anastasia 's grandmother is in paris . we 're going to bring anastasia to her - in paris . 
yes . i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress . 
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot , did n't he ? 
palm apodaca . 
why me ? 
he hates me . 
that 's the past . it 's dead . 
we have no right to do this . they deserve to know . 
for <person> 's sake , mrs. <person> , here we are , you 've got me into your house . you give me a drink . you put on music , now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband wo n't be home for hours . 
<person> 's right , captain . he 's got to be forced into making a mistake . 
the season is a long way off , <person> <person> , and by that time , <person> oughta be home . if he ai n't , believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops . we have to because we owe you all that money -- <person> <person> . 
is <person> <person> there ? 
what ? but i saw 'em- 
photographs - compromising stuff . and he 'll use 'em . the agency plays for keeps ... i knew <person> . he was in my civil air patrol unit . i taught him everything . a `` wan na be , '' y'know , nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch . i treated him good . he 'd talk about his kid , y'know , really wanted her to grow up with a chance , but ... he got a raw deal . the agency fucked him . just like they 're gon na fuck me . 
i 'll start by following the shoreline . and my nose . 
mind if you tell me what 's goin ' on ? 
it 's just a summer job . something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation . 
i thought she was splendid ! 
... to what ? incinerate ? 'cuz i 'm almost dead certain there 's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory ! some shit , suffice it to say , just do n't wash out . now , the money question ... to whom does that stain belong ? 
you spit on me ! 
you want us to give you cash right now ? 
lets get things nice and sparkling clear . this sarcasm , if i may call it such , does not become you , o my brothers . as i am your droog and leader , i am entitled to know what goes on , eh ? now then , <person> , what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend ? 
but of course ... 
just for now . 
because we are n't ready yet for the french . before attacking , we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge . of course , there is the casbah . but even the casbah is n't safe yet . there are too many drunks , pushers , whores , addicts , spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves , undecided people . we must either convince them or eliminate them . we must think of ourselves first . we must clean out the casbah first . only then will we be able to deal with the french . do you understand , <person> ? 
nothing . it 's nothing . 
what you do n't want to imagine is the things i 've done . 
number one . you have the bridge . 
i ca n't help it . i 'm just weak , i guess . 
let me tell you what i know , <person> . you went to <person> <person> with <person> . you lived <number> blocks from her . you liked her . but she ai n't interested . that must 've hurt , huh ? 
are n't you listening , man ? love gives you wings . 
relax , <person> . he had the shoe and the shoe checks out . 
and what ? 
<number> west ninth street . 
in rome , i 'll bow . 
they 're screaming for starbursts . 
maybe older -- 
int . gomez 's helicopter - day . 
naw , baby , no lovin ' tonight . 
my husband is a proud man , sir . he would be furious if he knew i 'd come . 
at night . he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . i heard him . my <person> told me he had a hunnert <number> dollars down there . maybe more . 
he 's another ivy leaguer so he 'll probably expect you to be understanding -- might surprise him if you 're not . 
yeah , no duh . 
i used to worry ... but you know what happens , you find out that scuba diving 's safer than climbing into the bathtub ... . 
to lunch , you say . i am having coffee and sandwiches sent in . we are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening . 
i came up here after <person> 's father died . they were very supportive and helped me adjust . i got myself together . i 've gotten myself together now , too . 
i loved your chemist , jake . the height of fantasy . and your vision of paradise . a most romantic creation . you 're quite a dreamer , jake . only it 's time to wake up . 
hmmmm . . . 
we 're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we 'll dine at ernie 's first . <person> is easier ? 
it 's not <person> . it 's a movie . 
yes ... sometimes you have to give them candy . 
on tv . 
heart attack . apparently they brought a couple hookers along . 
so , we 're all old friends of <person> 's . we go way back to our childhood . 
who ? 
by the way , <person> , last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte . 
yes , <person> ? 
yeah . your parents came to my funeral . i was surprised at how many people came . 
you bet i left him , took the dog and we was history . 
yeah ... 
should i be ? 
we had <person> <person> hats , but you could < u > crush < /u > 'em ... you could < u > crush < /u > 'em , see , when you felt stupid . crush'em , put em in your pocket . you ca n't put a mountie hat in your ... 
i 'm not the police . i do n't care about experimentation . she 's a kid . i 'm worried to death . 
how are you , <person> ? 
yes ! you said it , <person> . that 's the only thing that means anything to me . 
it would be honor , brock . now let 's go get this guy ... 
i 'll tell you what , <person> . it 's because i ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood . it 's because you were afraid to face it -- and you 're still afraid . 
he 's fine . <person> <person> , let 's go . you guys stay here . 
i think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation . 
i would never barf in your urn , brenda . maybe l.b . did it . 
no , a major , were you really ? 
long story . his goons will be here any minute . we 've got to get you out of here <number> now ! 
that 's not a laugh ! i mean a laugh from the heart . now let 's see . i 'm going to tell you a funny story . just a moment ... i 've got it ! well , it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america ... 
is it true ? 
can i please have a cup of coffee ? 
does n't say -- it 's just these pages . 
you 're welcome . <person> <person> . 
<person> lois lane , i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because i 'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls . it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior 's attentions . 
and we did n't have to bring another present ? 
that 's amazing . what are you ? some sort of angel visiting me from <number> of my drunk fantasies ? how can you be so good ? 
norville ! 
aye , lad ... we 've little else to go by . 
look , the other night , i want to apologize . 
what you talkin ' about , <person> ? we 're together , you and me , just like always . now the thing we got ta work out is how to get <person> outa there and then the terrible trio be all complete again . man , this old free world ai n't gon na know which ear to stand on . 
<person> <person> died . 
i did n't say nothin ' , boss . 
where am i to go , <person> ? 
oh , <person> ! you want to be a martyr or a hero or what ? 
like what ? 
<person> christ , <person> . 
she was happy here . however the <number> of you might have parted . do n't think she was n't . 
well who did ? 
then what ? 
the truth is for suckers , johnny-boy . 
not me . i 'm equipped . 
i 'll get it , sit down , <person> <person> . do you want a sweater or something ? a quilt ? 
<person> was running his camp north of <person> <person> . <person> handled a lot of the training . there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba . a few americans got trained , too . nazi types . mercenaries . but <person> was the craziest . 
how do we start ? 
ah . where ? 
sure . 
no thanks . 
yes , there 's no time to spare . and those fibers can be quite tenacious . 
the happy hunting ground . who cares ? 
this is <number> charming crook . if shooting people is charming . 
ok. well ... make us proud . and be careful . 
do n't they have enough for you to do at the castle ? 
son-of-a-bitch ... my nose ... this fuck-up is interfering with- 
and you dreamed about what was up there . about ... 
of course it is . and i 'm gon na stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing , that real lives are gon na be lost . maybe mine , maybe yours . 
that 's wonderful . i think you should ... fresh air . 
hey , <person> . glad you 're here . there was something i wanted to tell you ... 
i 'm fine . 
never better . 
next time . <person> , i want to share the most beautiful thing i could possibly imagine . 
finish your breakfast ... 
you 're not the only one . 
will you men help us stop the french ? 
i did . 
yeah , you 're right . but i never claimed to know everything like you , and have all these little theories . i 'm still learning , i know that . but i do n't feel like i 've wasted time . if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now , fine . 
so what are you saying ? 
no good ... they might block off the old chip . this way . 
... why did she do it , ruth ? why ? 
it 'll be my last chance . pleese ? 
it does n't matter . what matters is i 've got a roomful of guests down there , who think i 'm a fraud . i am going to teach you something here lydia . you 've < u > got < /u > to take the right tone in things like this , or people -- whether they 're dead or alive -- people will walk all < u > over < /u > you . come on out , or i will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never < u > lived < /u > ! 
have you been in ? 
if you love her , you must do what she asks . 
tell me it 's not a mirage . 
what ? 
what ? you 've got ta be kidding ! 
i 'm sorry , sergeant major . there was n't anything i could do . <person> gets crazy -- 
go back to china , bitch ! 
oh ... we split up . 
what ? 
look , you did something that set it off . try to remember . concentrate . tell me exactly what you did ! ! 
i do n't know , sir . <person> made the arrangements . 
i am afraid , then , i have to ask you both , <person> as my brother , and <person> as my good friend , whether or not you know anything about this , or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it . 
but try too hard -- 
oh . well , thank you ! how wonderful . some people get all the luck . 
do you always have to call him that ? the suit ? it makes you sound like such a hick . his name is <person> . 
she told me . 
a week , <number> , <number> days – 
you mean in signs ? 
i 've never seen a lobster . 

how old 's <person> ? 
anything . 
wrong again -- but i dislike possessive women . 
you seem pretty sure of that . 
i thought i was your boyfriend . 
who said i was depressed ? 
where did you get the news item ? from a little bird ? 
oh , it 's open . 
<person> offered to stake me . 
fuck me ... 
how did you manage it ? 
done . 
implicitly . 
i 'm lookout . 
i think i 'm floating . 
you 're calling me on your cell phone , right ? 
right . 
what do you want me to do ? 
`` dear , you 're lovely . '' `` strap her to the table . '' 
<person> avi 's a zionist nazi . 
come in , <person> , this is your office , too . <person> , this is lieutenant <person> <person> . 
or ... ... she gave it to somebody else first , before <person> went in the dressing room . 
never mind the condition of your body and your spirit ! look after your things , your things ! 
so you haven ’ t seen the film , then ? 
i do n't know . 
it 's coming ... argh ! i ca n't ! 
i do n't want to talk about it . if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed , auggie , and it never gave me nothing but grief . 
we do n't . 
does that mean we ca n't ... 
now , you 're too suspicious . 
think . 
nice guy eddie . 
you 've read it a hundred times . 
hmm ? 
look ... you made a very calculated move , and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you . that was n't necessary . 
how can you , how can you say that ? 
take a look . 
... because i feel it . 
thanks very much . 
he could have killed him ! okay ? he could have killed him . 
that 's what i 'm telling you , baby . the babies love that stuff . they do n't want all that sensitive shit . you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream . they know what you want . what do you think ? you think they do n't ? 
we do n't know . 
oww ... man ... 
that was easy , was n't it ? 
why , how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ? 
i do suppose so . but if you were there yesterday , guess you can get there today . 
no , i like the bag . it would be good for the job tonight . 
unless what ? 
as much as <person> 's ? 
we grow most of our own food . the money i get from social security , my pension and my wife 's work , keeps us living on the edge . what choice do people like us have . 
do you know who <person> <person> is ? 
he spoke to you ? 
she moved out ? 
i want to come back and stay here . 
yes , you can . you can spoil a perfectly nice dance . 
my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs . 
yes . 
down there on the flats , eh ? listen up , <person> ! our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet ... 
the shark will get it for us . 
the way you were looking at me , i just went . 
i 'll sign that affidavit . 
spec-recon . those guys are world- class warriors . and they will not want you there , jordan . 
you saw it ? 
i do n't mean now . i mean before -- before we met . 
we 're leaving -- case dismissed for lack of evidence . maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we 're going to graduate with no thesis . 
well , yeah . but you got ta start making some choices . 
all over the ship ; we 'll have to check the charts to know for sure . 
yeah , well , perhaps ... speaking of which : i have a < u > prescription < /u > here , i 'm going to give you the < u > number < /u > , i need you standing by with a < u > crate < /u > of the stuff ... . it 's ... what is it ? 
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . <person> <person> says ... 
fired ! you 're fired ! is that plain enough for you , buster ! 
mrs. holland must have been beautiful -- - 
turn this way . no , no ... not you ... you ! 
i told you what they said . 
i have to . i ’ m the best man . 
what they like then ? 
yeah , hey , why do n't yuh try it on ? 
romance ! 
close quarters combat . <person> <number> in my own home . 
compensated ... ? 
i did n't do it ! 
you phoned up <person> <person> 's wife ? 
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat . drinking whiskey , chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses . want to know what it 's really like ? it 's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for <number> days straight , pissing in a plastic bottle , pardon me , because some guy thinks his wife 's cheating on him . <person> , huh ? and the guy who hired you , he has a hair-lip , dandruff and crooked teeth , and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife 's cheating , and you do n't blame her . 
how 'you gon na live ? 
i had this whole thing in my head , i was gon na be able to get this to you today -- i have to leave today -- 
that 'll - it 'd be a first ; man and dinosaur all die together . <person> 's plan . 
i am not sure . only time will answer . <person> . i thank you . what you have done is -- 
yeah . 
well , when we rejuvenate this <number> you can ask her . 
do n't worry about it . you want anything ? 
dr. grant ! dr. grant ! 
if i could have a blade , then i would be please to run with you . 
well , you did ! <person> found out and he 's nuts . it took everything i could do to keep him from coming here and killing you . you have to stop this stuff , <person> . 
i 've been thinking about that since you brought it up before . 
`` my president '' ... 
yeah . yeah we get along well . you did n't get along with her very well ? 
well , i do n't record negro songs . i 'm lookin ' for some ol'-timey material . why , people just ca n't get enough of it since we started broadcastin ' the 'pappy o'daniel flour hour ' , so thanks for stoppin ' by , but- 
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like ? 
where ? 
how old is she ? 
no she did n't ... 
oh , i understand , all right . i 've been understanding since i was seventeen . and the next step is , as long as you 're going to see me tomorrow , why do n't you stay the night . 
bullshit politics . 
you gon na drive out there ? 
but that 's living like an animal— 
i do n't want to see ! 
alright . 
i think that if i 'm old enough to accept a new baby , and if i 'm old enough to accept a new room , i 'm old enough to go to california . 
nothing lasts . 
really ? 
<person> ' too showy ! 
how is he ? 
the moon is too round of face , methinks . 
do n't worry , <person> . you 'll be all right . i seen enough to know . 
ok , get in . 
like moths around the candle of the age . decadent , useless . they ca n't reflect anything . but you do . you reflect its broken heart . 
maybe . i do n't know . he has not asked my advice . if he asks my advice , i do n't know what i will say . 
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun would n't work , so -- 
i do n't know , it 's strange ... it 's not the best career path , but when you get the bug , there 's nothing you can do about it . see , when you beat <number> of these things ... 
<person> 's all banged-up . he made a stupid play ... he 'll limp around the yard up at folsom . but <person> will be there to take care of him . with their priors , they 're looking at a serious bounce -- 
only if you 'll tell me who he is . 
i can save you the trouble . you 're nutty as a fruitcake . i love you anyway . 
a toy ? 
i know this sounds insane ellen , but ... telling you all of this , writing the book ... it feels good . do n't get me wrong - i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders ... when i tell you what i have done - i ca n't believe it is me ... yet i know it was . this is like a purging for me ... 
what exactly is the treatment here going to be then ? 
i 'll be asking the questions . last night , you hear anything unusual ? <person> ? shouts ? 
what museum ? 
spit from your dad ? 
fill 'er up . 
yes , it is . 
you know ! you 've got the brain of a pancake ! that was n't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution ! <person> ! this is the greatest yarn in journalism since <person> discovered <person> for the new york herald ! 
i suppose i could phone the store in the morning , and say i 'm sick . 
how do you define it ? 
it 's my control board and i do n't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard , no put the shit away . 
well , life 's not fair . we know that . 
he 's company . 
it 's nothing . a stupid party . not really a night club , it 's , uh ... 
i ... given the limits of your question , that 's correct . 
how 'd you know i was here ? 
yes , it 's a miracle . 
why , <person> , you 're insane— 
there 's no time . 
put the girl on . 
i ai n't got nothing against god . it 's the people he let come into the world ... lot of them should have been stopped at the door . what are you looking for ? 
well , we ca n't force her . it 's her decision . 
of course it is . 
i do n't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before . 
who ? people , that 's who ! pretty soon there wo n't be room for anyone . they 're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine . oofh ! crap ! i believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it . 
that 's exactly what i am doing , again . 
not with this disk . i 'm going to check on the beam connection , <person> . you <number> can keep a watch out for grid bugs . 
what do you make of this ? 
better than old times . 
in other words , we collectively do n't know shit . 
in the physical sense . 
just let me rest for a second . 
he was tough . you did all you could . 
yah , but it 's better than this shit . at least you 'd make some nice bank . 
an interview ! do you know what they will do to us ... ! i thought ... <person> . 
we 're down to <number> minutes <number> seconds.. 
i love you , too . 
jack , it 's a sitcom -- you 're not defining pi . 
i have some sandwich fixings if you 're hungry . 
yeah , okay . 
i 'd have liked to talk to him . 
<person> let his wife kill herself ! <person> ended up in an institution - ! * 
what about you ? 
the fucking new york times . 
you were hoping for a kind word ? ! you 're my mother ! you 're supposed to nourish me ! support me ! 
you said do n't do it , boss . 
uh..you 're welcome . 
it 's no good going berserk against a dragon ! 
oh . 
are you crazy ? you 'll get caught . 
this guy 's dangerous , let 's think of something else . 
why ? 
i do n't think i like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl ! 
and ? 
i do n't know why ... why now ? 
we need another <number> . 
of course . 
there 's an empty taxi across the street . if you 're so anxious , take it . he 'll know the way to the police headquarters . 
if you do n't - can you still afford to go to <person> ? 
everything 's kosher . <person> him for me . 
thanks . 
but dr. <person> said you were around when my father was ... 
me ? - if i 'm worried about anyone , it 's you . what happened to you , <person> ? you were the brightest of us - 
now ... i don ’ t ... 
i 've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died . sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here . my mama 's real good , but i wish i had both of 'em . when we went to <person> <number> time in the car , it was rainin ' so hard we could n't see the road . but i wad n't scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin ' nothin ' could happen to us . i feel that way about mama now . <person> has a boyfriend now . his name is doyle hargraves . he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin ' . he still do n't help mama out with any money though . he ai n't no good . he 's mean to her . he do n't like me at all . <person> says it 's because he 's jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him . he stays with us all night sometimes , but he 's got his own house . <person> told me it 's so he can still have other girlfriends . i like it on the nights when he ai n't at our house . i 'm not so nervous then . 
well , remember , its leathery magee up ahead in that convertible , so cover me in the stake-out . 
no . 
i thought you might -- i do n't know -- swallow your tongue or something . i guess you really miss her , huh ? 
i lied . 
okay , i guess . it 's so intimidating . you know being away from home , not knowing anyone . i feel like such a geek sometimes . everyone 's so cool and i 'm so not . 
no , she did n't <person> . but i think you should do the scene . 
no way . 
that 's all right . what are you going to do about emily ? 
why should i mind ? 
you bet . 
no , sir . this is my own idea . 
lotta water . 
go home . 
i 'm not entirely certain , captain . you 'll have to see for yourself . 
with respect , <person> , many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes . maybe he 's just unlucky . 
he does n't want my help . 
mad like a dog in heat , i bet you were . i can tell you got a temper on you . 
i , uh ... 
there was an unavoidable delay . 
and look what you 've done to <person> <person> ! 
yeah ? 
think this about money still , ya old fool ? 
dr. drumlin , we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity . there are over <number> hundred <number> stars out there -- 
before the coma ! 
... until our wedding night . when our bodies will join . 
do n't you think you 'd like to go back to detecting once in a while , just for the fun of it ? 
i 'm really sorry ! 
<person> <person> came . 
all i 'm saying is that amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars , and if they ca n't swim here , they 'll use the beaches at cape cod , or long island . 
[ no . not by the rules of polite society at least . ] 
thank you . 
you do n't know shit ! 
[ i should start going for your tits first . ] 
get real , that would make me a suspect ! 
but it 's a nightmare ! <person> <person> is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture ! 
yes you are . i 'm not just some reporter . i do n't just stick a microphone in your face . you could give me something . 
clayton is fine . 
no shooting . 
yeah . 
to begin with , your methods of dating the past are crude , to say the least . there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations . 
no ... what about your sister ? 
how long can you go without sleep ? 
there 's nothing to see . i used to live here , you know . 
<person> blew up the hindenburg . he 'll blow me up , that 's what she said ... 
what do you mean ? 
hey , these guys are professionals . they 're the best . c'mon , they 're not lying down on the job . 
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion . 
i 'm colonel brynner , u.s. special operations com- ... 
no , she hates me ... i want to end everything here ... now . 
oh ! 
then your toes belong on the other side of it ! ! ! 
yes , and he has a choice ! 
i do n't , really . i was referred to him . 
well , i 'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late -- 
so i guess you did n't get away * for the weekend after all ? * 
i better just go in and see her . 
you know , <person> , <person> <person> was fought because of a bet <person> <person> lost to <person> <person> . 
you got that on the brain , <person> . if you 're so scared of 'em why 'd you take their money to vegas to begin with ? 
-- and now you 're going to pee some more . 
are n't we all ? 
mama mia . just because you were a nerd once does n't mean it 's going to happen again . that 's why you have me for fashion consultation . 
i know what you 're up to . 
to urbana . it 's a hundred miles . 
is n't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle ? 
yeah , you know . suffers from <number> of these complexes they have nowadays . <person> pretty obvious , does n't it ? she 's probably very unattractive and bitter about it . 
very well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him ! 
<person> , we 're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there . 
it says she was originally <person> rigged , but <person> <person> turned her into a brigantine . i think square rigs look so much more romantic . 
i 've never `` been there ... when we met it was in his office . 
i di n't solve it , i did n't ' < u > solve it < /u > ' . i just sat a < u > dance < /u > out with him . facts , facts , facts . < u > facts < /u > , close the case , cavalier . 
you were unhappy ? 
i 'd like that . 
oh , but you do n't know how big this thing is . you should see the thousands of telegrams we 've received and what they 're saying about you . 
i like a place with lots of life . 
you know her ? 
where is it ? 
you , <person> , <person> . 
i 'm hungry too . we got ta get some food after this . 
huh ? oh . another <number> , huh ? shit , i guess i 'm clean out of receptacles . 
last time you did n't even scratch it ! 
do n't talk . do n't talk ! 
you do n't need a key . 
well -- it 's high and it 's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it 's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new states growing in the west . 
then do me a favor and get rid of her . if not for me , then do it for you . look at yourself . you 're a joke . she 's turned you into jelly . what do you want to be , <number> of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling . people used to respect you . they feared you and now you 're going to throw that all away . 
<person> <person> <person> . 
i 've got a pretty good idea . you 're here to kill me , so kill me . you want me to be afraid , but i 'm not . i do n't care who you are , or why you <number> killed my husband ... 
normal . what 's normal ? does normal exist ? and if it did , how would we know it ? 
we do . 
turn over your weapon , <person> ! 
this 'll be our first . we 've been waiting a long time . 
<person> <person> ... . 
i do n't know ... 
am i s'posed to be grateful ? 
who 's she gon na marry ? 
yeah , i know <person> <person> gets married . <person> closed . <person> . <person> , if you could live your life over again , would you do the same thing ? <person> married and settle down after high school ? 
i should start . 
you < u > were < /u > ? 
naw , he ai n't home right now . 
we 're going to get off , all right . we 'll get you off of there . just ... be cool . 
what is it , <person> ? 
that 's right , captain . just passin ' the time . 
sudden flashes of light . 
you do n't know what you want . 
i was . what are you reading ? 
you have your intrigues . i have mine . this is a happy day for me , <person> . nine months from today , i will be in medellin sipping champagne . in <number> months , i am free . how much time do you have ? 
do n't worry about dr. dreyfuss -- i happen to know he was out on a case . 
you know , <person> . i 've finally figured it out . it 's not sex i want . anyone can have sex . 
they 're not my children . 
so you 're telling me it was <number> guy with <number> guns ? a-and he was a senior fucking citizen ? 
hey , why do n't you go to the movie ? your mother and me , we 're gon na be baby-sitter . 
emily ! 
i do n't wan na stick out my tongue . 
mh-hm . 
but , <person> , the window of the < u > firehut < /u > ... 
he thinks you betray him with <person> . <person> ! the waters deceive you ! 
long suspected of running the tangiers without ... 
crow . i 'm not gon na kill you . 
my father used to have a saying , <person> -- `` god sees the truth , but waits . '' 
yeah , man , male , significant other , whatever the fuck i am . 
but sir ! federation starship approaching . 
he could 've monitored the calls on a scanner . did you call her from the set ? 
thelma ! i 'm not gon na talk about this ! now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will ! you understand ? 
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest . 
<person> , son . <person> . 
the <number> danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might - we can not predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space . i can not say i am glad you asked me that - 
it was no time to lose my partner . we 're going to have to hurry , he 's on to us . 
how many ? 
out of the question <person> , coming here will not change the - 
i was deniro ! 
i was the , i was ... you know , it was my fault . i -- 
i 'll tell you what , fella -- you want t ' find me , you jus ' turn <number> -- from now on i 'll be right behind you . 
you come with me - you stay here . 
i 'm ready to make you another deal . 
yes , it was ... very nice ... thank you . 
we 're gon na use them for demonstration footage . 
they 're empty , dr. weir . moving forward . 
as obvious as that ? our security people will jump for joy . i suppose <person> 's onto me , too ? 
to the manner born . 
but you can breathe it . 
i know . now shut it . you say a fucking word the right knee goes , another word then your left . 
<person> got a little tipsy is all . he does n't handle pressure well . it 's over . 
but ... i am a green man . i have no title , nor lands ... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body . 
oh man ... i do n't know . i 'm gon na miss being disreputable . 
i just need to talk . 
sure . why ? 
brian , he 's coming around ! 
great , thanks for the tip . 
after we eat , dad . 
no , <person> . 
do n't change the subject ! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself . 
god , even < i > you < /i > want to tell me what i < i > ca n't < /i > do . in case you had n't noticed , <person> , i do n't need rescuing . but < i > you < /i > did , once . 
what ? 
i will not . 
it 's very good , indeed . 
what do you want from me ? 
i know , i know . 
but i have to go , dear . it 's a very important banker 's meeting . 
hi . 
liz we 've got to cancel , we have to put it off . 
it 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father . ultimately , it 'll lead to her suicide . nice work , daddy . 
bad news from america . your brother , santino . he has been killed . 
my lawyer ? why do i need a lawyer ? 
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night ? 
and destroy every planet in the system . 
yes . 
you can change it if you want to . 
yes , i love you . i 've told you , but it does n't really matter . 
<person> president we can not allow federation citizens to be abducted . 
and everybody , all the time . yeah , it 's a chore . 
he tells me he can give us an exit visa , but we have no money . 
oh , you do ? with all your legal expertise , you believe that ? 
no , sir ... 
and it 's horrible too . i 'm sorry jeffrey . that 's the way it has to be . <person> . i 'm sure you do understand . 
maybe all she needs is some company . 
i know . h-how much do you need ? 
fuck sides ! what we need is a little solidarity here . somebody 's stickin ' a red hot poker up our asses and we got ta find out whose hand 's on the handle . now i know i 'm no piece of shit ... and i 'm pretty sure you 're a good boy ... and i 'm fuckin positive you 're on the level . so let 's figure out who 's the bad guy . 
<number> thirty . 
that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you 've been over-tenderizing your meat , again . 
but she must know ... unless ... unless ... <person> , was there more than <number> person ? 
<person> costello . that 's my maiden name . 
art thou not <person> and a montague ? 
yeah ? 
mmm-hmm ... and your boy very well mighta been <number> of 'em . 
my name is <person> <person> . we went to college together . 
who gives a shit ! i did n't come here to listen to music ! listen up instead of running off at the mouth ! the batteries on my phone are almost gone . 
then why do n't you leave ? just give me <number> good reason . 
well , i mean ... you know , i got ta ask you . that 's a lot of money . you 're not asking for a box of popcorn , you know . i mean ... 
that i am ... 
i am only insinuating that you are nervous . 
-- you do n't understand , they 'll make the connection , they 'll hoover again . we should cut our losses . 
not an easy day to forget . 
yo , <person> . we got us some kind of < u > ventriloquist < /u > here . 
you should go out every now and then , gus ; with some new ties the girls would be all over you . 
god ! unbelievable . vampires . 
no ... thank you ! ... i 'll be bringin ' the `` caddy '' by tomorrow . 
your bed ? 
i know . thanks . just do n't tell anyone i have a soft side . 
good lad . 
hey , wait a minute . when am i going to see you again ? 
it 's tough to find a good job without any kind of training . 
i 'm sorry , but i do n't seem to recall the occasion . no , i 'm afraid ... 
not for you . okay , there 's lots more . 
ya got that right . 
your heart . 
who are you trying to reach ? 
no , but she does , and that 's all that matters . 
it 's a toss-up , i can tell you that . 
i 'm <person> <person> . i 'm the producer . 
<person> <number> as shot <person> <person> in lake county ? 
course i ca n't . i 'll give you a lift to the first ranch . 
but he just never troubled to have you get any schooling ? 
hm . 
then on behalf of my weiner , i 'd like to ask for an advance . 
you would n't understand . we genetically engineered the morlock class to serve our needs . 
what else did she tell you ? 
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before . as an android , i am in complete control of my neural net . the information contained there can not be forcibly removed . 
the same thing -- his business pressures , the whole move and everything . he 's frantic about nailing this new job , worried about screwing over his present boss . 
what ? 
yes , sir . like you to meet <person> . 
i do n't need you to `` stick . '' 
why ? you got money from <person> ' insurance with the school board . we all did . 
why ? 
oh . <person> . well , so long . enjoy your visit . 
mmm . 
sally ? 
sirs : our theories have a bearing on his identity . 
a debate . <person> 's inhumanity to woman . he 's pro women . i 'm con . ms. flannery is twisted . 
i believe in miracles now . 
um ... do you people scream right when you ... you know . 
no idea . 
-- i guarantee she wo n't gain an once . she 's very disciplined . 
what ? 
yes . 
that 's okay . i wanted to talk to you . 
an american . 
`` you lose some of the time , what you always go afta , but you lose all the time what you do n't go afta ! '' 
not ... totally . 
`` i die knowing no <number> knew the real me . '' 
oh . no . 
ayuh . 
i mean as long as she 's not a complete imbecile and she 's even remotely attractive ... 
i just got a call ... <number> seconds ago , some motherfucker called ... says he knows about the loop . 
vivian 's in sales . 
mm ... oh , man ... 
what ? 
gentlemen , needless to say , there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations . good night . 
that 's confidential information , little man . 
you 're not . we 're level . look at the instruments , we 're okay ! 
you 're lovelier this morning than you have ever been . 
what ? no . this is my mother 's house . i do n't live with my mother . i just stop by , help out . i 'm good like that . 
we 're police officers . 
oh shit . 
he was a child killer in the late sixties ... in a town called springwood about <number> miles from here . guess what his murder weapon was ? a glove with six-inch blades . 
i 'm searching for patterns in the noise , that 's all . order in the chaos . i 'm practicing listening -- 
they 're bound to try again . no wonder they want me to stand by during the operation . 
i imagine that 's very important . especially during the moulting season . 
bullet proof vests do n't bleed . 
we 'll discuss it later . 
oh . 
that 's confidential . could you put the money on the dresser ? 
you sure ? you look pretty shaky ... 
i do n't love him . i love <person> . 
jesus , she 's my best friend . 
everyone else was wrong and the <number> fucking lunatic was right ! 
bet you are . 
she 's not a tart . 
what are you going to do ? drink it ? 
a little family emergency -- 
you have n't heard my offer . 
the left , i think . those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody 's even broken yet . 
i know absolutely nothing of war -- and i am still totally dependent upon my generals . 
he is , i believe , a brother . 
no , but you 're welcome to a free beer before you go . 
anybody ! er , er—beany 'll do ! 
not the way i did it . i was loaded half the time . i do n't know how you could change bedpans sober . i used to hang out with this guy , <person> . he was an x-ray technician or something . 
i 'm proud of you , <person> . 
he tried to kill me ! 
you try and have a good time . 
irish m -- what the fuck are you talking about ? my name 's da fino ! i 'm a private snoop ! like you , man ! 
nobody sent me . i came on my own . 
fifteen for me . 
for dinner . unless i call and tell them we 're still in new hampshire . 
oh ... ... ... ... 
see , i knew you 'd be mad . 
uh-huh . 
delia will cook ... 
and what 's that ? 
what about you ? 
i do n't know . but it 's something alien . 
exactly . this is our little secret , partner . 
and live on your salary , i suppose ? 
it 's got a green dot on its back . i ca n't go to sleep with it watching me . 
thank you very much . 
like what ? 
you 're leaving ? 
you 're kidding yourself . 
why begrudge me a little fun ? i just want you to look nice , my stray little boy . 
`` u.s.a. is a-okay . '' 
thank you , concerned citizen . 
always am . 
so how come i love you most when you stick your finger in your chin ... ? 
trouble with the car again ? 
i 'm going back . 
i have no idea . 
i think you forgot this . hands him his wallet and badge ... 
i saw the sign . 
it bodes evil . 
and then what , <person> ? we 'd be back to where we were <number> years ago . you 're talking like a teenager . 
the <number> about the siberian bloodhound ? 
good evening , <person> <person> . what can i do for you ? 
my shrink says he 's not so bad . 
no sir ... i just wanted to know if you needed a hand ? 
you already have staked your reputation . mayor <person> and i have been friends a long time . since <person> tried to kill him , it does n't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that <person> <number> might go after him , too . <person> 's re-election rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with <number> psychotic on the loose . the fail-safe on—line , yet ? 
sure . no problem . 
we 'll kill <person> this year . 
who 's your partner ? 
we came to see <person> <person> . 
why do n't we start with that next week ? 
they know , but they focused on the burglary -- if it did n't deal with the break-in , they did n't pursue it . 
you 're crawling around like a -- 
it 's always been a good persuader . 
to warn him . 
where are my cigarettes ? 
and did n't <person> <person> come home <number> day and find you in bed with your male lover ? 
bridgework ? 
`` my dear '' ... 
none , it 's mine - you said it earlier , i 'm nuts . 
go on then ! pa 's in the barn saddlin ' the fort worth stud ... an ' you can take the light gelding with the blaze ... 
our troops have no part in this . it has been started by the russians ! 
because i died in episode <number> ! 
what are you talking about ? killing 's totally natural . it 's dying that is n't natural ... 
it is tomorrow . <number> a.m. how come you 're so late ? 
a lot of people . teachers . younger kids . it 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason . but that 's ok ... because i know i deserve it . 
he 'd been shot . i did n't know that . he just crawled into the back seat , said `` west 45th street '' and conked out . 
i 'm dying , claudia . i have cancer . i have cancer and i 'm dying , soon . it 's metastasized in my bones and i -- 
what am i giving up ? i 'm laid off last year . i 'm down to my last unemployment check . i 'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed . 
goddammit , where are you from , <person> ? 
should we go outside and bring him in ? 
you do n't know that . 
you have some ? 
come on , old pete . oh . 
it 's <person> . 
i am not . according to the geneva convention -- 
it was just like in my head . 
right over here . 
god , i would love to think i 'm an interesting teacher . i mean , i had maybe <number> or <number> teachers in high school who had any passion at all . 
thanks ... i 'll take it tonight . 
look , i just thought if you came out you might see what you 're missing . 
you 're the one who 's hand is shaking . 
yes , comrade . 
not for sure , <person> , but i will venture to guess that <person> left those letters with <person> <person> . 
big time . and news travels fast . would n't be surprised if the whole school knows about this <number> by tonight . 
he 's all business , ai n't he , <person> ? <person> , we could 've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal . we brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ... 
oh , <person> -- i 'm so afraid ! i just hope this all ends well . 
right . i screwed up . i fucked up . i messed up . anybody could have done better , especially you . i bet you 're real good at hitting targets through crowds . 
thanks . have you seen <person> ? 
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me . 
are you finished ? 
thank you . 
chic magazine ? 
yes ... i ... i agree ... 
<person> up the phone . 
and i ca n't guarantee the end will be quick . 
i really ca n't . besides , it 's pretty interesting . 
<person> webber ! right . quite the spotlight on that guy . 
yes . 
manhattans ? this time of night ? 
i did . we -- yeah , i know . 
cross my heart . 
go-toe . it 's some islands . 
i 'll see you at mass tomorrow . we 'll sit down and we 'll discuss the whole thing . 
all the food groups ? avoiding sugar ? caffeine ? i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness . we stay off hard liquor , cigarettes ... 
hello , <person> -- guess who ? that 's right , and you know everyday i say to myself , today could be the day ... so what do you say ... will you marry me ? then please can you get me through to <person> <person> ? 
there 'll be time for that . 
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart . 
i do n't think you understand her . it is n't sex she wants , it 's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it . 
uh huh ? 
sure i like her . 
so how 're you doing ? 
uh , no . there 's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat . 
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it . 
mm-mm . 
i tried again and got through . 
i believe you have a message for him ? 
whoa , <person> , i say when we pull the plug . get a hold of yourself . <person> , we 're on the verge of greatness and i 'm about this close to getting laid . now , the bus will be here on monday . until then no one leaves .

they do n't have substitute teachers where you go to school ? 
great .

epps , over . 
they wo n't make it . 
you have to be kidding . 
she really did n't do it for me , baby . how 'd you like <person> ? 
tell me about the interesting people you met , wo n't you ? 
that 's it . just do it , all right ? 
what do you got ... ? 
of course they 'll notice it . but look -- this is a good place for something . 
yeah , we sure have . 
has he gotten through to any ? 
yes ! 
that 's the < u > reason < /u > . 
oh , come on . 
you work too hard , <person> . 
shhhhh ... .tony . <person> , rest . 
she 's wearing a ring . 
relax , will you . 
jesus , why ? 
like hell i do . 
i saw these guy perform ... at altmont ... you know that ? they opened for the stones ... 
pretty far . i 'm told not to say anything about it on the phone , in case it 's tapped ... they think it 's best , safer , if i go away , at least till <person> 's found . 
actually , sir , you could be that someone . 
< u > what < /u > ? 
where to ? 
please , do n't hurt them , it 's not their fault . i 'm not the commander , i do n't know anything . 
<person> , i 'm sure . 
for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony . then there appeared among us <number> anti-social elements - what on earth are classified as `` criminals . '' 
do you know what i was doing in that shop ? 
<person> <number> . 
well , this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances . 
your flunkey said he was expected back tonight . 
there are no commercial lanes out here . face it , we 're out of range . 
them boys was tryin ' to pull me down pretty hard . 
that last martini . 
that 's right -- that sounds like trouble to me . 
teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline . 
fantastic but i 'm a little busy right now . <person> . do you want to come to dinner saturday ? i 'm having some friends over and i need a spare man . are you a spare man ? 
what are you going to do ? 
you have the pre-nup ? 
you own a home there ? 
you know what i 'd do , if i were you -- before the card game i 'd go to the purser 's office . 
i 'll have to re-energize . 
no . 
what , it 's not weird . i just cut the stupid hot dog in half . 
they 're on their way ... there 's a gook village half a klik downriver , <person> wants us to move in and search it asap , something 's going on ... where 's <person> ? 
fine . absolutely . must be disappointing though . must come as a hell of a shock . 
bigger than that . for want of a nail a < u > <person> < /u > was lost ... 
kill him . 
he 's pretty ... remarkable . 
that 's it -- the release lever -- look inside ! 
i 've been doing good , though . 
yeh , well my old machine kept eating messages . i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement , but finally ... 
i hate it too . 
i think i 'd like a little company . 
you 're pretty full of yourself , are n't you ? 
i 'll tell her but she wo n't take it . 
that 's a solid name . 
you do n't know shit about shit . 
i am a trained performer . 
you can do it . come on . <person> . just give it a try . 
i am a scientist ... ! not a philosopher . 
hold on ... 
te , kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie <number> te whenna uci . unsubtitled 
sure . 
sure . i 'll just leave 'em with the s.w.a.t . guy answers the door . 
we 've already done this . 
thanks , i 'll be fine . 
kurtz . i 'm supposed to kill him , just like he said . 
yeah ... you know ... fucking . 
and put it on expenses ? 
yeah . naturally vain -- but they 're about to close the betting table and i have n't a sou.. 
i just wondered . 
so you think you can get me ? 
gordon , i worked at bluestar , i know my way around , i have friends there ... inside . 
right now , yeah - you 're talking crap . 
but there was nothing , no one in the garden . 
he 'll need a pretext . he 'll never figure <number> out for himself . 
no . i do n't object . 
what 's a metrix ? 
in his mind , anyway , and soon enough in hers . she had written him many letters of love . 
you should work for yourself . 
gee , boy , what do you have ? you have plague ? 
so the mask is part of the down payment too . must be a really big job . 
ok , i will ... later . 
this is california , anything is possible . 
madison ! 
right . 
i do n't mean your head head - i 'm not gon na piss on your head - your hair an ' all ... just piss in the toilet . y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin ' down from <person> <person> . 
i do n't think they 're in school . 
<person> ! <person> ! good-bye , <person> . 
you 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy ! 
yes . 
i know , gentlemen , but it is in the hands of the court . we 're helpless , are n't we ? 
in the grub box . <person> morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon . spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground wo n't be so hard . 
pay him ? with what ? with what could i pay him ? every zloty i earn we spend on food ! 
skip it and jump , damn you ! this flak 's so close , i can smell it . 
come on . 
my gun ? 
i did n't cook up a story . i had a source . 
i 'm just curious . i saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand . can you do that with both hands ? 
i ’ m sure you would . but if i had <number> , i wouldn ’ t let you near it . now you tuck back in and rest until you ’ re told otherwise . and for what it ’ s worth , i wouldn ’ t try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality . i ’ d sooner shoot you than have you upset me ... 
madeleine . she 's besotted with me ; she 'd do anything i ask . she could pay you a midnight visit -- 
jesus christ ! 
she ai n't in on it . 
how was your flight ? 
now i 'll have to wait at least a week . if i announced it tomorrow , after what our new chief <person> saw this afternoon , they 'd hear her yelling from seoul to washington . 
yes , a despicable human being . he was in the ministry of culture . his job was to get rid of jews in the arts . 
i have to go . 
i put in for a replacement for you but no one ... 
yeah . when it comes to hunting , that 's true . 
yeah , but no presents till midnight . 
if you ’ ve come here to look after me , mr . <person> , thank you , but no thank you . i have <number> bodyguards , i don ’ t need a third ... 
have n't slept , have you ? 
yes , *sir* . <person> 's *go* henry . 
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night ? nighttime is my time . 
he had fish . 
so ? 
you can not continue to walk in at the last moment , <person> . 
we were afraid . <person> seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake . 
<person> up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up . 
so what ? ! so fucking what ? use your head , violet . the money is gone . <person> is coming here to get it . you think he 's going to believe me if i tell him his piss-hole son stole it ! is that what you think ? i do n't . you know what i think ? i think i 'm a dead man . i 'm <number> in the brain . that 's what i think ! 
christ , i do n't want to see her take a fall . she thinks i do , but ... 
thank you . 
i was < u > there < /u > , <person> ! i < u > saw < /u > ! it 's like he < u > wanted < /u > to shoot that cop . 
i do n't want to . 
well then , you 've got the sword and you 've got the armor ; all 's lacking is the steed . 
business is booming . got your drugs , got your illegals -- had a shooting the other night at big o 's -- <person> got ventilated . 
i remember that night . d'artagnan was drunk , the only time i 've seen him that way . the <number> of us were reveling , remember , <person> ? 
yes . yours . you have n't murdered anybody . you killed mitchell . was n't that an accident ? it must have been . if you kill a blackmailer , you kill him dead -- so that he ca n't talk anymore . 
i just think it 's too early to paint . that 's my opinion . 
and who do you suppose he is ? that policeman who arrested me , the <number> i bit ! he is mr . right ! 
victor . i love you , 
i see it . i do n't get it . 
it 's not that easy . 
i checked the place out . there were n't no dicks in there . 
no , sir . 
just let me sit here for a moment ? iíll go soon , and stop bothering you . 
do n't move me . 
i do n't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities . 
i think these cold , `` objective '' discussions are aggressive , <person> ... 
whatever 's out there < u > did < /u > flip over a canoe -- 
<person> . . . <person> . . . 
here , pick these up ! 
nixon , doofus ! it 's incredible . he should be shot . 
you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them . in fact , put <person> in the ground too . 
come here , honey ! 
oh ! yes ! here ! 
that might be the news we 've been waiting for . 
the <number> -- 
peace of mind . 
on the contrary , i 've observed he 's not only a good technical surgeon , he 's a good military surgeon . and that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the united states army . 
how did you find out ? 
i do n't know , frank -- but do n't you think that 's something we should find out ? 
how 'd you find me ? 
if he self-destructed . 
must have been hell , huh ? <number> <person> ? a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system . you were our prime suspect , till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it . 
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know ? 
hey ... he did n't look like no big time criminal to me . 
i 'd better call <person> -- she must be frantic . 
i was n't in the car . 
and all his works ? 
oooo ... big fucking scary guy . <person> put $ <number> on tomorrow 's game . 
zach , my boy ! how is tonights adventure going ? 
i 'm sorry but i think you better talk to someone else . 
yeah . 
that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina . 
i wanted to be sure of something , general -- something that has always preyed on my mind . i have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned.. 
but it was n't ! we got away ! we were walkin ' away ! 
okay , okay , look , ummm ... let 's just talk a little first and you 'll feel better , i promise . 
<person> . 
what is she doing ? okay , <number> % . 
that 's good . that 's good , sweetie pie . 
what 's that ? 
a piece of what ? 
better make that a certified check , <person> . 
he was there and then he was n't ! 
senior class fund-raising gig . i told 'em they could hose down the jeep . hey , come on . it 's for a good cause . 
we 've done this before , so many times . the last time was so long ago , but it feels like yesterday . 
what ... ? 
he was actually there ? you saw him ? 
difficult . i 'm difficult . 
will and <person> joining the titan . dr. crusher going to <person> <person> ... 
what ? 
if they actually bothered to bury her . 
i prefer to think , more like the sagacious owl . 
yes and no . 
you were n't at my game . 
how do you know ? 
i know . 
do you have a better idea ? 
no . 
yeah ? 
you had a nasty bump . 
had to work it out for myself , though , did n't i ? 
i 've got photographs of you at the trenton ramada looking very -- 
you probably do n't remember her , but <person> <person> lives right over there in number <number> . when she is n't drunk she runs a damn good acting class . 
pick a record . i feel like dancing . 
<person> , this - this story - does n't concern only you . i 'll be in it , too , wo n't i ? and <person> ? 
i had a lifeline . if i 've got a lifeline , i 'm okay . 
i probably am , but i do n't care . i mean , i was n't that blessed to begin with , and when would i have had time to make any improvements ... 
please , have a seat . 
i 've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed . 
have you had any before ? 
what happened when <person> tried to kill himself out of turn ? 
paris ? you came from paris ? 
please . 
no . i 'd have liked to . 
good . i think you 're an asshole . no , let me correct that , an immature asshole . <person> is fine , except you 're marrying my daughter and i 'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes . 
i think that 's what you ordered . 
i 'm protecting myself every way i know how , mrs. kane . this last week , i finally found out how i can stop your husband from being elected . if the people of this state learn what i found out this week , he would n't have a chance to - he could n't be elected <person> <person> . well , what i 'm interested in is seeing that he 's not elected . i do n't care whether they know what i know about him . let him keep right on being the great , <person> , moral - champeen of the people . just as long as - 
i do n't know , i had to go to chicago again . you were in kiev . you tell me . 
did n't ... ahhh ... look good . 
i 'm not sick . 
this 'bout the fifth time ? 
quaint ? ca n't imagine why . 
since i was <number> years old . they got a lot of explosives around mines . me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw . <person> , we had fun ! 
sorry - did n't copy . 
where exactly is it ? 
<number> people . in brainerd . 
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already . 
alright , i love you too . go to sleep . 
let me go ! i wan na see him ! 
now ... 
you know what i 'm saying . 
not really . 
like what ? 
an intelligent plan , <person> <person> , but listen to me well . it can be ruined in a single careless moment . keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat . 
he ca n't hear you . hi ... i 'm dr. weintraub ... . i was on duty when they brought him in ... i 've been going over his record ... he was brought in once before i understand ... ... '' catatonic stupor '' ... condition rendered him non-verbal for a period of - ... 
... aye sir ... ? 
yeah , we were caught in a storm . i went up there an innocent climber ... 
exactly . 
no . 
yeah , yeah . 
i have a warrant in my pocket that says different . 
how am i supposed to not get excited , listening to you trying to extort your employee , you sarcastic prick ? 
just carrying a bag . 
february first . 
-- you 've done worse than let <person> slip away , you 've got people feeling sorry for him -- i did n't think that was possible . a conspiracy like this -- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone 's neck . you build from the outer edges and you go step by step . if you shoot too high and miss , then everybody feels more secure . you 've put the investigation back months . 
what are we going to do with ... 
cole and munoz . i 'm uh ... letting them run with the ball for a while . 
yes , i 'm here ... 
maybe it is ! how the fuck would you know ? ! you do n't know a fucking thing ! you ca n't get scared , can you get angry ? ! 
this case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to washington . your old boss is coming out . 
what 're you gon na do ? 
what 's your name ? 
scotty , can we make it inside ? 
that 's all , mrs. halligan . thanks . 
bye . 
a loser ? 
bullshit . 
nevertheless , you could have mentioned the sauce . well , i see you have a camera . 
oh , no , man . i ca n't . 
mr helpmann . i 've changed my mind . i 'd like to accept the transfer - am i too late ? 
i -- i 'm sorry , sir . i -- i have a bill -- 
he hated everything i did . hated me . got drunk and beat the shit out of me , daily ... 
yeah . no pain in my neck now . feels good . 
are n't the roses beautiful ? 
you 're serious ? 
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break <number> bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... it 's insane , i ca n't take it anymore . 
you do n't ? 
no ! ! ! 
well , i guess they do those things . well , i trust you had a good year . 
it 's really quite simple ... the three- body problem , you know . 
no , that 's bad management . 
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . <person> has been 
you already made the delivery ? 
yes , <person> . 
perhaps you 've got the time for that , <person> <person> , i certainly do n't . i 've got an entire hospital to look after , and you have your real patients . do n't waste your time with him sir , it 's like talking to a wall . i do n't mean to be harsh , but truthfully what can you do for him ? i 'll be back later for his bath . and <person> <person> <person> would like to see you when you have a moment . good day sir . 
care to make a small wager ? 
more or less . 
fuck that ! the last part 's the best . you dry-dive <number> stories and blammo ! <person> right into the big black . 
then why go back now ? 
no , why should i ? it 's yours . 
lint ? 
drew ! 
it 's hard to explain . 
all <number> . 
you did n't ! it 's tinkerbell . <person> wants to be sure he 'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night . well come on in , at least ! 
you know full well there is , and i go to meet it now . come witness my revenge . 
all i have to do is scream . 
i do it all the time . bust their fucking balls . 
i had a guy 's fingers in my asshole tonight . 
no . i 'm going to find out . 
this is going to give you nightmares . 
you seem like a likable enough guy . it 's hard to judge . 
okay man i ai n't going to push . but remember the revolution is n't going to wait for anyone . come on , we 'll give you a lift . 
deep breaths -- 
that cop who bought it ... you did n't tell us he was your partner . 
i 've got a present for you ... 
tell pino . 
men are very sensitive , you know . we need to feel loved and desired , too . 
well , do n't you somewhere ? stuff ? belongings ? 
i got a surprise for you , blondie ... 
that 's than un on christmas i was tellin ' you about . 
no , i do n't , because you 're not telling me anything ! 
have faith . 
make them talk and you got <person> , <person> ! 
look , <person> , i 've been a good teacher . 
want me to carry <person> ? 
you 're on . let 's go ! an ' keep it quiet . 
oh please . i ca n't have you do that . 
so there is only <number> key ... 
you were impressed with something . it 's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television . 
your rug was in the car . 
randall . 
yeah . a great big one . 
no . she has gone out . 
i can hardly see -- 
are you sure ? how do you know ? 
no . no -- i 'm just -- i 'm just a little worried about my future . i 'm a little upset about my future . 
i 've changed my mind again . what 's new orleans like this time of year ? <person> <person> . or let 's just see where the road takes us . 
hi . i 've got sort of a hypothetical question . do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider 's proportional strength and agility ? 
i guess not . 
look , i 've got a wife . i do n't care if either of you ever get caught . 
well , you 've got a croc alright , they 're keystone species . 
<person> , that bunch is out for blood . if i throw <person> in their teeth now -- 
westley , what about the r.o.u.s . 's ? 
do n't give me that coffee , you rummy . now blow ! 
actually , if it 's all the same , i 'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p . seeing how we do n't have much time for this whole transition thing . 
an accident ? ! 
american jews , and there 's lots of them , what have they done for us ? what do they think they 're doing ? people here are dying , have n't got a bite to eat . the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany ! 
you bet . 
so you do n't think that 's funny ? it is funny ! everyone else thinks so ! maybe you did n't get it . 
<person> dwayne why do n't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin ? 
i 've lost my car . 
are we locked up ? 
you 're a bit eccentric , are n't you ? 
could you do anything about it ? 
microphone check , <number> , <number> . <number> , <number> . yo tavis , i be lovin ' yo show but mantan you is foul . why you perpetrating ? you a sellout . 
because she 'll scare them away . 
you got ta buck up , man , you ca n't go into the tournament with this negative attitude -- 
what ? 
i was in hell . i 've been there . it 's horrible . i do n't want to die , <person> . 
big shot ! for you , i would n't lift a finger -- but for her , i 'll fix a little something to eat . 
naw . they paroled me . 
what do you think the devil is going to look like if he 's around ? nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long , red , pointy tail . no . i 'm semi-serious here . he will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great god-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing ... he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important . just coax along flash over substance ... just a tiny bit . and he will talk about all of us really being salesmen . and he 'll get all the great women . 
i know ruby . he 's very big on respect . likes me very much . 
according to <person> <person> , inside the statue of <person> was a secret compartment , perhaps containing the book of the living . 
yeah ... i 'd like that . 
i 'm part of the game , just like you . 
yeah , she came by last night . shaking like a junkie , wanting me to make a copy of some clip . 
i swear to god , <person> . when is the last time you went on a real live date ? 
what ? 
i thought you were a man of god . 
i 'll see you tomorrow ... 
you 're -- ? what ? ! 
we 're good to loan in . 
you suppose maybe we 're in somebody 's field ? 
<number> years of counselling you see a lot of -- 
yeah . 
yes . yes . 
there are n't any personal lives for people like us . he made that very clear to me <number> years ago - if i 'd thought of my life with <person> as a personal life , i 'd have left him then - 
she left you , <person> . she 's not your responsibility . she takes very good care of herself . if she wants to romance the kid , it ai n't your business . your business is to snap out of it . 
based on what we know of him , that would seem inevitable . 
them . 
look , i came down here to face everybody . i did n't want to slink away like some coward ... 
either do i. i love you , ro . you know that . you 're a total mystery to me - but i love you . 
it 's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever . 
i do n't know ... 
not tonight . 
so <person> <person> would n't want a professional hit . that 'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident . 
i think so , <person> . yes . 
they must be broken . i 'm hanging in my straps ! we 're inverted ! 
<person> ' basketball game . 
right behind you . 
did you come ? 
... or lem me guess -- toxic waste ? 
they did n't like me . they never liked me . 
thank you . thank you . 
oh man ... come on , i do n't want no janitor job . 
what 's your favorite movie star ? 
yeah , yeah if this is another ancient farrari . . . 
well . there 's the bible story . <person> took a rib from <person> and made eve . maybe men chase women to get the rib back . when <person> took the rib , he left a hole there , place where there used to be something . and the women have that . maybe a man is n't complete as a man without a woman . 
dad , do n't start . 
nope . 
what ? 
i confirmed it on the scanner . i knew something was up because <person> used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know <person> only barks at bad people . 
jack -- 
abduction ? 
probably shot a few . scattered the rest . murderers . 
well , you never know , do you ? 
he 's lunching with the man who 's buying the harris street property , you know , that oil lease man ... so that 's why he 's late . you getting a headache ? 
the kids are in the yahd , playing near the cah . how 's that sound ? 
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! 
first han , now you . when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself ? ... 
all right , i 'm leaving . i 'm sorry ma'am . 
how do you know about me ? 
-- -fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to <person> <person> at creep -- 
that 's ok . 
i 'll remember that , my lordship . 
that was so great ! 
why did you do this ? 
okay . i mean , i agree , but ... are n't you supposed to be out , like , trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something ? 
hmmm . 
yeah . you got the whole story just right . 
thanks a lot , <person> . 
do you have any idea what my life is like ? 
at least . 
you mother ... 
got it . nice touch . <person> , pick me up at <number> . the de-brief is at ten <number> . 
no baby . we 'll all be right in . 
it ai n't the money - it 's the high . the big fat floating 'what if ? ' and it 's way more profitable . nobody ever wins . so you never have to pay out . 
beautiful . <person> 's business ? 
commander , face to face at last.. you have my thanks.. 
special to me , too . 
what are you crying for ? <person> <person> . it 's not your fault there 's no money ... 
they own the information he 's disclosing . the truer it is , the greater the damage to them . if he lied , he did n't disclose their information . and the damages are smaller . 
you 're sure of that ? 
this is impressive , gentlemen . of course , it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was . 
that line was tampered with ... 
i do n't think you understand the full implications of -- 
<number> day you 'll be nice to me . we might both be dead and buried , but you 'll be nice . at least civil . 
what thing ? oh , <person> ... i thought you was layin ' . 
i did n't know you knew who <person> was , <person> . 
everything i ... you know ... 
it ’ s okay . <person> , i ’ ve never paid for it . but please don ’ t feel like you have to explain yourself to me . 
i 've changed my hair , you see . since our last session . those old snaps look rather dowdy now . 
you really want me to put all this stuff back on ? 
look , i 'm a very nervous man . i got ta have a job where i come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at <number> . and twice a year i got ta have a <number> month vacation . 
say what ? 
i 'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley . 
that 's fucked it . what do we do now ? no money , no weed ; it 's all been swapped for a pile of corpses . 
if it rains , i 'll buy myself an umbrella . 
down front as always . 
man , if someone had a gun to your head and said : `` you got ta tell me what 's goin ' on with that person over there or i 'll kill you '' ... they 'd have to kill you ... 'cause you do n't have a clue for ... or about ... anyone ... to be like that , i do n't think you , you have any of that for your own life ... do you believe you 're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m. ? open your eyes in the morning ? i do n't think you do ... i do n't think so ... i think you are way < u > low < /u > ... like in your estimation . in your estimation of yourself . so how 'd you get that way ... ? 
i do n't care if you love him ! i 'm telling you he 's no good for you ! 
he 's been playin ' <person> <person> nigh on sixty years . 
is freddie in rome ? 
your words sting more sharply than your whip . 
inspector rock will pay you . in cash . a <number> dollars on the ninth of every month . 
your wheel ! at fifteen em-pee-aitch i roll out ! i double back , grab <number> of 'em and beat it out of him ! the uzi ! 
some people think bein ' shy is a disease , but it do n't bother me . 
we insist . 
because he asked you to ! he entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body . he asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you : his katra . his living spirit . 
that 's okay . you seem pissed off all the time , though . 
shit . we do n't know what he is . 
at sea , then -- a voyage to a new world ? …she lands upon a vast and empty shore . she is brought to the duke…orsino . 
what are you suggesting ? 
but sergeant ... 
i 'm sorry , mrs. mulwray . 
go for the bucks . 
<person> . 
return 'em . maybe you 'll get your money back . 
<person> smoke ! i forgot all about that . send a wireless at once , `` <person> <person> <person> . <person> escaped again . watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in miami . have your new york office keep tabs on king westley . intercept all messages . want her back at all costs ! '' 
and when i finally agree to spread my legs , you accuse me of treating you like meat . 
that 's just <person> 's way . 
so what happened ? 
do n't forget our mission , <person> . we should act . now . time is running out . 
nonsense ! she got at she deserved . 
i 'm not drunk . yet . 
but i 'm a quick study . tell your deputy d.a . -- <person> ? -- that i 'll see him in court . 
this an invite to a necktie party , <person> ? 
i just believe in giving credit where credit is due . and i believe that i 'm the impetus behind your failure to wed . 
hey ! you want good stuff , or you want shit ? 
<person> . we do n't have to watch it . come on . 
i 've been trying to talk to him about it . he says everything 's fine , but i do n't know . automatically , you know , i leap to the worst conclusions . 
yes , <person> . i have always been here . i have always worked in the garden . 
he ca n't walk , <person> ! 
i know . 
i want to thank you for what you 've done . 
you 'll like it . 
no question from you is innocent , <person> <person> . 
i just need to lay down . i 've been running around all day . 
you 're a smart guy . tell me what it says . 
yeah , yeah -- 'bye . 
surprised ! 
i am afraid of nothing . 
go to hell , <person> <person> , what 's that supposed to mean -- 
he even signs them , in his own name , can you believe it ? i 'd sign someone else 's name . i 'd sign his name . if i wrote them , that is . which i do n't . 
she 's off her fucking rocker -- 
it was n't an 'accident , ' it was n't a boat propeller , or a coral reef , or jack the ripper . it was a shark . it was a shark . 
can we not talk about this ? 
is that normal ? 
was n't no bullet . 
to the bastille . and death . 
maybe thirty more minutes . as your attorney , i advise you to drive at top speed . it 'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal . are you ready for that ? checking into a vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid . 
i would like to use the bathroom -- 
it seems that he was a thief and an imposter . 
that 's nice . 
i'11 get right to the point . i 'm smarter than you . i'11 find out what i want to know and i'11 get it from you whether you like it or not . 
i called them . if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer , i 'd sit closer . if i wanted to kiss him , i 'd just do it . you want <person> <person> ? grab him . 
go that 's the way we 're going to go . what do you say ? 
nothing ... 
what ? 
neither do i . 
< u > <person> shut up < /u > ! ! ! 
okay , <person> . thanks . thanks a lot . 
does this mean what i think it means ? 
you came out early . 
you just seem to know all these things about me and i do n't know anything about you , you know . what kind of music do you like ? 
so not over her , in fact . 
what was it about ? 
in ages , i know , me neither . 
i would n't know where to start . i guess it was about <number> man framing another . he thought if the other guy got blamed , people would over look his own wrong doings . 
there 's love and there 's behaving like you do because there 's nobody to tell you not to . 
would n't lie to you . and they 've got all-you-can-eat buffets . you can eat a lot , ca n't you ? 
i 'm sorry . i really should n't have -- 
yes . 
sir , we really need this job . we 're desperate . my husband spends far more than he can ever earn . i do n't mean he 's lazy - he 's not at all - he works all day long . it 's just ! he 's not practical . <person> simply slips through his fingers , it 's really ridiculous , your excellency . i know you help musicians . you 're famous for it . give him just this <number> post . we 'd be forever indebted ! 
what ? ? where 'd you hear that ? 
because i never assume anything . 
the metro . 
i -- i do n't know . i -- i 'm afraid they 've got me licked . 
all but .. how < u > you < /u > doing ? 
i think you 'd better . 
there must be another way ! 
wo n't <person> <person> take care of us ? 
and how is this helping ? come on say , good-night to all your new friends and let 's go home . 
it galls me to watch you . you can do as much in days as i can in years . men like the 'the dreamer ' are protected . out of everyone 's grasp it seems , but yours . 
he 's been looking everywhere for weeks , <person> . it 's not that easy after you 've been locked away . 
yeah ? 
no . 
he 's nothing . he 's in my acting class . but he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named <person> <person> . i thought <person> could be interested in a deal like this . he could use it . he could afford it . 
come on ! 
i rock a harmony . 
he has already agreed to come . 
did you know my mother died recently ? 
you could say that . 
do n't worry about it , boss . 
i 'm , like , yelling at her , 'what are you doing ? ' and she 's going <number> , <person> ! ' way mental . 
no . 
i also have a phone . i 'm confident that in <number> minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again ... in the non-prostitute sense obviously . 
yeah . 
<number> minutes ago , i 'm looking forward to a quiet dinner . i get a note ... 
that 's the ticket , laddie . 
me , sir ? 
right . so why is he dying ? he does n't appear to have any broken bones , no entry wounds of any kind -- what 's killing him ? 
at <number> o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic . 
still not here . 
no . 
just do me a favor . think about what this is costing everybody . not just the railroad . 
what are you doing ? 
what ? 
i do n't < u > think < /u > so . 
give me a 400-foot magazine ; we may be down there for a while . 
< u > you < /u > thought i was going to do <person> <person> next , so you sent your partner ... 
<person> as she goes . 
he 's dragged me into every gin mill on the block . 
yes . 
what did the psychologists say was wrong with <person> ? 
this ca n't be happening ? 
shit . 
<person> , start breaking up some chairs . you 'll need weapons . 
when nobody 's looking . 
he 's always been very forward-thinking . he invested wisely . 
no . 
or ... . 
you be careful of that little bastard . he 's dying to get in your pants , you know . 
then why 'd you call me ? 
you see ? you see ? i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call . do n't you get it ? i 'm in a convent ! you 're a nun ! 
your dad has stood for plenty . now let 's get down to cases . when did you see the dale girl last ? 
git . 
him getting us stranded out here does n't do much good either . 
go get <person> , i do n't care how sick he is . <person> him up yourself , and bring him to my father 's house . 
it 's a town ! 
i know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show `` bounty hunter '' making trouble . i want you outta town and i want you outta town now ! 
i 'm with <person> on this . 
way cool . then you know where the dinosaurs are . 
hindsight . it 's like foresight without a future . 
you 're wrong , <person> <person> . there are people who live and die without e'er seeing it . they ca n't see the country for the money in their pockets -- and some think their state 's the country , or the way they live is the country , and they 're willing to split the country because of that . well , i hope you 'll meet all those , when you 're grown . you 'll meet the fire-eaters and the circassian beauties -- that 's part of the fair , to be sure . but if we 'd had to depend on them , in a permanent way , the country would have stopped at the allegheny mountains . 
the front stairs . 
right , right -- is n't she fun to tease ? 
cougar , you 're on the ball . 
so what if i do n't ? 
no , you gim me your gun , boy ! 
just forget about it . 
i 'm not a violent man , <person> <person> . not by nature , anyhow . but if you hurt <person> in any way , i 'll kill you . does that seem honorable ? 
pretty much . 
no ! he was crazy . i did n't -- he looked -- i thought -- 
i 'll call it ... tails . 
... or grown-ups , who still like to be children . 
well ... yeah . 
no i did n't see anybody i know . no i do n't want to go to school here tomorrow . i want to go home . 
a lot smaller . 
rattling . rustling . 
well , sir it 's not good . roll the tape ... the x-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon , a manmade virus ... 
keep your voice down . 
... and i 'd be lying to you if i did n't tell you , i 'm about out of moves , <person> ... 
interesting theory . where 's the proof ? 
french guys ? you mean like from france ? 
<person> military . went back to the fighting . disappeared . who knows ... ? 
a wise policy . but if you did , i can assure you , the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand ... in awe . <person> , a president ... i mean , why not shoot a president ? 
swarthout . yes . he 's the man who sold us the ranch in -- 
you promise ? 
right now , < i > your < /i > presence is creating more of a threat . i do n't think you have any concept of what we do here -- how meticulous our preparations must be . we are about to send twelve people through <number> <number> miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal . so it 's rather critical to point them in the right direction . and we certainly do n't need you looking over our shoulders . besides , i do n't believe there is any evidence that the killer < i > is < /i > amongst us . i do n't see too many other dead bodies littering the place . 
he won . he was a winner . that bothers you . 
you know when you know . it makes you shivver , it eats at your insides . you know ? 
you 'll want to count the money in privacy . you know , you do n't need ... 
the causes of suffering arise from true sources . attachment , desire , envy , hatred , greed , unkindness , wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering . 
what do you say we send a bottle over ? 
we do n't have the money . 
maybe after we get done with him i 'm gon na buy us some girls . 
you 've stabbed me , man . 
i do n't understand . 
wait 'll you see ! 
i was , until last night . <person> asked me to fly <person> <person> in for today 's reception . 
yes , we 're going to have this conversation again . i ... i have to leave . i have to move out . 
a fact ! last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden . why ? because he had something buried in there . something a dog could scent . 
ready when you are . 
fuck damnation . <person> redemption . we are <person> 's unwanted children , with no special place and no special attention , and so be it . 
why me ? 
tell 'em your father gave it to you . 
we got his stinkin ' ass in the deepest , darkest cell in the whole place . but it just so happens that right now he 's got a special visitor . 
you said the vision , the images . they 're just that . just pictures . they ca n't hurt you . that 's what you always said . 
ohhh ! 
oh , well that 's all right . what ? 
so what ? 
save me the sermon . i 've heard it all before , it 's boring . 
you got ta just look the other way . 
you 've come to lecture me ? 
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization . 
i 'm ready to communicate with you now . 
well , it does n't matter . go and tell your master that <person> from the court of camelot is here . 
we are all going straight to hell . either hell or prison , whichever comes first . 
see for yourself . 
well , let 's go talk to your doctor . 
let 's see . 
tea would spoil my dinner . <number> meal a day , i 'd hate to spoil it . 
dunno ... flameout maybe . whatever happens , you can bet it 's final . but who would want to find out ? 
thank you very much , clarence . 
that 's right . 
please . <person> <person> is the ultimate master of horror . 
follow close . we 'll cross the next meadow . 
you 're shelly ? 
the extrovert . 
... so he 's dictating you a new bestseller ? whatever that is , it 's not our son . 
<person> karras . 
because . 
what 's wrong <person> ? did i spend too much ? 
well , mademoiselle , he 's the kind of a man that , well , if i were a woman and i ... were not around , i should be in love with <person> . but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man . 
what ? 
orson , please ... it 's too bright 
<person> stole it ! <person> , my ass ! the stella booted with your mom 's wheels . 
and now ... ? 
i think i understand without your telling me . i know something of your history , <person> . i know that you have n't written for <number> years . 
kind of . you did n't know ? 
i 'm glad you think so . if you ask me , it 's foolish . i told you there 's no sense in our staying here tonight . we could make new york in less than <number> hours . 
why ? 
i got a news flash , man , another shot of this and i 'll have sex with you . 
alright , alright , i 'm in a bad mood , okay ? 
<person> m ? you make me pop your fuckin ' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit ? <person> <person> ? you dumb motherfucker ! 
how did you know our nanny 's name is ... lucky guess ! 
uh-huh . 
we will have to try again . his knowledge is great . without it , we can not hope to win . 
yeah , <person> ? 
oh , i had them removed . 
got it . 
my <number> friends have my share of the money . i 'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler . 
it was him , man ! 
we should go out on a double date . 
take a look at this . 
he needed my help . 
if you did n't want to do it , you should have said so ! is this about gas money ? 
what happened ? 
we 're not going to hurt you . 
it 's alright , <person> . you do n't have to write actual scenes ? 
more than anything in the world . 
you thought <person> 'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear . all you needed was a sap to pin it on , and you 'd just met me . you thought , hey , a deadbeat , a loser , someone the square community wo n't give a shit about . 
your father loved me . he wanted to marry me . but he was afraid of hurting the gentle , delicate cathy . you spoiled his life ——you 've ruined mine —— 
erin -- 
he 's <number> of the best fliers in the country . right now he 's planning a trip to japan . 
what 's he talking about ? 
i remember ... from always ... at first i prayed to you ... come and get me ... take me home ... you did n't come ... 
and , america ? 
try me . 
kill him ! he 's the one ! ! 
not for fifty <number> . an ocean liner maybe . but fifty <number> in gold , they come looking for . 
i just made it up . it means , `` get me out of there . '' what the hell 's that ? 
as it happens , i was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems ? 
sure , ever been to the riverbottom ? 
we do n't have to put ourselves through this again , <person> . 
i told the guy -- - i told the guy , this is n't even my order . 
what 's that ? free ! 
not quite . 
i guess they do . 
i did n't mean to say anything bad about you . i know you 're good . you did n't mean no harm . did you ever think about killin ' yourself on purpose like my daddy did ? 
oh now , do n't be silly . 
seven thirty-five .. here , `` <person> <person> <person> <person> . '' i was gon na pin it to your wall . 
... there 's a <number> dollars here ! 
i do n't know that . <person> <person> 's already dead . 
you may step down . 
oh yes , i am . not an ounce of excitement , not a whisper of a thrill , this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice . 
wow . um , well ... ca n't you just force yourself awake ? 
wait a minute . wait a minute . <person> , you leave my heart alone ... 
max . 
i 'll see that he stays calm . pack the money up and put it in the trunk . 
the safety what ? fuck that ! 
henry , no ! 
you 're on . 
you met people . 
yes . 
my power cells continually re- charge themselves . 
well , that 's an appealing offer , but ... considering the options ... you go back . me , i 'm going to insectopia . 
i 'm going up to the institute . 
uh , i do n't want to bet it all . 
you do n't believe in it . 
let 's take our neighbor out . let him fuckin ' walk back . 
now , please , <person> , do n't start figuring it out in cows . 
sell that . i figured it could only have painful associations for wash . 
i dunno . <person> <person> always puts on all this sick stuff that i have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff . there 's supposed to be a don knotts movie on here someplace . 
what was the nature of your relationship with dr. paley . 
where ? 
so more men were slaughtered uselessly ! 
leia ! <person> 's my sister . 
like i said , i ca n't turn it off . 
now do n't get sassy , ma . 
i took care of everybody . 
whatever . <person> . 
and the questionnaire ... ? 
a night like this , it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment . 
who . 
you 'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve . there is no wade , there was <number> , but he died a long time ago , he 's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name , you understand ? 
yes , i will . 
got you ! 
i do n't care . <person> . 
what 's that fucker ever done for us ? 
eventually . does it have to be right now ? 
<number> . but no one this important . 
i sure as hell hope so . let 's go . 
not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill ! 
got a pencil ? 
there 's no time to discuss it ! 
was the dog wearing a collar with the leeds ' name on it ? 
yep , except a name for this place . 
and sometimes you think you do n't ? ! well , get away then ! 
i will . 
i 'd say you must have the wrong number . 
fine , thank you . i 'm in trouble . that is ... now i am ! 
i was wondering if you might help me . i ... i seem to have lost my congressional medal of honor somewhere around here . 
you sure this is okay ? 
yeah , right . the inspiration . it 's a true story anyway , so i do n't suppose it can hurt , can it ? 
so ? 
jack ... god , it ’ s been so long ... you look ... 
you too . 
what do you keep making me out to be ? 
c'mon -- 
if you want to know 'what it 's like to be a child ' , you need to learn how to play ... 
that 's right . 
right by the airport -- oh , amber ... 
... they may have followed it < u > too < /u > precisely . 
oh , so sorry ! did n't mean to offend your droid . you think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy ? 
i want to live for the <number> days . 
oh yeah . 
it 's a miracle . 
national <person> <person> . 
what ? ! 
the point is - in the cathedral , a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you <number> beside us our nearest and dearest friends . 
you do n't believe in anything ? 
never . 
who would believe that ? and you know , someone else might recognize her . she was as well known as the castle rock . 
it 's a pleasure to meet you . i 'm <person> <person> . 
the resemblance is amazing . 
would you care to be more specific ? 
bloody hell , <person> ! this is a bit heavy . this is london , not the lebanon ' who do you think i am ? 
sure , and i guess it was just convenient there was <number> less person to split the gold with . 
shit ! it 's both of them . the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as <person> . but they 've moved on- -they 're getting closer to sidney . they 're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill . they 're looking for the new <person> . 
we 're out of a job . 
no . 
god , no . i thought about it for practically the entire flight ... 
i can help you solve the case , i can tell you who did it . 
get her the fuck out of here . get her out of here . 
<number> kids were found mutilated in the woods . lock the door after me . 
mimi , jorgensen , <person> , <person> ... .. 
good morning . 
yeah ? i better see some money out of it . 
you know , i 'm kind of tired . i 'm just gon na go home if it 's all the same to you . 
if they are smart , they take naps . 
not if it clears the air . 
tell mrs. washington i am compelled to stay a while longer . 
sure . and i 'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service was n't his idea 
i did n't want that <person> egg - it was chipped ! 
they did n't think he 'd be so cagey , that 's all . they 'll get him next time . 
do n't wait by the phone . if he 's really been walking this whole time , he 's out of our jurisdiction ... 
the case could be made . 
i thought i 'd take it off for the drive over to ibm . it 's kind of uncomfortable . 
yeah , well i like to think i 'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters . 
now why should n't you , <person> ? things are different now ... 
what 's that ? 
and ... what 's my name again ? 
do n't try to charm me , <person> <person> . 
i bet we can fix it . 
oh , god . i miss her . i ca n't believe she 's with that guy now ! i 'm never going to see her again . i love her so much . what a fucking monster she is ! 
you can stay here . 
i miss her . what do you think happens to someone after they die ? 
you look so ... i do n't know , you look like you 've really been in it . 
twelve . 
i see.. and ... how do you respond to being called – hmmm ... – yes , `` the pickaninny of the art world . '' 
i did n't write anything else 'cause nobody , including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one . 
i 'm just having my last few drinks . 
yes , i see . 
c'mon . 
no . but i do n't think that matters . 
i said okay ? 
of course ! i 'm fine ! i put on your beautiful dress , i slightly made up ... i tried to get beautiful ! do n't you like it ? 
today ? started off great ... 
what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time . 
lieutenant , actually . <person> <person> <person> . i 'm the head of the resurrection protective force . and you are ? 
work , work , work . <person> ? when was that blizzard ? 
you - you 're going to fuckin ' jail , buddy , you ai n't getting away with this <number> ! ! ! ! ! 
i do n't know , he quit dealin ' but i 'll bet he 'll smoke us out . 
<person> dwayne know about this ? 
you got the parole , did n't you ? 
is someone in the room with you ? 
luke , you got to listen to me . all you got to do is just give up nice and quiet , just play it cool . 
forget it , the main thing -- -- did you call me a failure ? 
no . 
capades ? they do n't do it . <person> ? outlawed . why ? 
it 's the damn money men . you never know who 's a windbag , and who 's got the goods . and then they all think < u > they 're < /u > a director ... 
then we run our hands down a man 's arms and legs -- like this -- in case they got what you 're looking for attached to a string . see what i mean , <person> ? 
i ’ ll just full yours up to the top . <person> anniversary , sweetheart . 
`` <person> '' ? bob ! <person> bob bob . bob what ? 
my mother 's doing quite well , thank you very much . 
mom ! 
i want to talk to you , pierce . 
where in government ? 
you realize , sir , that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order . 
looks like <person> . 
and then ? 
what else could i be ? what else could i be ? we 're not living in the real world here . you 're living out some fantasy land from the past , or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts ... there are some hard facts here . 
i 'm relieved at <number> a.m . 
we ? i 'm going home . and , judging by that coat , i 'd say you have to get back to the barber college . 
i found it on the seat . 
i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket ! 
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt , <person> president . 
no . 
you do n't mind getting on people 's nerves , do you ? 
answer the question ! 
but a kiss can be even deadlier , if you mean ... it . 
no ... there 's a couple of things i 'm still working on . 
you 're doin , okay ? that 's good , <person> .

yes , even the shooting of your father was business , not personal ... 
we have our new army . dr. yueh , put the weirding module on him .

and they 're all locked together in here ... and he wo n't let go of them ! 
what did you say ? 
<person> . 
what was the top bid ? 
that 's my point . for thirty years you 've been looking through things and under things and behind things . well what i 'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things . he said our enemy in already here . well maybe it is . maybe our enemy is , literally , already here . 
depends what night . 
yes , boss . i got it right . 
that 's too bad . 
yes . <person> 's crazy about <person> .

no . 
you get straight to the point , do n't you ? 
and this , only <number> of these letters , major . i have lots of them . 
but <number> of those guys -- not <number> of them -- knew her at all . each <number> was convinced that she was perfect for them , but they did n't see her . and she never showed up so they could n't see her . it 's a very symbolic thing happening . she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be . 
captain , we 're receiving transmission from paradise city . they 're demanding to know our intentions . 
it 's fine . tell me what -- 
i ca n't tell you how much i admire you . you have a wonderful way with people . and you 're very insightful . i feel like you 've seen me clearly ... i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was . you 've made that possible for me . 
she 's a local . when the dudes come out to new mexico , they went to wallow in latin glamour . this is a bad town for blondes . 
al , you ca n't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close . <person> , <person> ! if we do n't start reading between the lines here ! y'all got ta start thinking on a different level - like the cia does . we 're through the looking glass . here white is black and black is white .

oh yes , i saw . <person> child . 
as you wish ... 
<person> does n't understand . people who make the kind of money my brother makes do n't carry money on them . they keep it all in various accounts . 
i still see that boy 's eyes . 
<person> ! 
right . 
i 'd like to read a prepared statement . 'while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form , we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace . ' 
yes , <person> .

in front of <person> 's , he got hit by a bus . i knew him . the firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back . 
well , you see , your uncle did n't bother with that sort of thing . he left everything to us . he traveled most of the time , and enjoyed himself . you should do the same thing , mr . <person> . 
you 're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble . 
<person> , in your absence , <person> has become a galactic controversy ... until the federation council makes policy , you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of genesis ... consider it a quarantined planet . and a forbidden subject . 
hidden camera . 
okay . bye . 
i love my blender . 
<number> letter in <number> years ... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out ... 
oh , no , sir . i 've never had a woman do that . i 'm sure she drowned . 
okay , here it is - one , we got gooks in the fuckin ' perimeter . 
i 'm interested in who handled it . 
our lives , the revolution , my career ?

you always get to go first . 
a zillion , huh ? that 's a lot .

by a curious coincidence , it 's my day off , too . 
it is true . you know how you love , <person> ? you dedicate a book to someone . 
it 's your roll -- 
heh heh . <person> <person> . 
slip up and change into a skirt , else he 'll create something terrible . do n't you want to make a good impression on your first day ? 
vivian . i 'm paying you to be you . be you . have you ? ever been in love with anyone ? 
just tell me where i can find him , friend . 
congratulations . by crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet , you 've become the third white man ever to hear of it . 
no no , the bigger the better . but i must say , they could be a little brighter . nothing 's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites . 
not ... quite . 
it 's when you say , `` everybody else cheats why should n't i ? '' but i do n't -- i do n't < u > hate < /u > -- him . i ... loved him once , <person> . very much . i just got ... tired . maybe it was n't all his fault . he ... what 's happening ? oh , my god ... 
victims . are n't we all . 
yes . he likes windows . 
the following morning . sunday . 
what is it ? 
i do n't know . it 's early ... i love you . 
do n't press your luck , <person> . 
what does that mean ? 
anything to help you out , <person> . 
go to bed . you 've got to be at work in the morning . there 's nothing more we can do tonight . 
oh , stop behaving like a fool , <person> . 
if i tell you , will you pull the story ? not write about me ? 
you used his credit card . 
always count on old wade for a good screwing . why should i always pay more , sell cheap ? why should you guys make all the money . you and <person> and <person> . <person> 's right . 
i do n't know what to say to him . i ca n't . 
do you like it ? 
yes sir . 
i thought you got rid of ...

soon as i finish my coffee . 
gee , that 's sad . do n't that make you sad ? 
are n't you afraid of me ? 
you lie ! 
they think you did it . 
that 's it . little red riding hood jumps out of the wolf 's guts with hardly a scratch . ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half ? 
huh ? 
nancy . 
details , pokrif . from what i saw he had an incredible body . 
he 's a friend . from the neighborhood . we were just talking . 
we could , if i 'm not in jail . 
i do n't want to be paranoid ... i mean , maybe it 's a game . some kind of mind game . 
oh , what do they know ? 
somebody has to pay for that error . and it 's not me . 
not anything built into the chassis . if it had n't come loose -- 
yes . do you mind ? 
then kiss me again for i am not mistook .

what about the house ? 
who 's the guy she 's gon na marry ? 
some of them . 
and you are a son who does n't love his mother ! 
careful ? was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while i was still in ze womb ? 
i do n't know , airport i guess . 
it 's ok. do n't worry about it . accidents happen . 
stay as long as you like , son . no rush . 
yes . <person> ! 
are n't they ? now look at this <number> , mrs. voss , and -- 
restless . 
i get no kick from champaign , mere alcohol does n't faze me at all , but i get a kick out of you . 
it 's already built ! there 's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff , but beneath that there 's these old catacombs that the christians built 'bout a <number> fucking years ago to bury their dead . we 're sitting right on top of it -- here .

i 'm asking what you 're here for . 
ray -- i 'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn .

<number> kilos each , huh ?

but she is real , it was n't just a concussion . 
but i have never seen this before . i am not complete . 
a few things came up . or went down . 
probably a little longer than that , but , whatever . 
but you knew this was important to me . 
can you hold ? can you try ?

nobody knows about your constant masturbation . 
oohhhh , <person> !

where 's the bullet ? 
<number> loud scream will bring them in here instantly . you wo n't get very far . think it over . 
okay .

we learn something new about ourselves every day . now . maybe i did n't make myself clear . it is very important that you tell me exactly what <person> <person> knows . 
i understand the business reasons . 
i 'd like to . 
thank you , your honor , i 'll continue . dr. thompson . did you examine <person> <person> <person> last night at the northern chronic care facility ?

it consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice . we try to oblige .

hey .

... her unbridled sexuality . that he ... 
then you can sue the cops . collect from both ends . tighten your belts . here it comes . <person> ?

if they 're not at the light , look for them . i do n't want them out there . get them back to port ! 
[ the car will not be powerful and have no trunk . ] 
<person> bought himself cologne ? 
pop , i 'm not ready to go back yet . 
lots of people . guy like <person> <person> , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government 's been investigating his links with the mafia . 
you did n't 
no ? 
<person> <person> ! it has brought him as much trouble as glory . help him to leave these troubles behind . otherwise , he 'll never be able to start anew . 
how long 's it gon na take , for you to drink yourself to death ? 
that would be the reason . 
i 'm serious . you do n't know me and i know nothing about you . we have a perfect relationship . 
possible , but unlikely . the angles are too extreme . a guy holding <number> guns to the back of your head is gon na shoot straight ahead . he would n't cock out his elbows , makes no sense . besides , you telling me <number> guy came in here and killed <number> men with <number> extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds ? no way . had to be at least <number> . 
<person> cale .

i -- i 'm quittin ' the pageant . 
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack ? 
he 's a plumber . 
raoul is cool . that 's all you need to know . 
the letter he sent . 
how is that possible ? you give concerts , do n't you ? i hear they are quite successful . 
what can we do ? 
with pay ! she is out the door . 
you know what <person> <person> said . a photographer always goes after a story . 
and i do n't just mean the sec . we could have the fbi breathing down our necks . 
what ? 
they 're serious . they 're cautious . they 'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery 's handled ... they 'd walk away , rather than compromise operational security ... that 's good . 
hey , be cool . 
what are you talking about ? 
adele ... are you serious ? 
he did know . 
good . 
he 's so brave . 
you 're a beautiful young girl ... i ca n't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me , except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity . 
constantinople ? 
that 's good : he earned it . 
the sick boy method . 
i 'm not bait . no way . i post today .

what do you want ? 
i had n't thought about it . understand me , gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing . it does n't bother me <number> bit , but i do n't get off on it . 
i guess so ... i know i felt something i never felt before ... and i did n't like it ... not a bit . i 'll tell you <number> thing ... sanctuary better be worth it . that 's the last place for me to live now . 
any words you do n't know you can find in the dictionary . 
<person> !

what shape is the scar ? 
when she saw the insects she passed out cold . i carried her back to her room . she was sleeping when i re- entered the tunnel to look around . 
now who 's being sarcastic ? 
you do n't want the extra police pay ? 
you have done well , and now i , too , have something for you . come . 
so you hop on to the next best thing ? i thought you were different from other guys . 
i mean , dammit , where you live ? 
i 'm home now . 
no , just do it real quick . i 'll meet you down there . 
they wanted you to tell them what you know . 
why ? 
that book is out of print , <person> , those days are gone . fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches ... 
<person> ' he loved the experience so much , i think we outta give him the pleasure again . 
you look like <person> , now . go up the stairs . 
i am a very serious gardener . 
<person> caswell is an actress . a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts . ah ... eve . 
`` the gang made off with thirty-five <number> dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land ! '' who wrote this ! ? i 'll see him hanged every tuesday for a month ! 
life is good . 
you 're crazy ! i 'm not gon na jump ! 
no . 
frank is going to kill .

that 's where you 're wrong , <person> . you 've just told <number> . a very good story indeed . 
good . well , you 've seen the flat ? 
we must examine you . 
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that 's just trickery and flummery . 
you followed me ! 
well <person> ... it was for ... ... saving your fucking life back there ! 
no , i have confidence in their loyalty ... but this is life and death , and <person> , you are my brother . 
what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche ?

not by touching , or shaking hands , or hugging , using the same toilet ... even kissing someone with aids is safe . but it there 's something in your past you 're worried about ... 
i 'm <person> . <person> . i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling , me that . <person> . 
officer , i can explain . 
look . talk . not talk . 
i 'm sure that 's all it is , honey . maybe you both just need a vacation . 
lis , i want to , i really do , but ... oh , i ca n't .

i respect life , do n't you see ? for each and every human life i have respect . 
the richest <number> percent of this country owns half the country 's wealth : <number> <number> dollars . <number> third of that comes from hard work , <number> thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do -- stock and real estate speculation . it 's bullshit . <person> percent of the american people have little or no net worth . i create nothing ; i own . we make the rules , <person> , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it ... ... you 're not naive enough to think we 're living in a democracy are you , <person> ? it 's the free market . you 're <number> of us now ... take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . i got things to teach you ... 
there 's nothing to tell .

you 're not listening to me ! you have to do something ! 
oh , there 's something wrong with you , all right . especially after hearing that dream of yours , about the roto-rooter . 
the phone just went dead . i called the police and ran right over as fast as i could . 
or perchance ... 
at home alone - where were you ? 
i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time . 
but the same song . i think it 's fantastic ! 
farmers were poor in those days , that 's what dad was - a farmer . i had to help out . so i quit school and i went to <person> . i became a secretary . in a brewery . when you 're a secretary in a brewery - it 's pretty hard to make believe you 're anything else . everything is beer . it was n't much fun , but it helped at home - and there was a little theater group ... like a drop of rain in the desert . that 's where i met <person> . he was a radio technician . we played 'liliom ' for <number> performances , i was awful - then the war came , and we got married . <person> was in the air force - and they sent him to the south pacific . you were with the o.w.i. , were n't you <person> <person> ? that 's what 'who 's who ' says ... well , with <person> gone , my life went back to beer . except for a letter a week . <number> week <person> wrote he had a leave coming up . i 'd saved my money and vacation time . i went to san francisco to meet him . <person> was n't there . they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee - the one that came from washington to say that <person> was n't coming at all . that <person> was dead ... ... so i figured i 'd stay in san francisco . i was alone , but could n't go back without <person> . i found a job . and his insurance helped ... and there were theaters in san francisco . and <number> night <person> <person> came to play in 'remembrance ' ... and i went to see it . and - well - here i am ... 
and what if it does ? 
if you were tore up i would not be claiming you . trust . 
so it 's sweet of you to be protective ... 
oh god , that stuff stinks . 
are n't you ? 
nothing . we made it to the hospital . i did n't have to go as far as i was prepared to . but i was prepared to go all the way . 
mary , i 'm a farmer -- always will be . to me seed is n't a thing to pay debts with , it 's alive , more alive than anything -- but i guess you 're right . we just got to do it . oh -- how 's it all going to end ? 
he said ... he was just looking for a good time . 
uh ... <person> <person> ... 
no kung pao chicken . never . 
my kind of people . 
you are not allergic of onions . 
i ride around nights mostly . subways , buses . see things . <person> 'd i might as well get paid for it .

why do i say that ? <person> ... forget it . 
the same . <person> as what ? 
well that 's that , then . i mean , i was worried about mug shot possibilities already . but now he knows : what you look like , what your first name is , where you 're from and what your specialty is . they ai n't gon na hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out . that 's it right , you did n't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection ? 
london . that 's a promotion ! 
crosstown . 
can you make a rehearsal in the morning ... ? courtland wants to ... 
i do n't mean believe , like believing in a religion . i mean , do you believe it has power ? do you think it could heal a sick person ? 
oh , you 're so much better than everyone , right ? no one 's worthy of you . 
then tell me how . 
what 's he doing ? 
stop . get away . 
now ? 
<person> 's ways are not yours . and you are not here to question <person> . offer him the salt of penitence . he will give you back the bread of eternal life . he is all merciful . that is all you need to know . 
me neither . 
hmm . i 'd say <number> , maybe <number> . 
a name ? 
oh . <number> hundred coming right up . 
he 's trying to get up -- good god , <number> of her titties is out !

in my room .

not much story here . just a bunch of kids cutting loose . 
when i retired , i swore i 'd never set foot on a starship again , and i meant it . 
the painless pole plans to cross the great divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out . 
i was thinking a graphic designer , mid-thirties , and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass . but i 'm trying to not be too particular . 
i got to fetch her home ... 
credit card . 
it happens . 
you did n't answer my question . 
it 's automatic . 
it ai n't your locker no more .

like what ? 
do n't touch those triggers ! please . i think i 've already proven that a live <person> <person> is much more better that a dead ... way -- gayle . i was your passport out of jail , not <person> <person> . but me ! i 'll be your passport outta -- - 
<person> said i should . 
you have to wonder . 
i 'd quit the army for you , if it came to that . 
there 's nothing they can do to me . 
what 're you going to do ? 
i guess . he went to the garage . <person> thing , he 's probably never seen such a crazy mess . he probably wants to go back and live in <person> <person> 's shop . 
diane , you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments , no strings , because after you get over there , things are going to change . people change . 
i caught you red-handed , <person> <person> . 
yea , art thou there ? ! 
let 's not talk about that now . 
a sad choice . 
i got to leave my post . 
i know what you mean . after a while they all look the same .

but i do n't want to meet your gang . 
of course , but you 've got no reason to think he 's bungled the case ? 
mind if i play some tunes ? 
good ! because , brothers , that 's you ! 
no , but it got you interested , did n't it ? got you to dig . <person> <person> to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they did n't belong . 
i should leave . 
may we proceed with the business ? 
what ? come on ... 
she killed him . 
did he just say what i think he said ? 
well , sure , i guess . <person> says so too . i work pretty hard at school . 
who said that ? 
manhattan . 
why are you mad ? 
i 'm wasting time . 
no , i 'm not . all i want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead . so i 'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail . 
... split . 
when they find it , they find it . 
fine . i 'll see you at the reception . 
i 'll ignore that . . . so , i created a monster who did n't work nearly as well as i might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy , more power . 
he looks at the girl , looks into her eyes -- 
home after . will you come in and say `` hi '' ? 
russian intelligence ? are you mad ? 
definitely some sort of fighting <person> , i think . 
stu ? stu ? let 's not disturb the nice reaper . 
i 've never loved anybody ! 
macey , i know you 're tired , but can you drop me at the retinal fetish ? it 's on your way . 
do n't worry , hon . <person> is here and he 's gon na help out -- just remember , you owe me . 
the driveway 's on my side of the house . 
dick , these boys want you to run . they 're serious . they can deliver the south and they can put texas in your column . that would 've done it in '60 . 
i 'm in a bad fuckin ' spot here . you know that ? bad fuckin ' spot . 
i knew you would . 
was that difficult to get ? 
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription -- 
fine , forget it . 
if i don ’ t get to the boa before he gets to <person> ’ s <person> , m is dead . 
me and you 'll drive down to long beach tomorrow . i 'll introduce you to <person> , tell him what 's going on . 
the hipster ! 
you 're not my therapist . you 're hear to study me . face it —— i 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you . 
yes , sir . 
would you ? because if you could n't , i would be very lonely ... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen . but none of this will happen . so it does n't matter . because we are on the guajira peninsula . and all you see around you ... look around ... is <person> de <person> montoya- londono . he is my man . and you are a smuggler moving a load ... 
it did n't go anywhere . but that 's not why -- 
she stopped eating completely ... 
well , i was n't nervous . 
i love you , <person> . i really mean it . i love you . come to the pantry . 
could we try it now ? 
sure . 
look , <person> - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you 're a boy ! 
no . 
yes ? 
it 's never too late to change . i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself . my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm , but i preferred the bayonet . 
i think the only think you 've left out are our relations with the soviet union . <person> , everything 's gon na be all right . 
in the building ... mary starts for the building , glancing once in the direction of the patrolman . 
do n't < u > even < /u > talk about that stuff ! 
i guessed . 
they 're awfully heavy . 
i really think that < u > business < /u > ... matters should be discussed between you t ... 
you 're responsible for your own actions and you do n't mean to hurt anyone . in other words , you 've done < u > your < /u > best . i 'm saying do n't carry the burden of < u > other < /u > people 's actions on your shoulders , because they 're beyond your control . 
<number> days . 
yeah . the dude 's in bad shape ... you see his hands ? 
neither do i . 
they 've started the battle without me ! 
i do n't think about it . 
is that her real name ? 
is n't there something you want to tell me ? 
sometimes . 
good day , <person> <person> . 
<person> , if that 's his best game , i can beat him . 
if you 'd like to tell me , yeah . 
man , i know these people in my goddamn blood ! 
captain who ? 
i did . 
michael ! jesus i 've been trying - 
i 'm using an old phonographic turntable . 
it gets interesting if it was <person> , because our word is that when <person> says something , he 's gotten the ok from haldeman , and when <person> says something , he 's gotten the ok from the president . 
excuse me ? 
come look at this . 
how did you know ? 
oh , i forgot to tell you . i registered as <person> and mrs . 
i 'm not afraid of you . you have n't got a moustache ! 
how nice you look . is that your uniform ? 
good morning , lieutenant - <person> . 
how you feelin ' , <person> ? 
almost certain . 
yeah . 
well , i 'm not going until i talk to you . 
oh , go on . 
so where do we start ? 
why ? ... why should you carry other people 's bags ? 
call me next week . we 'll talk about it . 
so if you give us the pregnant lady 's number , we can warn her about the lake and she 'll live long enough to have the baby . 
can we go somewhere and talk ? 
that 's not hard to do . 
uh , no . i missed that <number> . but what do i know ? i like <person> and hardy movies . 
it sounds stupid . 
you should keep track of your old school chums . turns out she eventually joined the communist party . on top of which , she 's <person> <person> <person> now , and she happens to be a writer for `` <person> <person> '' on cbs . 
and i disagree . 
bourbon and <person> . 
i stay in my own yard . 
living proof . 
i 'll explain on the way . 
want to kill yourself ? are you saying that you 're drinking as a way to kill yourself ? 
and we 're glad to have you here ... 
that poor boy 's a crack dealer from <person> <person> . we do not allow his kind on this block . 
i 'm sorry , i totally spaced . i just ... i did n't realize it ... 
damned if i know . she ditched me . 
oh , i see , i see . 
<person> ? 
it was my mother 's . 
shove it , <person> ! 
my pleasure . 
me , too ... 
did i do good , <person> <person> ? 
the cattle ! this valley runs down to a clear creek . that 's why we picked this spot , and that 's why they do n't want us here . 
what do you mean police dog ? 
i never went in that sphere . 
say listen , <person> . i got a new theory about all these suicides . 
i run the place . what can i get you ? 
sure , but i 'd like to handle it . 
ashamed ? no -- i love you , <person> . i mean that . after i leave them , i 'll meet you at the motel , okay ? 
of course , <person> . 
diz -- <person> <person> with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak <number> important words -- *willet creek* . when that happens -- if my hunch is right -- the silver knight will fall off his tightrope and <person> will jump out of his boots . 
frustrating . i had <person> almost ready to run , and <person> cut everybody with <person> <number> access out of the system . 
now look here , ma . i 'm not a boy anymore . i want that understood . i do n't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life . <person> 's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs -- 
oh , yeah , all the time . that 's what i do now . 
i 'm back in grand rapids . 
and no transmission belt for <number> weeks neither . 
that 's very enlightened , professor . it 's comforting to know that america 's children have you for a teacher . 
oh ? 
now you know <person> , and i know , what you need to be doing . you have a gift . 
michael ! ... 
sleep . that 's all i need . do n't want to waste no time sleeping . you married ? 
no , it 's the great and <person> <person> . now listen -- you 're in over your head . this is how it 's gon na work . i review the tapes , i find your story . 
wha -- what do you want ? 
what 's it for ? 
blind faith is what i consider heresy ! 
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you . 
people say he was a murderer . 
the truck ? 
you would n't be here otherwise . 
he shot you the other time . 
depends . who 's this ? 
oh , please . 
maybe once upon a time . but that was long ago . back before ... before it became what it is . 
well , i mean it 's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it . 
good example ! good example of what i 'd like to know ? he did n't even kill nobody ... he could n't do it no more . 
not particularly . 
yes , he 's tired . i believe so . 
you 're kidding ! like what ? 
yes ... 
that 's right -- i 'm at last going out on a date with the great <person> and i just want to be sure i 've picked the right t-shirt . 
dig . 
freezing . maybe a couple degrees over . 
he accused <person> of taking kickbacks . and you know – anybody who knows <person> – knows that 's a goddamn lie ! 
why do n't you shut up ! 
i can tell you anything else . 
why ca n't you come ... 
i hear she was a terror to work with . 
she did , huh . 
i knew this guy was too perfect . he was destined to have a flaw . 
oh , do n't blow everything out of proportion . 
budweiser ? you talk to me of beer and you 've the unbridled gall to mention <person> in the same sentence ? that 's not beer ! <person> , it 's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss . 
not if you count 'singing in the rain . ' do him a favor and do n't treat it like a tragedy . you want me to talk to him ? 
interesting . 
whose number do you need ? 
you met her . 
`` a '' ... `` n '' ... uh , `` d '' ... end of word . 
you do n't understand . i 'm just so < u > relieved < /u > . i was < u > sure < /u > you 'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy . 
a man , young lady ! <person> , such a man as all the world- -why , he 's a man of wax . 
<person> ruined my two-way . go to my place on the haul road , tell <person> <person> i 'm okay and to sit tight . 
i do ? i mean , yeah , i do . 
cynthia . <person> . 
yes , but as a black painter – 
this is an incredible breakthrough , <person> . a psychoreactive substance ! whatever this is , it clearly responds to human emotional states . 
your office is the workmen 's -- 
that 's it ? 
okay , i 'll - 
including you ; yes . 
i remember my wife dying . 
does she say so ? 
i will be in <number> months . i ca n't wait . i hate being eleven . it has to be the stupidest age in the world . 
like what ?

gee , i must have been shit-faced at your wedding , i do n't -- 
he 's never offed anybody . his rap does n't show any violence . 
that 's now . in an hour , he could have total recall . 
do n't worry , <person> , i wo n't tell a soul . 
wait a minute . <person> . hold it . <person> <person> 's making so much noise i can hardly -- 
yeah . 
that 's not true . i never met anybody named <person> . anybody who told you that has to be crazy . 
jesus , you 're sleeping with the guy . you 've lost your perspective . you ca n't possibly be unbiased . 
you do n't seem to understand that this <number> 's different . he has brains . 
i 'm sorry . 
-- instead of just waiting for their turn to speak . 
remember , a jedi 's strength flows from the force . but beware . <person> , fear , aggression . the dark side are they . once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny . 
what happened ? somebody step on your hands ? 
oh my dear child . 
i said shut up ! now who sent you ? 
i told you , try to stay calm . you 're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch . 
i do n't understand , where 's groppi ? 
it 's a rule . always stand by your first count . the odds are you 're right . 
you mean , me ? 
then we 'll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization . 
no . i do n't know where they are . i even called over at <person> 's , but no answer . 
how 's that ? 
look where ? 
to have achieved <number> 's ambition , or to have reconciled oneself to its limits , is a lifetime 's work . 
kid -- he thinks he 's talking to that mob at home , but not a line we 've written -- not a word he 's said from that floor has gotten into that home state . 
so , we get back on that rock and in <number> days we 're dead anyway . 
we 'll pick it up . 
i go to the police station and do my job , and you go back to being <person> <person> . 
-- they 're from umass , doing some kind of fucking term paper -- 
at least we 're rid of the damn monster . it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship . 
i thought the worst they would do is fire me . who knew they took termination so literally ? 
out-of-town . that 's all he 'll say . 
exactly . stoned mother . 
it 's as though he 'd trapped a real cuckoo inside . 
... who is this ? 
i 'll make coffee . 
i 'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage . 
cause i ca n't allow it . 
hmm , i should feel right at home with them ...

this sounds <person> as a weeping willow . 
you look okay to me , <person> . come over here and sit down . tell me what you been up to . 
that 's what i need to ask you . you know you ca n't keep anything from me . 
but <person> --

screw lamb -- let 's shoot the sirloin ! 
please explain to me , mickey , where 's the purity that you could n't live without in <number> year old <person> <person> 's blown off head ? where 's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and <person> ? what 's so fucking pure about that ? 
next to your father ? 
nigel and i do n't like each other much . 
get everyone out here . then call the sheriffs . tell them we have a possible hostage situation . 
why 
sidney 's father ? 
the contract ? 
mother ? 
i 'm telling you you ca n't . 
yes , sir . 
frida ? i was worried to death about you . i 've called you for <number> days . where have you been ? 
bring your rifles , that 's all . take us to him . 
well , she comes to see me . she was upset about a lot of things , especially that whole fuckin ' <person> - that <person> <person> incident . 
hmmmm ... well , the scampi sounds good ... 
it 's alright ... it 's airight . he 's gone , <person> ... gone . 
you 're a substance abuser , <person> . your pancreas was shot . would n't have lasted out the year . we did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain . 
<person> ii ?

with what ? 
no , no , no , no , i do n't wan na be stuck with the guy . i want the tickets .

and who would that be ? 
no ... here he comes .

what ? 
no way . i 'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me . 
... janet get my father on the phone and the <number> other union reps , urgent ... 
you 're inhuman . 
i was looking for a needle and thread . i was n't snooping . i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra . 
i should . i 've been doing it half my life to humans . 
it 's just that i 'm the kind of guy who ca n't say no -- i do n't mean to girls -- i mean -- 
i 'm glad . 
i promise . we 'll go on as soon as it 's light . 
i think anything you want to do , you 'll do well . 
yeah . 
what is this ? 
we 'll see you in a couple of hours . 
often ? he practically lived there . it was real cloak and dagger stuff . they called it operation mongoose . the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba . <person> 's office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas , through new orleans to miami , stockpiling arms and explosives . 
i want the vice president , secretary of defense , the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location . i 'm staying here . i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives . 
dammit , i 'm so sick of this . 
i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor . 
huh ? oh , sure . just pull the door shut when you leave . 
you do n't know him . i 'm so stupid . 
his last fight was his best , <person> . he and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of <number> small miner who stuck to his claim . you know , they tried everything , bribery , intimidation , then -- well -- 
but i am a captain . if i were not a captain , i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player , which i am , having learned at the side of my mother who is , by popular acclaim , the best poker player in ... 
it 's a lead mine . 
against . 
dad says ! 
i wish there was some way i could ... just ... pay the fine and go home . 
i have no hard proof of any of this . her address is also on the photos . i think these people are involved with drugs . and murder . i think <person> is killing drug dealers and . . and somehow <person> is getting all their drugs . i had to tell you i got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to , but it 's over now for sure . .i had to tell you about these things in case it could help . 
if you think <person> <person> will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze <number> out , then i think you 're misinformed . 
wanted to wish you luck . not that you 'll need it . 
you feel it , though . 
let my daughter rest in peace . 
how long ago was your makeover ? 
your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met -- 
your pay . 
that 's so good to hear , sweetheart . it really is . you know , i .. are you alone ? 
<person> <person> , son . 
wait a minute , what other agent ? what other agent ? 
well , lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i 'd kinda like to talk to you about <number> of them in particular . it 'd be a big help . 
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea ! 
i was n't dreaming . 
<person> 's day . that 's got to be a bummer . where did you get that date , <person> ? 
who did you talk to ? 
died in the bathtub ... if , in fact , he 's really dead . next . 
i do n't want you to go near her . she 's bad news . 
everything . just for the record . 
here 's my favorite . 
they got a sign on him in front of greely 's ? 
then get a move on . childs , come with me . 
you do n't have to tell them anything . we 're getting you a lawyer . 
oh , that 's great . we killed <person> because you heard him talk about some money that you 've never seen . that 's fucking brilliant ! 
he 's a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool . 
you were not dead before . when i thought you dead , i did not care about all the plays that will never come , only that i would never see your face . i saw our end , and it will come . 
i do n't know . you just seem really familiar to me . never mind . enjoy your meals . 
let 's hear him . what have we got to lose ? what 's your name ? 
another man 's life in your sights . 
i did n't know either . that 's why i told <person> to prepare your papers . 
basically , yes . 
are you neglecting my request ? 
minneapolis ... minneapolis ... 
i have a knack for designing clothes . but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook . 
you 're a superstitious fucker . 
what time is it there ? 
you know what would be cool is , like , to do a music video , you know ? but , like , you know , have it set in here . you know , like , like , like , with her and shit . you know , like , you know , like , `` closed , closed , closed , closed , closed , closed . '' 
well , nothing we can do about it . come into my house . you can stay with me , until i build you your own place . i expect you wo n't want to mix with the others -- not our type of people . 
maybe there 's a larger truth . 
a powerful man . 
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here , and i mean every little fuckin ' thing too . 
oh , i 'd say so . you married- 
seriously , <person> . 
like what ? 
on account of my schofield model <person> and wesson pistol . 
fuck him . 
yes , sir . 
my truck overheated , so i opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt . so i had to get a haircut . 
you 're a wonderful woman , darlin ' . as long as you 're around , i 'm sure the sun would n't dare go out . 
well , you wan na shoot < u > back < /u > , it give you a big < u > target < /u > ... 
yeah . me and my boy here are gon na be in new york overnight . i want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight . i 'm talkin ' a california style , <person> , gangster pool party back at the hotel . and make that drink a double . 
oh , hiya , <person> . 
oh , i could n't tonight . thanks a lot . 
no , i got time . 
not be safe ? what on earth are you talking about ? 
you should be here when they bring in a body that 's been dead for a couple of days , and they have n't found it yet , 'cause it was in an apartment , and no-one came to visit , or floating in a river , and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green , you know , like watery pea soup ? the arms and legs deteriorate first , the body looks like a raisin with <number> fat legs . anyway , this is why i 'm seriously considering cremation . <person> ? ? 
no ! 
we can be there . 
smells like it . 
you had to kill <person> ? ! 
<person> <number> of the missing victims from that boat deal . 
<person> , your blood-type is ab negative . there 's no way your birth father can be o positive . you father is not who you think he is . 
cool . see you guys tonight . bring food . 
<person> ? they lived together all their years ? 
oh , <person> was in my acting class . 
now 's not the time to be cheeky , maddy . 
your honor , i 'm trying to establish a pattern in dr. <person> 's behavior with women . 
yeah . yes . 
if it 's good advice . 
we 're not waiting until morning ... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight . 
if anything happened to you i 'd never forgive myself . 
if she is , the machine works . 
we better get word to the authorities and -- look ! 
what ? 
who is that horrible friend of yours ? 
<person> hinted it existed . it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms . 
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you 'd thought you 'd known . 
he 's not fine . 
any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls ? 
i 'm seeing something that was always hidden . i 'm involved in a mystery . i 'm learning . and it 's all secret . 
i 'm sure you 're right . 
i 'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with . you look beautiful like that . 
everyone that was invited is related to <number> of the staff who was here when the place burned . there are <number> of us ... 
oh , i 'm not blaming you . i just know me . i 'd be jealous . <person> of . . . of all humanity . some rival , huh ? 
it 's true . 
i 'll give you a gut feeling , you little ... hey ... < u > hey < /u > ! get that stick out of your mouth . these things are killers , man . do n't you go to school , listen to smokey the bear and all that ... 
as you please . 
oh my . you mean , some people are born and never will become putterers ? 
man or woman ? 
no ! 
he 's all doped up . 
you 're afraid of him . 
goin ' in . we got a sales convention . <person> ta be there tomorrow . 
yeah , i have to judge who can drive home and who ca n't . i have to keep their keys . 
i 'm taking off my mike . 
well , when <number> students are hospitalized with stomach cramps i think it 's newsworthy . 
yeah . 
sure ... 
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career , am walking around with a pocketful of cherry <person> & <person> 's ? 
jackie stop . we promised we never go there . 
would that add to your < u > mirth < /u > ? 
for what reason ? some personal satisfaction ? 
good to see you , too , <person> . 
perseverance . 
what is this ? who the hell are you ? 
you got to kid . let me spell it out for you . this is a whorehouse . and i happen to like my life the way it is and nobody 's gon na make me change . 
we can protect you . 
i could n't have another bite . 
he ca n't take much more time on the table . 
everything human do n't have to look like you and me ... . 
what ? ! 
of course not ... 
to experience beyond anything ever known . at least that 's what i was promised when i bought it . pleasure from heaven or hell . i did n't much care which . 
he believed it all went back to <number> night , when as a little girl . i watched my parents have this big fight , really big . i thought my mother was going to kill my father . then they went into their room and made up . and i watched them make love through the keyhole . 
oh , is he ? we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city . we 're fools to tolerate it . 
right , then ... 
so that 's what this is all about . we 'll get together and plan your curriculum . 
look ! why do n't you run out and play ? the sun 's shining . 
the elevators are still runnin ' . 
do n't be stupid , <person> . if he 's my destiny , then , obviously , he has to be alive . 
just the blood sample from the pericardial sac . 
i do n't wan na take over the family business . 
on account of me . 
uh , uh ! my boss is paying for this trip ... ninety percent business ... and he wants practically notarized receipts . i better sign in and get a receipt . 
if you need an excuse , there 's a bakery on the corner . there 's a shot it 'll open soon -- that way we 're not screwy -- we 're just <number> people who like warm rolls . 
what kind of condition are you referring to ? 
i 'm sorry , honey . 
y'know , brody -- for the first time in years it 's worth putting money into this town . 
i was going to fake it . 
tell me about her again . 
lieutenant . 
curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler . he 's not a thinker . 
nice . but right out of our brochure . 
oh , i know . she 's so sweet , she 's been so good to me ... 
you better check it , <person> . 
<person> that . 
we 'll see you next week , and if -- 
mebbe . 
looks to me like your out of business . now i want some answers . 
not necessary , but preferable . i do n't think he 'll be a bother , he seems like a most refreshing sort of man . 
i 'm going to help her . 
but i might not have . 
damn right i 'm scared . 
no ! do n't go . 
... <person> , is everything okay ? 
cut that out . just because i 'm married - there 's no reason for that . 
let 's make a deal . 
i 'm not catching a melody . 
they were in me . both places ... you know . 
... fine . 
is it that hopeless ? 
she never mentioned her father . 
eat me , sebastian . it 's alright for you to fuck everyone , but because i 'm a girl it 's wrong . well let me tell you something , i did n't ask to be a girl . do you think i relish the fact that i have to act like <person> <person> twenty <number> <number> , so i can be considered a `` laaaady . '' do you think i take great delight when i hear - `` <person> is so wonderful . '' `` <person> is a model child . '' `` <person> is going to make an excellent wife <number> day . '' i 'm the marsha fucking <person> of the upper east side and sometimes i want to kill myself for it . no , i do n't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer . so there 's your psychoanalysis <person> <person> . now are you in or are you out ? 
sal ! ... fourteen street . 
i do n't buy the whole recluse scam . how are you doing it ? what is it -- drugs ? blackmail ? mind-control ? all <number> ? what do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere ? 
calm down , <person> . 
well -- other departments are , yes . 
yes , quite . 
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure . but he knew <person> and wrong . oh , and we kind of messed around ... 
i wanted to see the white horse -- 
i think it 's possible . 
no , i mean 
he 's dead . 
yes . it reminds me of home . 
to get my guns . 
then how do i know this is your office ? 
just like your father . i lied to him . he thinks you came home last night . 
the room ! 
what did you see , <person> ? 
it was an anonymous tip . 
effective . but to tell you the truth , i 've lost my passion for work . 
do you really need this bed , lady ? 
why ? 
earl . 
you did n't , <person> . 
i 'll get ready , <person> . i did n't expect you this soon . please -- wo n't everybody be nice to everybody else while i 'm gone ? 
umm ... yes . back home . 
hello . you look at me as if you did n't know me . 
you do n't know that . even i can not see their fate . 
i guess everything we 've got to lose is already gone anyway . 
spoken like an author . <person> , i 'm not twentyish . i am not thirtyish . <number> months ago , i was forty years old . forty . <number> oh . that slipped out , i had n't quite made up my mind to admit it . now i feel as if i 'd suddenly taken all my clothes off ... 
julie thinks there 's a dead guy in the closet . 
and it got me thinkin ' . how fun it would be to share each other 's girl . 
this is absurd . 
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city . <person> leaves you the only psychologist in town . 
what of it ? 
thank you , sera . 
yes . 
i can be a good pig . <person> . <person> 's web . good pig . <person> . 
right . she had a friend with her . the friend took off . 
i do n't know . 
andersonville . they did horrible things to men there ... 
<person> <person> will teach me how . soon . 
... well , we do that < u > anyway < /u > ... 
sure i 'm sure . 
what are you doing here ? 
you did n't mind too much . 
i 'm sorry if i got you into trouble . maybe we do n't have to , you know ... unless you really want to . 
guys . give me the <number> fifty and go away . 
it seems to be causing a stir . what 's with the toilet paper ? 
... yes ... 
she mentioned , of course , that <person> expects to play the part ? 
love ? come on , i would n't call it love . 
yes , sir . 
<person> kune do ... now i did some research on that form of fighting , and i found out that <person> <person> <person> was a style developed by <person> <person> . did you know that ? 
i do n't know . i 'm all right . 
people have tried this before , jake . it 's never worked . <person> <person> and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it . last year , <person> got pinched in l.a . 
i need to find him kind of soon , <person> . 
fine man to fall in love with . 
yes , i believe so . 
: ... hearts . and to themselves in these days that try their souls ... 
hey , there was a lot of blood . 
or you 'll what ? can me ? 
what was it ? 
no one . 
no . 
i do n't want to talk about it . 
dumper , the man <person> <person> mentioned and <person> <person> knew and <person> <person> knew . 
yes . he traced her to that motel , out on the old highway ... 
my brother and i . <number> each . 
you do n't either . take a look at yourself . maybe you 're scared that someone might actually like you -- 
and to prove to the voters that the red menace is on the level , the sheriff has written himself <number> more letters , threatening his life . i know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings . 
not to mention , `` saved by the bell '' . 
you 're an interior decorator , right ? 
well , it 's a binary formula -- a precise amount of <number> separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work . 
you 're lying to me . 
who , for instance ? 
hey ! where are the brakes ? 
i ... see . i 'm not sure i quite get your ... point ... 
<person> divorced , i was n't gon na work for my father-in-law anymore . the fellas down here said they 'd back me -- 
i dunno . lie on the beach ? 
so you want to know . 
all right , let 's uphold it for another ten minutes . 
more than your friend . family . 
what do you want from me , <person> ? 
if that 's your position , then eighteen of your officers will die . <person> , if you hang me with my men . 
you do n't have to do it for a living . 
he was always so `` nice '' ! <person> was i supposed to know that 's a good thing ? ! `` nice '' is weird ! nice is ... what is `` nice '' ? it 's not cool ! i 'll tell you that . was it ever ? 
i ’ m sure you do ... 
you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now ? 
sounds like fun . 
an f.b.i . man asking me for a break . how droll . 
what do you mean no ? they can fly us home . 
well , i do n't know if that 's ethical . you see , all statements are supposed to come from me . 
where does everyone sleep ? 
-- separate , in the evening ... '' 
faster we get there , faster we get back . 
what about jewelry ? 
what ? 
standing by , <person> <person> . 
and if he alters it ... ? * 
you mutant bastards ... 
why should n't i be jealous ? 
right on the flight line ? 
maybe she got jealous of <person> <person> , too . 
fine ! 
yes , it is . 
who cares what you think . i want you back and that 's all that matters . 
that 's right . i ca n't understand a man who puts strangers over his family , a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure . 
no , jasper , nobody 's gon na kill us . 
i guess so . 
now put them together . <person> off , you bloody sod . 
i 'll take some lessons this time . i promise . 
what if you 're wrong ? you just said she 's the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ? 
there was this kid that i grew up with ; he was a couple years younger than me , and sort of looked up to me , you know . we did our first work together , worked our way out of the street . things were good and we made the most of it . during prohibition , we ran molasses up to canada and made a fortune ; your father too . i guess as much as anyone , i loved him and trusted him . later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for g.i . 's on the way to the west coast . that kid 's name was <person> <person> , and the city he invented was <person> <person> . this was a great man ; a man with vision and guts ; and there is n't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town . <person> put a bullet through his eye ; no one knows who gave the order . when i heard about it i was n't angry . i knew <person> ; i knew he was headstrong , and talking loud , and saying stupid things . so when he turned up dead , i let it go , and said to myself : this is the business we 've chosen . i never asked , who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business . 
but they did n't see it happen , they still have doubts . what we need is another body , and <person> 's bloody hands right next to it ! 
no ? well , where were you when that happened ? 
could anyone have gotten it from you ? 
he was thinking of you , <person> -- he asked me to deliver this . 
i 'm asking you seriously , <person> , a stranger ? 
i agree ; but <person> put us on earth to take that risk . 
something tells me this guy is connected with what 's happening , <person> , and i think you should do it and i think you should do it right away . 
go for it . 
yeah , yeah , <person> - i 'm sayin ' , we 'll stop for pancakes , then we 'll get laid . <person> think ? 
how much ? 
i do n't have a goddamned idea . 
actually -- i 'm not real ... hungry . 
humor me . eat it anyway . 
we was ... lyin ' . 
i do n't know . for the food business . i guess . i just thought , you know , we 'd sneak a big mac on mommy , like we used to . 
yeah . <person> . 
a portuguese boyfriend . sounds very `` cosmo . '' 
then what are you doing in park slope ? it 's a little far from home , is n't it ? 
they come with the house . 
need a hint ? 
love . who knows what that is ? now circulation , deadlines , those i understand . 
what 's the matter now ? 
know what ? 
what worries you ? 
it 's too late now . we must go on . 
fuck you ! if you 're such an expert on music , why do n't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song ? 
no . 
i 'm not sure . 
no , m'sieu ! 
did you like your party ? 
how does it feel , <person> ? going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table ? how does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves -- ? ! 
you said she was sitting `` back there , '' or standing rather ... 
what are the rules for a sweater vest ? 
she may try to kill you . 
but you 're the key . the one he wants to play the game with . 
the bags under your eyes . you 're an attractive man , but you need to take better care of yourself . 
what did he say ? 
`` applicant ? '' 
it did ? boy , did it ever ! 
here ? 
you must have been crazy . 
yes , he is like a clown . 
father , i -- 
we do n't have anything else to try , <person> . 
has she talked with you since prison ? 
you think you 're alive and safe , but you 're already dead . everybody , you , him ... everybody ... you 're all fucking dead ! 
big enough . 
hey , come on , big guy like you , cop from new york . you 're gon na be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla . 
we can prove that you 're not <person> <person> . impersonating a fellow cadet is a court-martial in and of itself -- 
i mean , why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ? 
she did n't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we 'd blow it 's head off . 
yeah , but do n't pick me up . my father may think it 's strange . i 'll walk over to your house . i 'll be there at <number> o'clock . 
you killed those other <number> . 
if i could go back to farming -- 
there are just <number> things i 'm interested in : love and death . for the moment , i have none of the <number> !

there 's no scar , you freak . the corvis kid made it up .

your guess is as good as mine , mate . i 'm here on another matter entirely . 
i swear to god . <person> <person> , am i lying ?

alice ... 
she 's been there since thursday night . 
you were right , <person> . you were right all along . 
but i love you , <person> . 
yes , hon ? 
thank you . 
yes . what do you think ? 
we 're only going <number> way . 
solid and genuine is not boring . <person> can be completely insane ... 
we could do that . i could be on my way to florida , and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out . 
i 'm a junior . 
did n't seem worried about them . 
you 're talking nonsense . 
nobody knows you hired me ? 
so it 's on the street . 
you tell me to start a union , i 'm blowing your head off . <person> stalling and get out of the cab . 
i know your height , your weight and your social security number -- you had mumps , you had measles , and you had your appendix out . 
marty , <person> and virginia are here . they had another fight with your aunt catherine . so they ask me , would it be all right if <person> come to live with us . so i said , all right with me , but we have to ask you . <person> , she 's a lonely old lady . nobody wants her . everybody 's throwing her outta their house ... 
i 'm in my underwear . 
get on . i 'll take you to him . 
come on , i was hamburger . you were porterhouse . 
i do n't hear anything . 
of course i did . he said he 'd file an appeal right away . you did n't tell me he was so good looking . 
on the repeater . 
i 'm sorry , <person> . 
we 're not going to a singing lesson , she 's just gon na start taking singing lessons . 
<number> of many people who would live a word with you . 
i do n't care , just get me there . 
wait a second -- 
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me . 
we will be happy to beam down . but first we must have certain assurances . 
a few times . it 's kind of an annual tradi -- 
death to all bugs ! 
it 's safe , try it , you 'll see . 
<person> on . 
i like an olive . 
what did i do ? 
i vouch for <person> . who 's his buddy ? 
if you so much as breathe heavy on them , i 'm out on strike . 
<person> levu . for how many ? 
they 're not very imaginative ? 
no , you 're very good at it . i 'm really impressed . 
was that <person> 's idea ? 
what 's the matter ? 
i 'll get you the papers tomorrow . 
that was my companion . she sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice , of course . 
if <person> controls time ... then all time is pre-decided . then every living thing travels along a set path . 
yes . 
these are odds of <number> to <number> . 
i 'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you . but you 'll be surprised how much you understand . the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words . 
i think water got into the electrical system . you ride me back to camp ? i 'll get <number> of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning . 
i 'm trying to slash my wrists . 
what ? 
he is , eh ? i 'll take a look . bring him in .

yes , he 's fine . 
what 'd he get ? 
i guess i am . just a little . 
okay . 
mexico . 
wow . 
you mean <person> put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered ? 
it 's going to be a long spring . 
he 's hiding something . 
once a week you like a gentleman ? 
the attic . 
mm . 
nope . no problems up the road . 
yes . i do n't think you should leave them in the hall , do you ? 
that 's <number> job , you told me a lot of jobs . 
yes . 
i 'm all ears . 
oh , <person> ! 
barely . 
what 's that , like a p.o . box . 
tell what you see . write it well , <person> , and make sure you get it right 
it 's only funny at camp birchwood at <number> in the morning at a tick hunt . it 's not anymore . 
a factor of age . 
i tell you , if we do n't stick together on this , you could find yourself first president 's opposition . du <person> <person> . 
so how 'd you get <person> to look the other way ? 
later . go back to sleep . 
please do n't misunderstand . i am grateful for your hospitality and -- 
i 'm told it 's worth about a <number> dollars , maybe more . 
it 's late , <person> . 
he 's like a great big bear . <number> bear ' ... 
i wou- i would n't do that if i were you . 
let me see you . take off your hat . 
oh , no ... women is all we got . 
i can make my own decisions . 
to prevent a murder . <person> or later , he 's going to contact you . 
uh-huh . and it 's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $ <number> ! and if you act now , i might even throw in some free lawn furniture . 
do n't worry about it -- i never told you what i thought of that memo either -- 
because all she thinks about are these guys she 's after and i just hate her she 's such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now . why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what 's the big damn deal ? i mean , it 's okay and everything , but i do n't understand when people let it control them , control their lives , why do they do that ? 
no ... let 's walk through the city . 
pest control . got ta do your apartment . 
`` went away . '' i like that . 
yeah , right . someplace in this dust bowl i can get something to drink ? 
yeah really . i 'm ... 
how is this national security ? 
i 'll tell you if you 'll look at this form . it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide . they said ... this <number> likes to skin his humps . 
it 's a soporific . 
a little . 
<person> <person> <person> . at least that 's something you 'll never have to worry about . 
this thing 's loaded with internal virus systems . you 'll fry like an egg in there . 
`` rumor : <person> <person> and <person> <person> are in love ... fact : true , but not with each other . '' 
he ran . i could n't shoot him in the back . i tried to catch him . he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen . 
i do n't < u > know < /u > you , i do n't < u > know < /u > your name , i do n't know < u > what < /u > the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall , but i 'm getting pretty fuckin ' < u > sick < /u > of this ! get it ? ! 
you know nothing about feelings , natural or unnatural . 
all right . the frequency is <number> megahertz . 
a long time . 
alright ... alright ... you 've saved my ass enough times . what do you want to do ? 
and - uh - i guess , 'goodnight ' . 
they 're punks . <person> . their brains are wired wrong . they hurt surfing because they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . they just want to get radical . it 's mindless aggression . they 'll never get it , the spiritual side of it . 
so you 'll dredge the bottom again . you 've done that before . the results were ... uneven . 
so you have no absolute proof that <person> <person> ordered you to detonate . 
tell me , and then you can sleep . 
stokes is pullin ' ah pants down . 
she 's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs . that lady said they were on the fourth floor . 
what are you talking about ? you never wait all day . you can barely wait until it ’ s light out . 
well , baby , i 'm <person> and it needs to be cut . but i do n't want to place you in that position either . 
what ? ? ? you lose your lease on a condo ? 
i 'm sorry , i been real busy .

i think he 'd cut his dick off if <person> told him to . 
why ? 
you have enough to worry about , angelo . you do n't need my problems . 
yes . 
i do n't see any ladies here . except maybe you . 
it 's nothing . will you trust me ? 
jos , please try and have some fun here , okay ? how many of us get to go back to high school ? you 're gon na have a blast ! 
you 'll be safe here . he wo n't kill in a church .

and what was tellin him your name when you were n't supposed to ? 
the hull 's imploding ! 
<number> of the leaders of the warriors of all red nations . <person> organization . 
look , i 'm no expert , but -- 
enchanted , madame . 
i think you must go now -- the key is on the floor . 
do n't start on me today . 
no , no . 
but do n't you think if we release it now - he 's only been dead <number> days - it might be better than if - 
hey , it 's the will . i , <person> <person> , of sound mind and body , hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters ... 
who , <person> ? <person> 's alright , he 's just a hothead . 
i could see she likes you . 
but nightmares are the common thread ? 
i do n't care . 
they got him to the hospital . he 's stable ... 
danny , please , we do n't want to know . 
are you kidding ? there were sparks between us ! this scarf is a sign ! 
i 'm strangely comfortable with it . 
dad , yes . and i 'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now . 
yes ... yes , i ... can hear you ... 
i doubt that . 
but i could be anybody . 
shooting . 
that 's impossible . you 'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact , i 'm counting on you -- 
i just wanted to come over . you know , say hi . i miss hanging out with you on school nights .

you may never remember at all . [ beat ] your mind 's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged .

the shit they pull , huh ? 
we 'd like to hire you . 
no , rose , he 'll help you . 
vegas ? what 'd you think ? 
all right ... but understand , i do n't like being taken advantage of . i mean you 're in there talking with your uncle and all ... this is embarassing . 
god damn you , <person> <person> ! you wanted a revolutionary army and now that we 've really got <number> it scares you more than it does the british ! 
what 'd you expect ? that 's his job . 
look , what i 'm trying to say -- 
give up , <person> . let these people go . at least you 'll have your life . 
<person> <person> <person> . 
<person> 's teeth , am i to suffer this constant stream of interruption ? ! what will you do in act <number> when he meets the love of his life ? 
yeah man . i 'm jealous . you 're always great , <person> . `` her name is g-i-n-a <person> and she lo-oooves me . '' i did say chicken ! 
the enemy is matching velocity .

it 's me or wallace , <person> . <person> 's third party is only going to help mcgovern . i need your support . 
are you serious ? 
yeah , i know . 
i thought it was great . you were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie .

a long time , with <number> man . 
when ? 
do n't you read <person> ? 
jesus ! i 'll kill him ! i 'll kill him . what did she tell him ? 
whatiya mean ? 
maybe in the next life , the world will not need a <person> <person> . 
all right , i 'll give ya a break . down that hall there , there 's an unmarked door on the left . go on in there and wait at the window . i 'll take this ... ... in the back and run it through right away . we 'll have you outta there in a couple minutes .

i 'll be there in an hour . 
i 've got a meeting ... 
i mean , your shoulders - and your arms - 
nobody , <person> . 
no , he was a toad . even more of a toad than <person> ... i just wear the ring to keep the flies away . <person> was the best thing i ever did , because i did it ! and i swear to you , it changed me . i 've been to rome , italy ! i sat every morning at the cafe sistina and had my cappuccino , and watched the pilgrims walk to mass , and no one can ever take that away from me . 
oh , but with the army behind you , you could become extremely political . not a republican by any chance ? 
you must be tired . it 'll wake you up . 
did i tell you ? did you listen to me ? oh no , no , you knew better did n't you ? no , it 's just an ordinary rabbit is n't it . the names you called me . well , do n't say i did n't tell you . 
and they went to the stockholders in new york . 
susan , you 're a hell of a woman . you 've got a great career , you 're beautiful -- 
bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new <number> in . runs like a dream now . 
they 'll give you a wallop . 
but you did n't hurt -- 
my dream . 
oh . you need a cappuccino . 
but <person> <person> , i meant - 
yes i do . that 's all i got . <person> and you , <person> . there 's no one else i can trust . 
why ? 
what is it , what is it ? what 's the picture ? 
he 'll eat potroast and like it . 
i ca n't believe she never told me ? we spoke at least once a week . how could she do that ? 
i know i got you into this , <person> , but it does seem to me that you ca n't care much for me if you 're willing to let me stay locked up for <number> hours . 
huh . 
... yeah , but the hosaka 's history . 
where do you want it ? in the face ? 
good . where are we ? 
yes , can i help you ? maybe a donut or something ? 
do n't get too cute . 
no , no , whoa ! 
now you keep out of this ! 
we 're only talking about <number> weeks . 
of course not . 
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns . if we do n't blow them - who will ? 
i called you last night . 
wait -- 
completely . 
maintain eye contact . 
i used to eat there ... really good noodles . 
what are you asking me for ? he 's so busy lately i hardly see him . and he 's been so preoccupied . 
sure you are . you 're just a happier woman , cause you do n't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire . 
no . 
good twist . 
why are you staring at my breasts , <person> ? 
you seen <person> <person> ... ? 
see here , child , when you have this pain in your back , where is it ? 
i was praying . 
because i owe you . look at that ... 
i think it was england . 
what 'll we do ? 
i 'll get a manual . and study it . 
looks to me like standard equipment for the department of <person> <person> -- 
how is central these days ? 
pal , you 're cooked . it 's over . what you did , who you were ... that 's done . i 'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow . 
i told him about your work , and he 's very excited . 
<person> ' <person> <person> land , that 's what it is . 
and who might you be ? 
<number> continued : 
i 'm scared . 
[ ok. you will arrive at columbus circle and <person> <person> at <number> . you will drive around the square <number> times . <person> will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to i.d . the car . ] 
my apartment . 
i dunno , but he 's gon na get creamed . 
enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else . 
the furniture guy ? 
in a minute . 
uh huh ... 
leave me alone . 
about what you said this morning . 
i must admit , <person> <person> , i had moments i was worried . 
no ! no ! do n't touch it . that 's a very important work of art . what the bloody hell do you want ? 
who ? 
i need the job . 
you do n't meet him in the audition . that comes later . <person> , hope . 
she 's our inspiration ! 
okay ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can i go home ? 
don . 
is this a bad time ? 
they 've knocked out the damn automation center . i 've got no control over anything ! 
it was covered with <person> <person> 's fingerprints , but none of his blood . 
what the hell is going on ? 
i 've heard you 've got the best coke in the states . the shit back home is pants . 
i 've saved ya life , gal . i can do and say whatever the fuck i want . 
oh , yeah ? well , how do you think i felt ? you were singing in bowling alleys back then . i told people you were a hooker ! 
he 's a vampire alright . 
what makes sense , is all . 
well , fine , fine . <person> da dee . and how 's it working ? 
lingerie is my life , sir . my mother 's got a shop in brooklyn , i grew up in it , from the time i could crawl , we carry <person> lingerie , it 's the best there is , it 's all i been thinking about since the invasion . 
hey , listen , baby , i 'm a star . 
who is it ? 
it happens . this is where you 'll be sleeping . 
and a *lot* of paper ! 
i made it work . 
i got some acid man . maybe we can drop some on the guards huh ? in their tea or something . 
no . 
you think that 's wise ? 
of course i am . 
it 's no big deal , it just < u > looks < /u > better carrying me . oh , you mean because i was n't carrying my purse at the time . 
what made you want to be a fighter ? 
not spar , i 'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting <person> for the championship . 
uh , hi . 
i 'm alright . go hide . this wo n't take long . be quiet . 
no i know ... i know i do ... but it 's always the same , you know ? grill the bun , flip the meat , melt the cheese ... it never changes . it never gets any better or worse ... 
parrots can do as much , <person> <person> . it 's all very nice , but i do n't see the point . you know they wo n't let him stay here . 
-- here ? ! where 's <person> ? 
i doubt it . and these <number> other people , did they hear anything ? 
that should do nicely . 
she 's very beautiful . she 's much younger than i am . and she 's rich , i hope . 
hey -- comrade ! over here ! this is <person> <person> -- the volga boatman of barrack <number> ! 
yeah . 
what if it 's not that she 's seen something ? what if she 's supposed to see something , but she just has n't been given a chance to see it yet ? 
i think you know i 'm serious . i 'll pay you if you like ... but i 'd like to see you . 
yes . 
the magazines are <number> thing -- but <person> ! why did we have to let her come ? ! 
right . open your eyes , <person> . you do n't know me . even <person> does n't know me . your <person> disappeared ... it 's just me now . 
no , sir . 
well all right , <person> . he looked at a piano and saw music . the fuckin ' guy was deaf when he composed the ode to joy . they had to turn him around to take a bow because he could n't hear the crowd going crazy behind him . stone deaf . he saw all of that music in his head . 
thanks a lot , <person> . 
he 's drunk . 
how old is he ? 
do n't lose hope yet , <person> ! 
i 'll let the senator tell you . 
i 'm pulling up right now . evacuate the fucking van ! plans have changed ! < b > ext . texaco station -- next 
how do i know ? but , they all got that `` witnesses for the prosecution '' look to me . probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted ... i dunno . 
you are the princess . 
he 's gotten involved -- 
and then we 're gon na do her right here . <person> ? 
i do n't care what he says . <person> , i do n't need to relive this . on television ! 
though nicer than most ? 
you do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this , of course , hardly ever happens , if at all . the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious . 
that 's because i blew it out the goddamn airlock ! like i said . 
what is real ? how do you define real ? if you 're talking about your senses , what you feel , taste , smell , or see , then all you 're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain . 
sometimes in order to see the light , you have to risk the dark . 
no . it is n't ... she would n't ... it 's like i must have done something wrong , you know ? freaked her out . just fucked up something good again . 
let me out . i have to talk to you . 
in the bag underneath . 
but a priest ... ? 
and if you do it wrong ? 
hello ? 
yes , i suppose so . 
<person> , the curriculum here is set . it 's proven . it works . if you question it , what 's to prevent them from doing the same ? 
... de profundis clamo ad te domine . 
i got my , my hands taped to the steering wheel here , there 's this guy , he taped me in the car , he 's back there somewhere . 
her left arm . it was numb . she said she could n't use it . said it had no feeling . probably from the drugs she was taking . i just thought i ought to tell you . 
it 's cheap , and people know to mind their own business . what have you got for me ? 
i 'm sorry , it 's just ... i 've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and ... sometimes it gets out of hand . 
suzie , <person> ... this is me , <person> , you 're talking to . we both know you do n't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit ... 
and i love my fans , of which he is <number> . wan na thank them for all my sundays , and of course my monday nights too . that about says it ... 
yes . 
but have i ... ? ever ... ? ! 
i knew you were lying . 
-- maybe she 'll come with us . if i tell her how important it is to me , i do n't think she 'll mind . do you ? 
i 'm gon na fuck you up bitch . 
hmmm ... she 's beneath me , i 'm afraid . 
hey relax , guy . let 's see what the kid wants . 
i 'm sorry -- i 'm on edge today . 
... well , i have the worst headache , i have to go find some aspirin . but , call me , let 's have a drink , i 'm under <person> <person> . 
yes . 
that 's because you 're too far away , <person> . 
she said to remind you that you 're having <person> dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz .

but i 'm thinking about getting some cats , you know , and then they ... oh , wait a second-oh , no , no , i mean oh , shoot ! no , saturday night i 'm gon na - gon na sing . yeah .

your old beau ? 
he was very polite , worth the entire <number> dollars . 
ext . darlene 's store - night . 
it still does n't mean ... 
you hurt me , you know , when you made <person> 's choice . does that not even matter to you , you pig ? 
comrades ! good people of france ! 
yes , but is n't midnight a little excessive ? 
ok. <number> last thing . is there any anger in you ? any anger in your work ? 
i was in hell . if i called you ... if i heard your voice ... it would have been so easy for me to quit . i could n't do that . 
so what did happen ? 
got ta keep an eye on her , that 's all . 
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again . so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the <number> you 've found is back again . 
i threw that filthy thing away -- i do n't know what you 're trying to prove with it , but -- 
<person> andy , disapproves of my coiffure ? 
<person> jeff . i 'm feelin ' so much better . 
sun 's gettin high . 
good night , <person> .

just in case i do n't have a chance to say goodbye , i want you to know that i have n't spent so many pleasant hours for many years . 
i 'm saying that since i 'm doing so much better -- which i attribute to you -- i 'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings . 
but i do n't have that any more ... ... all that 's left for me now is the room upstairs . 
i 'm coming . 
slaves are made in such ways !

yah , you bet . it 's in the lot there . brand-new burnt umber ciera . 
yep , you guessed it . 
there 's another stocker , right ? 
a piece of ass would n't kill me . 
he must have been pretty sure i 'd come . 
why ? 
right , <person> . 
that 's their explanation . you might not believe me ... 
aubrey knows more about us than you think . 
right . call me <person> .

if they 're more advanced than us , they should be nearer the creator for that reason ! 
i 'll kill them for blowing up my railway ! 
how many came ? 
i understand . 
`` your movie '' -- i am so sick of that ! it 's your movie -- but it 's his life ! did you ever think about that ? ! did you ever think about that old man and <person> having to watch as you tore them apart ? ! 
<person> max , i made a terrible mistake . <number> i 'll never , ever make again . <person> and i are soulmates . i know that now . she 's the woman i want to spend the rest of my life with . i guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that . 
so ? 
you know what they say . if you have to ask -- 
yes . oh my , i suppose i should call them again . they said <number> o'clock . maybe it 's the traffic . i 'll call . would you mind waiting ?

i need to see you . 
he hired you to build this place ? 
yew-cheen chef-faw ... emphasis on the 'cheen ' and the 'faw ' ... 
we talk different ? 
the elders have , of course , thought long and hard about that question . 
there 's nothing to expose . 
we walked all night ... 
you could 've broke it to me gently , you know ; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend . i told you i have a girlfriend . 
give me an example . 
you listen to your voices , i listen to my heart . 
he was here ? 
what the hell am i doing wrong ? just because jake is training , i ca n't go out ? what am i , a goddamn prisoner ? 
i never wanted to hurt anybody . in fact ... i even thought i was helping .

oh , okay . 
a field trip ? maybe i 'll join you . see you tomorrow . 
uh huh . 
i guess so . you 're a doctor ? 
i admit it . 
here at starfleet ... ? the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock ... 
oh , yes , indeed . i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection . the debating society , the first eleven , the soft know of willow on leather -- 
what are you talking about ? 
let 's walk . 
what ? 
<person> <person> <person> ... 
because if anybody 's givin ' you trouble , <person> , i can take care of the problem ... like that . 
she 's not all that homely , <person> <person> . in fact , she must have been a rather beautiful young lady . 
i did n't want you to know i was coming . you heard what happened in my home ? 
yeah , so ? 
yeah ... but you 're not dying ! 
it was okay . 
there is a name , a term for your kind , the likes of you . back in slavery days , you would be classified as a house nigga . 
come on dorothy . 
the kind where there is n't really an answer . 
nothing . 
of course i like children . 
what ? ! that is not allowed . my god , you are supposed to be <number> of us . you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself ! 
people pay good money for that ? 
you know , i 've never got that shit . what exactly constitutes third base ? 
but <person> ... 
because a lot of people would 've gotten killed . probably all the wrong ones . 
he knows something 's up . 
why are you doing this to me ? i 'll give you whatever ... 
of course . 
<person> thought `` ca n't '' was n't in a man 's vocabulary . 
no . should i ? 
of course , we 're gon na need some < u > water < /u > , uh ... 
please ... this solves nothing ... please ... . 
and your arrest . you 'll each get about <number> years , i think . 
of course you do . and the only shot you 've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program . 
well , i 'm onto something more useful . you ever hear of a man named <person> <person> ? 
then we 'll never make it . 
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door ? 
no . 
plus running the opium concession for the whole <person> <person> . 
you were . i have work to do . the publisher wants the transcripts by monday . go . make yourself at home . 
looks like he talked to <person> <person> ... and to the times . told them he was dead set against the bombing , that you were ... `` unstable . '' claims he has to handle you `` with kid gloves '' ... 
do n't get too cocky . 
ohhhh -- 
what 's that little air bottle on the machine ? 
citizen kane there 's your title . 
all right . no . that 's nice . 
they 've still got to be able to sign his name . 
is she saying this in albanian ... ? 
not unless you can raise the dead . 
just loud enough to wake me up . 
a small thing . nothing really . 
uh , no . how do i get to <person> <person> ? 
he will be hidden somewhere out here , probably somewhere low , in the crowd . he 'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank . 
well , that sounds fine to me . 
there is <number> . 
we 're having a wet bikini contest , and you just won . 
when did you umm , i mean umm ... 
did you need it ? 
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny ! 'aged in wood ' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- 
a unicorn 's been slain . the last stallion in all the country . 
yeah , we all stayed at the four seasons , man . it was party time . hey , i hung out with <person> , <person> 's manager . <person> nice guy . we talked about the video . they want a raw look . something fresh . <person> said if i can capture the reality of burnfield , it 'd make a great tape . 
uh huh . 
how early ? 
we 'll have to check , <person> . it 's a pretty long trip to mercury . 
come on , <person> . you know this is n't easy for me . _ <number> . 
i did n't mean it the way it sounded ... 
did he ask you to take your clothes off ? 
i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . <person> , i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he 's so ... agaanisish ! 
well , you 're real sweet to make it for me . there never was nobody like you . and you do n't need to worry , i ai n't goin ' out no more . 
he got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food ... no bill of sale or nothing . it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped . so we do n't get anything on the seller . except i actually managed to find this guy , <number> hours on the phone ... say thank you . 
and ... ? 
right . 
well , ruth shoulda built it a little better . <person> thing 's falling to pieces . <person> na hurt somebody . 
time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin .

i 'm going to finish what <person> and i started . i owe him that . <person> , i owe him everything ... . i 'll get something important done for both of us ... . 
emi in london . i work with <person> . 
but <person> <person> is dead , is n't he ? 
eleven a.m . they 're gone . 
and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print ? 
do n't hildy me ! are you going to let him out ? 
hi . 
you said it again ! 
goodbye . 
we have new `` guests '' for the park . i have a file on them . may i see <person> ? 
oh , what , in this section of town ? 
wherever you like . here i 'll give you the money i won , <number> thousand <number> hundred . later you can have more . 
sure , but let 's finish up with this first . 
you try to be nice to people , when they 're rude about your singing ... 
you 've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator . 
why do n't ya tell <number> you 're a fan ! 
dead . 
i had no choice . 
we 'd be all alone . we could do anything we wanted and nobody would see . 
sassy my foot ! i 'm jus ' sick and tar 'd a my folks tryin ' to bust up . all we got lef ' in the *worl'* is the fambly -- an ' right down at bottom that 's all we *got* to have ! ef some of us dies , we ca n't he'p that -- but ai n't nobody else runnin ' away ! 
and do what ? 
he 's dead . whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now . 
he 's top man in astro and nuclear physics . he knows all about meteors ! 
you 'll see nothing of the kind , sheriff . 
tomorrow 's a full practice day ... but the day after is kind of open . 
you may have to find yourself a new line of work , this one does n't seem to agree with you anymore . 
what if he ca n't ? 
mars ? what are you doing ? 
<person> ? 
he 's real all right . 
i know . <person> <person> -- in the mortgage loan department -- last night he had a little halloween party here -- 
i would n't say that . but at least you 've put the camera to good use . 
tommy , thanks for coming over . 
these guys are n't the kind that 'll take an apology . they 're the kind that 'll break my thumbs . 
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up . 
you woulda ? 
forget it . it was ... fun . 
i do n't know . 
yes . 
... that you do n't remember getting pregnant ... 
i see <person> because i want to . i see <person> because he ca n't hide the warmth he has inside him . 
-- your employer ? 
and what it that ? 
what if - what if sumpn goes wrong ? 
they always pick <person> up early on thursday . 
just so . granted . and so you take your experimentations to <person> <person> and catch the murderer who has tainted the place . bring him here to face our good justice . will you do this for me ? 
what kind ? 
just stay down . 
no , but <person> does . he likes him . says he 's a good italian . 
like a party for all our friends . 
what did you say to her ? 
amazing ! i do n't know what to say -- 
`` i want to tell you something , <person> ... '' 
call the police . 
regards to her majesty . 
it 's not the same thing , is it ? 
that 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams . 
there , there ... shhh ... 
<person> davis . 
i did n't say that . you are n't marriage material . 
see you tomorrow . 
i am sitting . 
number <number> . i saw the yellow man come out . this time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase . they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance . number <number> . now get this . in the distance was a murder . a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken . 
yup , that 's right . <person> prom ... kinda . 
you do n't just dismiss <person> <person> . the man held <person> 's chair at princeton . if the event <person> had worked , he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since <person> . 
what is it ? 
pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant . 
no . 
i love you , <person> <person> . 
<person> me , selena . the hardware store does n't bring in much now , but ... 
the war is over . senator nole just ended the war .

is this the only way ? 
come on , daphne . 
i am desperate to see africa- but i hate the leaving . 
i 've heard this argument before . it 's not happening . 
i want you to follow <person> <person> . 
like that piece of ass he was with . 
look here , just because mrs. <person> asked you to amuse us . 
yes , but why ? 
you are , <person> . you rolling ? 
int . brynner 's van - night . 
i do n't know . 
i pack up and go somewhere else . 
that 's why we came here , remember ? 
we 're trying to scare them , not kill them ! 
i needed a pilot 's license to take the job here , so i got <number> in <number> weeks . 
the only thing i could think of would be ... you 'd have to get rid of the queen . 
why do n't you leave me alone ? 
the job thing would have broken us up , eventually , anyway . she could n't have lived with it . i know that now . 
violation ? 
right . 
what 's the point of a revolution if it does n't ? 
that 's okay . i -- 
we 're not ? 
someone will talk to your daddy . and then he 'll stop doing those things ... the things you do n't like . 
do n't tell me i 'm not a fucking asshole when i know i 'm a fucking asshole ! 
except for prom . 
who asked you ? 
her doctors killed her . 
that 's not the way to get ahead in life . 
we was born to die , boy . from the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head . you just do n't know where , or when , or how . do n't make sense worryin ' about the particulars . 
i could reproduce any miracle that 's ever been performed , with a little preparation . 
sure , you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake . 
sure . 
oh . well , you 're ... certainly welcome ! 
we just do it ... we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do , i guess ... 
reasonable ? good , i 'd like to meet a reasonable man . why do n't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner ? 
you what ... ? is that on the callsheet , is that on the callsheet , or is that < u > personal business < /u > ? ah , <person> . < u > <person> < /u > ... are we < u > paying < /u > you ?

you talked to your supervisor lately ? he 's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . that on top of the cops bugging him . 
i thought you wanted me here ? 
i do n't care about bucks . i might love this guy . 
no . 
yeah . 
i suppose we ca n't prevent that , <person> -- -- for auld lang syne . 
ca n't live with them , and you ca n't shoot 'em . 
for entering the afterlife . 
my legs are frozen . 
do n't say much , do you ? 
cheap ! cheap ! it 's never been more valuable ! and i 'm ruined ! ruined ! 
the light was fading . huh-huh . 
you 're not being charged . it 's up to you . do you want to talk to them ? 
unfortunately , <person> <person> , that is precisely where our opinions differ ... are you familiar with the work of aristotle ? erathostene ? ptolemeus ? 
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden ? 
the point is , the modern world is a jewish disease . 
yes . i like to watch very much .

let 's make it <number> <number> dollars a game , <person> . c'mon , <number> <number> dollars . that 's my bankroll , my life 's savings . what 's the matter , <person> ? all you got ta do is beat me the first game and i 'm on my way back to oakland .

look , if you really wan na score some dope , i got the guy . 
i 'm losing my faith in humanity . 
well , a ball player . 
typical psych major . a complete wise ass . and how 's your project coming ? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation ? 
i sort of do . but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality . cleaned up enough to be erotic . 
keep trying ! 
just so i understand ... you 're `` thing '' is ... acting like an idiot ? or is it actually being an idiot ? besides -- 
what ? because i 'm a little understand ...

you 're right about the old man . his power 's long dried up . he 's supposed to be a medicine man but he wo n't go see the people . he says we changed , and we do n't listen . well , he do n't go out and talk no more . i have n't had a drink in <number> years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar , and this hoss is gettin ' watered . 
unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up . 
the bathroom . look at how clean it is . the one in our cabin is clean ... but this is clean !

you know what i want to hear ? i want to hear that you do n't love me . if you tell me that , then i 'll leave you alone . i wo n't ask any questions and i wo n't be in your life . 
i know . let me just say this : <person> was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had . 
fantastic ! a little faster sweetheart . 
i took the other road . i 'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation . i love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone . and you ? 
it 's time you started working on your interviews . 
<person> ' , nobody 's bothered but you . look around -- they could n't care less . 
we understand you 've been going through a rather trying time . 
`` bazoomer < u > dot < /u > com . '' 
oh please..you 're on some sort of holy mission ? 
why ? 
beeeee careful . 
i need some security . i do n't trust you anymore . 
how do you know he 's telling the truth ?

i think not ... no , i 'm sorry . it was very sudden . he was here very briefly . 
there was a result to what you did . it was n't just another expedition . it did this . if the british had n't unearthed your nosey photographer in cairo thousands of people could have died . 
i can tell she 's not a killer . you just do n't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation . 
of course . 
to what ? 
why do n't you read it to her ? it worked for nuwanda . 
<person> , pard . would n't want you to get an honor violation . 
i 'd do the same . well , catch you thursday . 
hold on ... 
you and me , <person> . what a team we 'll make . we think alike ; we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . you wo n't regret this , <person> . 
gon na walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms . 
counsel approach the bench . 
yeah , that 's a funny story . 
well , you know , `` the whole thing 's theatre ... '' 
mantan ! ! 
and what happened ? 
just wanted to let you know you 're sitting in my chair . 
but there were more of you ? 
i know the rogue , <person> . <person> <person> <person> . 
of course i do -- but it 'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small -- 
: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game -- 
it 's okay , really . 
goodnight . 
i do n't think it 's negative <number> . 
no . thank you . 
i think you 've been skulling out too much . first nursery and now stupid questions . 
say hi to naomi . 
i 'm gon na nail it . 
i dunno . job satisfaction , i guess ... <person> 's things at the tip top ? 
nothing . 
tell me about it . 
for africa . 
i know you . i saw you through the floor , did n't i ? 
they grow outside , do n't they ? 
you sound like my mother . 
and uh , your nicotine sir 
i do n't think so . do you ? 
well then , let 's agree to disagree ... now how about a picture for my scrapbook ? 
yeah . i just wanted to thank you for that message last night . it made me feel like ... like less of an asshole . 
telling him is the long shot - i 'm going to take it . 
okay so ... what 's the safest place ? 
<person> -- i 'm getting leery of this guy . we keep calling him dumb -- and he keeps winding up in our hair ! i 'm telling you -- when he finds out there 's a dam going up where he wants his camp , he 's gon na start asking questions <number> ways from sunday -- 
in <number> , the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran . we wanted his oil , so for the shah 's birthday , the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press . the only one to ever leave the country . <number> years ago <person> <person> bought that press on the black market . 
... what ? ? 
oh , so i 'm the bad guy now ? 
then he 'll borrow it . i know <person> better than you do . even if he has to work another <number> years to pay it off , he 'll do it ! 
the argies . 
never pass up a good thing , eh ? 
where are you going ? 
no problem . i 'm not in a hurry . 
yeah , i know . more careful . 
by color . 
what 's the difference ? 
huh ? 
ben , the money 's not important . we could < u > save lives < /u > . 
where is it ? 
moss . 
you know <person> , i myself dabbled with pacifism at <number> point . not in nam , of course -- 
i think she 's pretty , <person> . 
c'mon , <person> . <person> has n't been impressed with anything i 've ever done . from winning my fifth grade spelling <person> to the present . 
maybe we should knock first ? 
i 'm just some big clown to you , ai n't i ? 
it 's not like you 've given me much choice . 
we 'll have to satisfy them . what would you say to giving them a joint interview ? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects . 
there 's nothing on the show i do n't use myself . 
sure ... 
mexico . 
you use it justly , you 're worthy of it . 
i 've heard your mother on <number> . the woman 's session has lots of lively debate . 
aw , you ai n't seen nothing yet . 
she says that <person> is still in the casbah . 
for starters i 'd like to know why she left the house and did n't report the death ? 
i 'm a grown woman , dr. emlee . i can take care of myself . 
i 'm still <number> ... . 
who 's my pal ... ? and what are you , <person> , huh , what are you , <person> <person> ? who the fuck are you , <person> <person> ... ? what are you , friend to the workingman ? big deal . fuck you , you got the memory a fuckin ' fly . i never liked you . 
we 're crossing the threshold ! 
i 'm a writer myself , you know . 
you know what they say , lieutenant . careful what you wish for : you may get it . 
kind of trouble i 'm in the mood for . 
what ? 
are you staying ? 
what about <person> ? 
nothing doing ! ! i 've taken a lease on the battlefield . i 'd lose my deposit , besides , i 've already ordered the ammunition ... 
it was bo , <person> <person> 's man . i hear he followed the thief to the yus ' . 
my god ! we bust him out of jail , in the middle of a riot , and he stops to take a -- 
shut up . i 'm playing . oh you wo n't regret it , young girls do n't forget it , lost in their own wilderness ... but it 's all so easy -- just try a little tenderness ... 
you 're an actor . find the zen in the role . 
well , the night is young . did you straighten out the chair situation ? 
good enough for <number> - <number> would look suspicious ... killed while attempting escape ... now that 's convincing for both . 
no shit . 
sure , they did stuff , but nothing like this , <person> . <person> <person> , the break-ins , the enemies list . you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution , planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace , trying to slip lsd to <person> <person> . 
kara and <person> never showed up tonight . we 'd better go home and check on them . there 's nothing else for us to do here . 
terrible . i 'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting . 
randy somebody . 
mmmmmmmmm ! 
all right . i 'm looking for a young fella , full of juice . about my size , wears a fancy two-gun rig . 
it just is . 
maybe ... 
yeah ... 
intriguing ? 
you must be thinking of a different daughter . 
but you were n't . i could tell . 
do you mind ? it was a real scary comic . 
it was <person> . she says the plates are in the soft count room . 
what do you mean ? 
nooo . if i could just have a roll , i 'd be okay . 
good for you . 
... you < u > are < /u > an orphan . 
honey , you 've made < i > <number> < /i > mistake -- 
there 've been some calls . 
a homo ? 
we really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything . 
i certainly will . 
there 's nothing to say , <person> ... 
i can imagine . you said you wanted nothing to do with this . you swore to me . `` do n't come near me . do n't bring this into my life ... '' 
what is wrong with you ? 
<person> will have my head for this . 
look how gracefully they conceived that arch . like a bowstring . it was built from both ends . with no support in the middle . <person> . 
well i guess we 're neighbors for this trip . 
are you crazy ? why would i pick you ? you 're a murderer . 
you got ta hit it here . here , <person> , not there . 
well if that is pete i am ashamed of him . the way i see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a babylon . these things- 
what 's on your mind ? 
should i ... 
they ... 
my fault ? ! if you had n't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- 
they wo n't . that 's not their jurisdiction . 
i 'll regret it even more if i keep you on . 
i do n't know , either . i want to find out . i 've never been hit , have you ? 
your <number> birthday . the transformation will be a perversion of christ 's rising from the dead . townsend discovered it in <number> of lareaux 's books . 
leave him . 
in some situations . 
i 've been thinking about it , that 's all . 
i do n't want to have any conversation . 
finally , there was only <number> answer to a man like him -- the truth -- which i rose and gave to this body ! <person> president -- he has told lie upon lie -- every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt . and now , he is trying to blackmail this senate -- as he tried to blackmail me ! to prevent his expulsion , he would probably even try to hold up this deficiency <person> -- vital to the whole country -- which must be passed immediately -- *today* ! *anything* -- to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide ! gentlemen -- i -- i have no more patience with this -- this *rascally* character . i apologize to this body for his appointment -- i regret i had ever known him . i -- i 'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and i refuse to listen to him any longer ! i hope every member of this body feels as i do ! 
eddie , we 're in show biz ! it 's all about razzle-dazzle . appearances . if you dress nice and talk well , people will swallow anything . 
working at woolworths . 
not long . we should arrive in the morning . are you going to be alright ? 
no , you smiled . 
i 'm on a diet . but thank you . 
i 'm not convinced you should be happy . 
nothing , nothing . 
because you 're a loser , and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth . 
not our problem . 
why backdrafts . <person> fried <person> and <person> went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire , but also made sure the fire blew itself out . 
did you used to ? 
all i ate was fish . that 's solid protein . 
because i love them , but they drive me crazy . you know how parents are ? 
well , yeah , but -- 
* well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and i 'll be right up . 
that was a good <number> , dad . that was really something . remember that ? 
-- bullshit -- 
well , then , it 's all good . yo , day-day , something is going down with those mexicans across the street ? i 've been seeing a lot of activity . 
or do you just want me ? i 'm going to let you enter me now . 
dr. winkel . 
no ! 
i do n't know what i was saying . i totally phoned it in last night . i have n't been getting a lot of sleep lately ... 
it 's not what you owe < u > me. < /u > time is so fleeting . <number> day it 's gone . you make it out of this alive , <person> , you really should call her . that 's what i think . 
what do you want to do ? 
babalouey , you were perfect , i could hardly keep from busting up . 
do n't be embarrassed , <person> . i heard it , but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i 'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling . 
like i 'm outside in the rain 
it 's a mess , ai n't it sheriff ? 
yeah . they 've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts . have any idea what this land 'll be worth with a steady water supply ? about thirty <number> more than they paid . 
well , yeah ... you know . 
i have an excellent teacher . 'make sure you wear the uniform ' ? 
how young ? 
... he told them to look at me -- look at me close . that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make , that i was n't the kind of guy to kill a guy , that i was the barber , for <person> 's sake ... 
i 'll take a bus . 
i do n't know ! why are you asking me ? how can it take an hour to find an ambulance ? 
i would n't be trying , beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing , all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ? 
as in `` death , where is thy sting ? '' he killed at least fifty men , wounded hundreds more . 
do you remember your epictetus , that little homily we recited when we were children ? the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans ? 
i need to know how <person> get built . who 's responsible ? 
was—but— 
he 's not even aware of it . when you 've got his attention you feel like you 're the only person in the world . that 's why everybody loves him . other times ... 
look , i hate to be the kinda nigga , does a nigga a favor -- then bam -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return . but i 'm afraid i got ta be that kinda nigga . 
twelve ! i 'm on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than <number> minutes . report to me on the enterprise in <number> hour . 
you 're too good for the small-time , <person> . <person> up to where there 's big dough to be made , and you do n't have to stick your neck out every day . 
have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ? 
after all these years of blissful silence , i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be . 
oh , an imaginary one . i used to hike a lot through the woods and i 'd always take this girl with me so i could talk to her . i 'd show her my pet trees and things . <person> kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it . 
you want me to stop the car ? 
who 'd you think it was ? 
hot ? hey , they 're not even room temperature . 
would you do us the honor of joining us ? we 're just sitting down at mess . pork chops and gravy , cranberries , baked potatoes with all the trimmings , fresh- baked bread , apple pie ... 
maybe later in the week . first i 've got to find myself a job . 
where is it ? 
what would you do up here ? 
real 'quality-timers , ' hugh . 
man ? 
sra-i'm-sick . <person> - kiss i 'm - my kiss my ! sra-i'm-sick - kiss my arse ! 
thank you . 
my parents have money ... 
can we do any better ? 
oh , right ... 's fine . thanks . 
no wonder . for starts , you should know that hot pants are < u > horrid < /u > , even when you do have the legs to carry them off . what are your plans while you 're in town ? 
just wait ! 
i do . 
i knew it . what does she know . you want me to sing something ? 
why did you do this ? 
we invested in these factories . in vancouver . 
do n't give me that shit ! i know you 're still a virgin ! 
recording , sir . we see you perfectly . 
you do n't have to make conversation with me , i 'm not my mother ... do you have a thing about older women ... that 's sort of faggoty is n't it ? 
i am . i 'm so very proud of you . go back to sleep . 
you moved ? 
because i can deliver the actual noc list . the <number> you have is not only worthless , it 's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location . 
oh , yeah . they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out . no expense account . no place to live . 
no joke , lieutenant . 
we do n't look on it like that . 
well . 
does n't < u > begin < /u > to describe it . i mean , you 've got cancer , < u > this < /u > is serious . 
that 's ridiculous . 
what did the thermometer say ? 
thanks for coming to get us . little brother almost scared us to death . 
it really is . did you find anything ? 
he 's in charge . 
-- what makes you think i 'd stick my neck out for <person> ? 
i understand . that 's already been taken care of . now you appreciate i can only work with the raw material i have at my disposal but for a little extra ... i could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability . 
we do n't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy . i know you 'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us . 
you 've been bitten by a vampire . we 've got to try and burn out the venom , just like a rattlesnake bite -- 
you invented <person> <person> ? 
`` how would you like to have the story , you big tub of—of— '' 
are you finished ? 
perhaps . 
pretty soon i 'll be making a move . 
they wo n't . he 's taken human life , the mission will be to put him down . 
and what if the broadcast dishes on top of <number> are n't hot yet ? you said the place is n't finished . 
no ! 
so <person> had handled it . afterwards , <person> picked it up . there 's no indication you handled it . 
right , good . tell you what , we 'll wait right here . till you get back . 
why do you like to fight so much ? 
i wonder , if <person> 's fix swings it for me , what 's heaven really like ? 
i know you 're thinkin ' that i got more'n some of my mama in me ? well , i could n't help it . <person> , i really could n't . i 'm sorry for that guy , but when he pulled that drippin ' hunk of awful-smellin ' meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies ! 
my life is in the shitter right about now , so if you do n't mind , i 'd like to stew a bit . 
my shift ends at <number> , but i could n't -- 
okay . thank you , my friends . 
no reason . it 's only , i just happened to look behind us , and something is there . 
<person> lieutenant i did n't ask for this job , i ... 
... here , and the white house is screaming about chemical weapons , and we 're ... 
so am i . 
you 're being weird again , see . come on . please do n't be weird . 
have you found your man ? is that where he is ? 
i 'm sure you are . 
yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , i heard all about that . 
ricky . my little boy . at least here we 've got a house . and i 've got a job . <person> , i 'm only a secretary , oaky , but it pays the bills . except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up . i even had to pawn my diamond ring then . 
yes . 
you miss the good ol ' days . even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they did n't have to . and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat . those good ol ' days ? 
why , i could n't do that . . . ! 
i love you , <person> . no take-backs . 
a private joke . 
time to start talking . 
you do n't have to finish tonight . 
book . sunglasses . <person> . 
me ? sing ? 
you have no idea what happened . . . 
i wo n't forget this . 
her mother told me most of then before she died . i dug out the rest for myself , here . 
i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ? 
i do n't want you hanging around there , hear ? 
yeah , well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post . somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama . there 's a story here . i know it . you got any tape or glue ? 
died ... 
not if you go . 
okay , now you can move your men into the mall , replace <person> 's people . <person> , tomorrow you take a couple of clemenza 's people and go to <person> 's apartment and wait for him to show . that crazy bastard might be going after <person> right now if he 's heard the news . 
i do n't care about americans . arrest them all if you have to , but keep those records secret . 
well , i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us . 
how old is <person> ? 
no tricks , no mirrors , nothing up my sleeve . it 's on the level this time . 
i 'm not . believe me . < u > i 'm < /u > scum . 
so , then , you ... and your husband ... must have called friends , relatives , to tell them the amazing news . yes ? 
tell me his name , dr. lecter . 
to bail <person> out of jail . 
we 're gon na scare him ? ! 
i know ... but you do look so silly . 
curious ... very curious ... . 
<person> , are you going down , or you want me to ? 
yeah . i know i did . but ... i 'm tryin ' to be dif'rent . i 'm tryin ' to ... get some peace , you know ? 
it 's some kind of energy field . we better record this . 
could have been drunk a little sooner , but excellent ... good character ... what is it ? 
i 'm glad it 's you and not <person> . 
i 'll take a jar of that , too . 
they know i broke in . <person> helped me . <person> 's not <number> of them . he 's blundering into this on his own . 
he 's ... he 's very nice . but mrs . <person> , the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands . <person> , you have to help me . 
no . 
then why in hell 're you doin ' this ? you ought to be in bed . 
man , i am out of here ! this family is so fucked ! 
am i invited ? 
it sucked . 
you gon na wipe your ass dis time ? 
or mud carriers . 
he did n't know . no one doing the deal knew except a few key people . this guy says they were real hush about it . whatever it was it was highly sensitive . 
it cost me <number> hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley . 
okay , here 's what i think . we find out what all the subway stops for that train are -- the subway system 's really not that big in rome , we could narrow it down and -- 
i think-i think there 's too much burden placed on the orgasm , you know , to make up for empty areas in life . 
-- that ? -- 
it 's long and personal . it has nothing to do with you or the other kids . 
everybody has a story , <person> . 
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone . 
<number> can not love and kill . 
<person> doran ? <number> floors up , <number> window over . 
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow , no drugs in her system , no foul play . 
word 's out on you , <person> . you walk in the wrong kind of place and they 'll eat you alive . 
like a lowjack , but <number> generations ahead of what the police use . it pulses at <number> giga-hertz . 
anything like work aroun ' here ? 
oh , have n't i ? the money -- mrs. lampert -- the money . the $ <number> <person> <person> received from the auction . those <number> men want it , too -- they want it very badly . 
hey , bud . what 's your problem ? 
you got me . 
it 's like eighty degrees in this hallway . you from the south ? 
they just sort of leave me cold . 
he 'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut . did n't think he 'd be so bold as to take all of it . 
hello ... is this the spanish consulate ? this is <person> <person> <person> . my husband and i are leaving tonight for <person> ... is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? thank you , thank you . how long will it take you ? 
i like her already . 
but for what reason would she have wanted to go away ? 
make it so . 
tom , you startled me ! you 're back . 
do n't worry about what will happen , just concentrate on what is happening . you 'll live longer . 
yes . 
'bout a year ago ? is <person> still alive ? 
i do n't know ... like fifty . 
you have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty ? did they drink my whiskey ? 
what ? 
this is a lot worse than `` betty . '' 
ya hear , <person> ? she thinks this face is cute ? hey , whatcha doin ' now ? you wan na go for a ride ? 
if you 'll come down the street i will make you a cup of coffee . 
yeah , she went blind giving birth to me . she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me . 
okay , now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective ? what the hell is going on ? you got no discipline in your operation . 
is it true you 're impervious to pain ? 
i 'm sure you do . 
it does n't work that way , kiddo . you do n't know squat about the dynamics of marriage . 
it helps me to focus . it centers me , helps me think . 
golly -- i 'd like to see all your horses ! 
did you fix the damn film ? it broke in the last reel . 
uh , ma'am . 
that 's because i am . 
i could give you reasons . her silence . her youth . it 's forbidden to make so young , so helpless , that can not survive on its own . 
a sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for . 
brilliantly . <person> for a pint ? 
do you recall my instructions to you , starling ? what were they ? 
what do you think ? 
that you guys should n't be here . 
i thought you were sixteen . 
i show you . come . you come . <person> have special , crazy fuck . that right ? 
clyde . 
you could always disappear with what 's already in your backpack . 
no , it was n't , it was intentional . 
you think he 's goin ' home , makin ' a beef behind my back ? 
yeah i left him with the car ... we 're all squared up now . 
well , i 'm home now , so you can go right to sleep . c'mon , angel . 
being as close , i 'm certain you 've noticed what we all have noticed . 
they 're a lot stronger than i 'm used to . 
you can both go take a flying jump . 
oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home . 
sure , <person> . it 's a firmware construct . 
... piece of mind . 
then that would be eating and drinking i 'd live like a prince without thinking . the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman 's much better than wine ! then that would be eating and drinking ! the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman 's much better than wine . she 's much better than wine ! she 's much better than wine ! 
i 'm not trying to sharpshoot you , but that 'nothing lasts ' stuff , that 's what was the trouble with <person> 's guy . he was fooling around and <person> caught him at it . <number> girlfriend was n't enough for him . 
you should go back to her . 
but you , you 've had them . 
i guess still in the locker . 
jackie , can we -- 
who 's weak now , big brother ? 
yeah ... well , yours . you still do n't believe that you 're the princess , do you ? 
yeah well , they want a lot for their money . they want a felony , preferably with `` violent intent . '' we 've got to give them something . they 'll kill me if i do n't . and the panthers are going to kill me if i do . i 'm scared . 
i know , i was wrong . but <person> , <person> , we got to get out . 
yeah , everybody thought so . but me and <person> got a kick out of toons . all toons . we could n't see the bad in 'em . and when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the first national bank of toontown , we took his case . but when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . we went to his house to take him in . but he was wise . he got the drop on us ... literally . 
i do n't have the strength to fight off la <person> ... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier . 
not right now , <person> 's asleep . 
can you handle it ? 
whoa ! heh heh . hey butt-head , this chick is pretty cool . she says there 's gon na be tons of sluts in las vegas ! heh heh heh . 
you and i -- a relationship . 
<number> o'clock . i was having dinner . 
when do we get to drink it ? 
no problem . in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat . 
say what you 're gon na say . 
well i do n't think there 's a chance of that happening . it 's usually the moon walks . sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher . 
on your `` permit , '' but that is less than a formality . 
runway niner . it 's the longest , and directly into the wind . 
of course . 
it 's a three-hour flight . they shoulda got there yesterday . 
maureen . 
maybe i just live here , what do you think about that ? 
do n't worry , you were quite rude enough . do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine ? i 'm sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best . in full possession of your faculties , at least . 
the government 's afraid , and they do n't know what to do . but they 're more afraid of terrorists than of you . the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence . 
< u > no < /u > . i keep getting hit with heads ! 
he 's gone to dinner ! search the place . i ca n't think why you would imagine <person> would hide from you . 
no , it will be too much distraction . i do n't want that many people in the water . i 'll go in , give it a belly shot , and get out . 
i 'm on the brink of bankruptcy ; my husband 's resources are all but exhausted . and to what end , i ask you ? 
to change our minds . 
are you lovesick ? 
say you were wrong . 
... is death . 
the car broke down . 
take it easy ! 
wait a minute ! when did this happen , that we 're partners ? 
do n't look like there 's a right way . 
bailey , <person> . 
energize ... 
i used to know how to cook . 
oh , no , you wo n't . 
guess he took off ... you have his keys , right ? 
we were going together before i ever let go of you . 
shhh ! do n't make him feel worse . 
relax , i got him . 
it 's <person> . you 're on the air . 
may 've noticed chains do n't work on this guy . only way we 're truly safe is if he believes he 's goin ' free . but if he < u > stops < /u > believin ' -- 
tough . 
i see . let 's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines . now you think they do n't exist ? 
who 's there ? 
i know ... i still ca n't get over that his name was `` seymour . '' 
were n't there high schools in el salvador ? 
you 'll let me go now ? 
hi . hi <person> . i 'm sorry to bother you , but i 've got to talk to you . 
. yeah ! 
ohhh , i ca n't bear to watch . 
i do n't want to talk about it here , <person> . 
you 're not gon na kill me ... 
well , <person> 's dead , so shut your fly trap . 
harcourt is dead . 
mr rothstein . 
i live here . 
i 'm fine . come on , we have to keep moving . 
i dunno .. i guess this is staff side of the building ? 
alfred , am i pigheaded ? is it always my way or the highway ? 
damn , you 're beautiful . 
sir , is there anything wrong ? 
i 've finished my circle and i have n't picked up any life read- ings . 
christ ! you do know it all ! 
theo , i want you to know , you 're probably the most decent man i 've ever met . 
i do n't know . had dreams . 
ah , hello . my name is <person> <person> ... and i 'm here from <person> <person> , indiana . ah , listen ... somebody stole my handles . 
baby , we 're gon na be up by <number> hundy by midnight . <person> , baby ! 
i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours . 
sure you could , <person> -- but you would n't want to do that , would you ? you would n't want to kill anybody . 
well what the hell did you think was going to happen ? 
how is he ? 
never mind . just do it ! retrieve the arrows somehow . 
we got a phone , here , that 's got a little ring . 
yeah , right . 
ohh the tag is broken . 
i do n't remember that <number> . 
yeah . 
yeah , well i would n't expect too much . 
so we should set out a smorgasbord ? 
suit yourself . but does this mean anything to you ? 
i -- i want to say ... 
i am a doctor . i teach medicine . 
that goo . that stuff that tastes like soap . 
... spring and summer ... yes , i see ... fall and winter . yes , indeed ... could you go through that <number> more time , please , <person> <person> ? 
good . 
[ no . whoever took the rest took it before the exchange . ] 
no . do you ? ca n't be too hard , can it ? i do n't think we should be here out in the open like this . 
<person> <person> left the bar with <person> on her own . 
my mom says i 'm gon na grow . 
they think i 'm a crooked customs agent . 
yeah . he 's a `` rounder '' . 
where else am i gon na go . <person> <number> grand on rocky . 
take me home -- and forget you ever saw me . that 's a silly remark is n't it ? 
good . <person> . yeah ... wow . <person> <person> . seems like a <number> <number> years ago now . 
how soon will you be able to decode it ? 
it nibbles . you see this ? 
i do n't think so . <person> 's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it . 
where is he , before we beat it out of you ? 
she wants to give you your money . if she did n't , there 'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now . 
this evening is over . 
what happened ?

what the fuck is this , <person> ? 
you think i 'm improving ? 
did n't feel like whoopin ' it up with the rest of us blue collars , huh ? 
hey . 
this welsh dude is tripping on ruiz cause he 's a shot <person> . 
<person> . 
i was sort of wondering what you looked like . <person> down . 
a yert . <person> is a living legend , <person> . at a time when most women are in boca , having early bird specials -- she 's working so her husband can be in montana . in a yert . 
were all these people questioned this afternoon ? 
why n't you buy a san'wich ? we got nice san'widges . 
it 's the same way with cars . different cars . different tunes . you ca n't steal a maserati listening to sinatra . you got ta get urgent . you got ta get <person> <person> or <person> <person> <person> , on that shit . but never , never-ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car . could lead to disaster . got it ... ? 
new orleans , huh ? ... we was just there . 
but he was called ... 
we felt his presence . 
no problem . 
you reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back , <person> . 
shut up . have you got your passport ? 
about the dumper , did n't he tell you that ? 
but they wo n't want to take you to trial . they 'll offer you simple possession , a few months of county time , and a year or <number> probation . how 'bout another ? 
i did n't come here to get my palms read . i need something translated . 
but ... inside , i have seen- 
yes . as soon as you get into this business , all you can think about is getting to the top . that 's all there is . until then , there is nothing . you are nothing . 
he bought you that ? 
i know the feeling ... 
chapter and verse . 
it 's a crematorium . 
i intend to make a great deal of money off you . 
the mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed . there 's only <number> way out and you 're doing it right now -- just keep talking to us . i think we could make the transition now . <person> , you good to go ? 
well , anyway , it 's *something* like that -- and it *is* important . that -- that steering committee has *got* to see it that way . and i 'm sure senator <person> will do all he can -- he 's a fine man , <person> <person> , is n't he ? he knew my father , you know . 
tell me about <person> - 
you coulda stayed at bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now , <number> of going off and bein ' a salesman . 
to keep from being an old maid . 
i guess those people do n't wake up to tell what happens . 
i have no idea but it looks like a long way . 
beats the hell out of me . 
did she have tits like that ? 
i do n't get the distinction . 
<person> ' i forgot to do . i 'll be back . 
not word <number> . 
he would have been back by now . 
i got , uh ... . 
what should i have told you ? 
what about <person> ? 
no ... i believe `` heinous bitch '' is the term used most often . 
yes . 
cynthia . <person> . meet me at my house in exactly <number> hour . 
you need to get out more . 
it 'll be so good for you , and for <person> , because you know , you 've never really ... 
wine ? 
well , in that case , could n't you -- ? 
she says my whole body 's a mistake . 
i 'll show you what i 'm doing . <person> , you 're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning <person> . i 'm going to see that the post is fined ten <number> dollars for this . 
i can try . 
i 'll protect you , dollface . 
now , so am i ... what 's so interesting about him ? 
i know your parents . 
good . how long will it take ? 
what are you talking about ? 
what ? 
let 's go . 
but we made a business deal . 
i know the type . lives in the basement , smells like a sponge ... 
i 'm hardly that , <person> <person> . 
so anyway , these <number> federal marshals meet the plane , and they take our address , and they ask us never to fly with 'friendly skies ' again . 
my whole world . 
so great -- right ? 
the point of fedex , as i understand it , is to make the damn connection . 
they fired me . 
i collect spores , molds and fungus . 
why ? you act like you did n't know <number> day this would happen . 
it 's him . he 's got california plates . it 's the same guy . 
do n't worry about it . 
sure , dad . 
i know only that he is a killer . and i shall bring back his carcass . 
nope . no maps . <person> , huh ? on vacation ? 
must be . <person> 's busy . i 'll send <person> ... 
where can we go ? i ca n't go back into that zoo . 
oh , no , man , look . look , you know , it 's me , okay ? i come out here and i 'm , so used to everyone , you know , kissing my ass and i think i 'm a fucking star , man , and i 'm really sorry if i 'm full of attitude . i , i really ... 
croissants . 
billy ! i 'm gettin ' a vision ! you 're the next one ... 
that 's the breed ... course it might take time . 
come on ! 
for the sake of your argument , let us say that is correct . 
you think so ? 
we are trying to stand out . right near his address . easier to get them to come to us , than to try and find them . ..now keep your eyes open , something might present itself . 
must be what we came for . the <number> stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the waxworks , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms . the <number> are now roaming around the waxworks individually , with tony encountering what appears to be a tribal indian pointing a knife towards a victim . <person> walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zombie-fied creature . we see china walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman 's mouth . finally , we see tony walking up to a cottage room display . 
did i ? i 've been waiting for that for years . 
all finished . 
how come ... ? 
i hope not . now , as soon as you do what i told you , have plan-r radioed to the wing . 
ya , that rack holds <number> ties . 
it could have been worse , <person> . it could have been a lot worse . 
i never really thought they 'd go for it . and then ... you did n't come forward , they investigated my war record ... i kept expecting you to show up and expose me ... 
tell dad we 're getting married in las vegas . in <number> of those chapels . he can meet us there . 
<person> came early . 
he 's no magician . 
hand it over . <person> plot ? 
and the chopsticks and fortune cookies ? 
i thought that 's what i did . who was it that you talked to ? 
well , that 's the big question , is n't it ? 
do you expect me to believe ... ? 
far out . <person> malt ? can i pick it ? 
to say the least . 
why did he kill himself ? 
you promised me an explanation . 
i ai n't waitin ' , <person> . i 'll look in on your youngsters when i get back . 
hey , i got a staff to pay , plus rent , plus i have n't billed a minute of my time since i started on this case , so you can quit hitting me up like i 'm rich or something . 
no , you did n't . 
come on ... 
let 's just go sailing , okay ? 
unfortunately no , these americans are smart , they pay me only half now , half when i get them back to cairo , so i must go all the way . 
you 're not falling asleep , are you ? you could drown , you know . 
yes sir , i guess that 's true smallest room in the house . 
it 's okay . 
you know , i just might ! 
i 'm sorry , <person> . 
because somewhere ... in <number> of those memories ... is the evidence . if i got in far enough , i could reconstruct it . 
i played the cards i was dealt , <person> . your problem is you 're always trying to play someone <person> 's . allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free : there is no happiness , <person> there is no normal life . there 's only life , that 's all . just life . the rest is relative . 
no . i mean back to your home . 
what 's all this sweet talk about florida ? your friend o'daniel got a stable down there now ? 
oh , we 've all disappointed her . me , especially , but dad , of course . she thinks my brother 's all right , but she did n't expect much . it 's what happens when you `` marry beneath yourself '' ... 
an ' that 's why you did n't want 'em to look ? 
there sure is . 
and do they believe it ? 
i like having the car , the car is important . 
yeah , yeah ... 
tommy , <person> night is when you play tricks on people and scare them . it 's all make believe . 
they do n't know . it was carefully planned . earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie . 
well , <person> tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the air-conditioning system . 
mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year ? <person> ... 
do n't you have a kiber crystal ? 
bullmastiff . 
yes . 
oh , i was just wondering , if i were to bring in chirino , would you put me on the task force ? 
no i do n't . 
yes ! 
damone ! you come here ? 
i think that about covers it . i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though . that 's got to hurt , i imagine . that 's got to smart a bit . i mean strictly in my observer 's capacity it seemed you <number> were getting on pretty fucking famously . 
rizzo ! can you hear me ? ! 
vaughan is n't interested in pedestrians . 
this i got ta see . 
you think ? 
thanks , <person> . 
that 's right . so why do you take it , sweetheart ? 
do what ? ! <person> -- ? ! 
right , that synchronizes here . <person> , bomb , arm yourself . 
i 'm tired . i want to.go now . 
the fastest . 
perhaps a small amount of money . how much do <number> of your motion pictures cost ? 
he did n't give me a chance . look , honey , do n't get upset , but he 's not taking your case . 
okay , i guess . 
you 've got enough people kissing your ass . 
embolism in her brain . yesterday . 
and not even then sometimes . 
mydick . 
you heard me . out of here . 
i do n't think so . she 'll want <person> first . 
oh yes , i play with them ... lots ... 
do n't you go to jail for that ? 
pg & -- are you sure ? 
<person> . you <number> will be together forever . 
are you sure ? 
well i 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night . 
yes . 
there 's enough for everybody ! 
<person> said a lot of things . 
it 's a veddy small island in de <person> <person> . it sunk . george oh . hm . i 'm uh , sorry . well , look , i 'm probably out of my mind -- but i think you 're very interesting . if you ever need representation ... we should talk . 
i ... uh ... i do n't know . i guess do n't like to think about it . 
thank you . 
why ? 
you were n't really interested in suez at all . <person> enough , you were interested in my wife . 
actually -- in this dream -- i was your mother . 
am i right or am i right ? 
jake , i mean , come on -- 
oh , lucky him . 
when ? 
we send the gold up what 's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here ? 
right . 
he 's a-carryin ' me to look fer work in millsburg where i was borned . 
uh , huh ... she said she had a good job , was playing a lot of tennis . she wanted to know all about <person> . 
yeah it 's okay . you know , we have a saying back home : `` either the salt is rotten or the meat . '' 
as you know from speaking to phil , your friend <person> has disappeared , rhian . his family have hired me to find him . 
are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ? 
i 've got something to talk to you about , and the least you can do is listen . you owe me that much . i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you , and i 'm not going until you 've heard me out . 
eat 
i want my money . 
it 's a ketch <person> and i had chartered . 
oh . 
a rather large contusion , but i do n't feel there is any serious damage . i 'd like to keep an eye on him , though - i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days . 
people come first , dr. isley . 
heading true north . we continue in that direction . 
he knows me ? 
you have to have a favorite . 
there is n't anything you can do . 
who speaks spanish ? 
take grain away from the army ? 
well , my career takes up a lot of my time . 
i do n't see why . i 'm twice as old as you are . how could anyone think -- 
lisa -- i ca n't guess what you 're thinking . 
no <person> , you ca n't . 
oh , you need me now , yes , now you need me ! 
who 's that ? 
you know i do n't like to watch talk shows by myself . where 're you ? 
hey . it 's raining . 
ahhhh ! 
intuition . it does n't make you yoda . like tonight . you killed that guy tonight . but i knew you would . 
we 'll convince them . 
you 'll never get away with this . 
the `` skylight ? '' fool ! it 's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight ... 
all night ? 
what ? 
... but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase , okay ? i understand completely that it 's just a tv show . there is no ship , there is no <person> <person> , no diagital conveyor ... i mean , obviously it 's all just a- 
seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of bangkok . should have seen his rose garden : blooms the size of hand grenades . 
okay . <person> , you 're a good boy . 
yes -- 
it 's all we 've got . 
kramer ... 
i do n't need a turn ! 
your father does n't like me . 
far as i know . 
you were saying you do n't want a <number> dollars . 
levi ? who names their kid levi -- 
had the boys follow us . 
indeed , yes , those halcyon days . 
but the idea 's good , if we could just turn it around somehow . 
get it in the stacks at the library of congress , now . who 's seeing the guy at c.b.s . ? 
take her up to the suite . have a glass of champagne ... or <number> ... i 'll be up in a while to help you ring in the new year . 
fine . while i retrieve my diamonds , you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair . she 's frozen in - 
those are ancient history . 
you betcher ass , dad . 
yes . 
if it 's the tall man -- he had <number> of those hair transplants . <person> , you know . it still has n't grown fully in . the other <number> is from the islands . <person> hair -- very dark . 
that 's marriage . 
i just feel like some part of me has n't healed up enough to go back . like some critical piece is missing . please understand ... 
i ... i 'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army , sir . 
noooo ... 
who told you that ? 
gear . you know , clothing . 
let me go , <person> ! 
harmless ! 
yours , or the turkeys ? 
what 's wrong ? 
<person> <person> <person> just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules . 
i had a female vagina last night . 
... you think this thing wants to become an animal ? dogs ca n't make it <number> miles to the sea . no skua gulls to imitate this time of year ... no penguins this far inland ... do n't you understand ? ! it wanted to become us ! 
we got it back , that 's all . 
eddie , let 's see that blotter . 
i 'm getting to believe you . 
i 'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow . the patient 's rooms are down here . 
you thought i meant ... too tough to apologize , huh ? you must have been a very lonely girl . 
nursemaid ? ! 
and then with <person> out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars . or maybe two-thousand . or twenty-thousand . who 's to stop you ? not <person> <person> , 'cause old jake would be dead . 
you told me you 'd say that , too . 
there 's a <number> dollars in there , maybe < u > <number> < /u <number> <number> . i 'll give you half . 
i do n't know , <person> . i do n't know if the helicopters can land in here . i 'll have to check it out . i got superiors , unnerstan ? they do n't always see eye to eye with me . i 'll do what i can . 
yeah . 
all i told them was the truth . 
better than most , i suppose . 
what does old <person> want ? 
you ca n't seduce me . 
we 're outta motion lotion . 
you know of them ? 
no , <person> . i 'm not related to <person> and <person> . 
let him break - he likes to break . 
i 'd have been long gone . 
well , yes . yes , in fact . a little on the outside , yes . and there 's been all this friction . 
i lost sight of everything . forgot who my friends were . 
they have an incredible clarity of perception , captain . i 've never encountered a species with such mental discipline ... 
i want you to take this . 
ethan ? 
that 's not the way i ... 
... gim me that fuckin ' phone ... 
maybe you resent how busy i 've been . 
the whole city has stopped . people are running around like ants ! 
what da fuck ! are you deaf ? 
sure . 
well , after a few years , we got sort of impatient . dr . <person> , i want you to meet your son . 
but ... are you engaged or something ? 
we 're going to do this . 
you know where i can get it ? i have a lot of money to spend . 
maybe . maybe . the call of the wild ! 
but the sith lords are involved ! whatever information this r-2 unit is carrying , it must be awfully important . they 're probably looking for him ... i 'm no match for the sith . this is a jedi 's work . this is your responsibility ! 
she did . bring her back . now . for a talk . 
we are awesome monster-bashers ! 
oh god veronica , my afterlife is s-o-o boring . if i have to sing `` kumbaya '' <number> more time ... 
what , like on va-kay ? 
i just said -- 
tell that to the families of the policemen who died . 
i did n't have to pee then . 
she 's off limits for bums like you . leave her alone . 
no , no . 
i do n't know . he bathed , now he is roaming the ship . he must be the only engineer in starfleet who does not go to engineering ! 
was <person> <person> your good friend ? 
look . i 'm ready to get the fuck out of here . it 's real torture for me to be here . getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans . 
alright . <person> 's ... page <number> , the fucking < u > horse < /u > dies . you know , < u > she < /u > could be in the movie , she could , she 's got a good face , she could be the doctor 's ... uh , why does it have to be his , uh , < u > wife < /u > ... ? it could be his ... 
yep . 
right . now who is the person in california ? the connection ? 
i do n't know ... getting far away , the <number> of us , for example ... and forgetting all this ... 
listen , doll - what time do you get off tonight ? 
what do you call this ? 
will you take me ? 
so how long have you known <person> ? 
since when do you believe the papers ? they killed him , kid . 
er ... <person> <person> ... the chaste . 
oh-oh- 
dad ! what 're they doing ? wuddya think they 're doin ' with <person> ? 
laurie , what 's the boogey man ? 
because ... because ... 
i 'm going down , jake ... . 
a good start . 
i 'm interested in mythology . 
if she 's so innocent , how come she murdered a child ? 
you know what i mean . i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer . and a lotta strange people . 
wait a minute , wait a minute , let 's talk a deal , <person> . we can take a lunch on this -- 
she did ? 
helluva story ! 
i do n't know . 
that hurt my feelings . 
oh , sure . <person> . i 'll get some more gravy . 
every year . 
then stick with <person> ! 
you go to school together ? 
nice . and your lighting and camera angles . you 're got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it . 
frank 's touchy about his cousins . well , it was nice to meet you , <person> <person> . 
why not ? 
<person> dae yung . north korean nuclear specialist . 
yeah , of course . 
wait a second -- you hated <person> . did n't you ? 
i 'm scared , <person> . i know it sounds crazy . but , there 's something trying to get into my body . 
how flattering . 
it does n't hurt . 
you could n't help yourself . i mean , when you 're having a drink with <number> man , you ca n't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man . you did the only decent thing . 
but more laughter than tears , i think ? yes . on balance ? i mean , remember that time when -- oh , we could talk all night , but we have to go . do n't we , juliet ? 
a thumb ? what do you mean , like cut it off ? for ten bucks ? that include the tip ? 
committed . 
i know ... but lotsa times i feel like it 's me versus the world . some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh . i mean it does n't take a genius to figure which is more important . 
yeah . 
this miserable wilderness is a state of the union . <person> 's made here the same way as in the civilized world : at the ballot box . that 's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late . get them on your side , it 's like buying manhattan for beads . with a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the new world . 
far as i 'm concerned , whatever you did in the past can stay in the past . 
michael , you and i are light years apart . you should go , but not with me . 
is this fun ? 
let me do that . 
when you were given the opportunity to enlist , a kind of contract was agreed upon . i think the army has honored its part of that agreement . 
<person> deeds -- 
this fucking job 's getting to you . you have n't written a fucking word since you started . 
pregnant . thanks for asking . 
would n't wash ? 
i 'll pay it back , besides , i do n't think i 'll ever go to class again . 
i know . i wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident . 
i do n't care ! i ai n't no freakin monument to justice ! i lost my hand , i lost my bride ! <person> has his hand , <person> has his bride ! you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget ? 
this time he did it to a kid who 's simple enough to believe him . why do n't you dump the mother , <person> ? he creates more work than he gets done . 
what about tomorrow ? 
did n't you study it in school ? 
well , she said that i was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage , and-and children . 
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you -- 
i ... i do n't know ... 
well yeah ... i know that . 
i 'm sorry , <person> <person> . i 'm sure you 're very good , but at the moment , i 've got nothing for you . if something comes up , we 'll give you a call . 
my husband didn ’ t need to slap me about , mr lombard . i volunteered ... 
<number> napkin , coming up . i wish we had some champagne to wrap it around . 
i 'm alright . will you stay home for awhile ? 
i do n't have a choice . 
i love lucy ! 
did i ever claim i was <person> <person> ? was i ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record ? no . you assumed who i was , because i was wearing this uniform . do n't believe me ? 
and ... ? 
huh ? oh , i 'm not worrying about her - i 'm worrying about that second act curtain , that 's all . 
that would work . 
fuck pets . is this your partner ? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again . <person> everything else . is this her ? 
i tried to talk to her ... it was like i knew her . <person> . 
i do n't think i could . 
where is she ? 
yes . we knew him , of course , by his real name . 
we ? do n't blame me ! 
well , okay , if you 've already made out the check . <person> is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside . 
my mom was n't a goat ? 
but <person> ? why not your own people ? 
you volunteered ? 
is everything a big fucking joke to you ? 
michael - you loved that house as a child . you could work again ! you could make it ours . we 'll sweep out the horror . and lasher with it ! 
come -- it 's a chance to try out your bedside manner , fettes . take a look at the child . 
i can breathe withour pain now , so i guess i feel great . 
what about the shit they write ? 
me neither . oh , there 's an inscription on the back . the way a crow/shook down on me/the dust of snow/from a hemlock tree/has given my heart/a change of mood/and saved some part/of a day i rued . 
this is n't a comic book store , right . it 's a bakery . 
i do n't know how you 're gon na stand it around here till after <person> . 
because the press stinks too -- history on the run , that 's all you 're interested in . you come up with anything ? 
how did you find me ?

he used to love losers . but the laws of physics changed . 
and far too aggressive . 
what 'd you do ?

i do n't know -- 
i demand to know everything . i do not trust six-hundred <number> dollars of coca to someone i do n't know .

oh no , <person> , pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched . 
yes . 
you may deny the devil , <person> , but you 'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead . 
and he left when he found out what <person> did ? what you say casts a different light on it , i guess ... i thought- 
i want to run down the street . i want to buy a toy . eat from the shops . 
you 're welcome , <person> . 
bye , <person> . thanks . 
you know , like bang her or anything ? 
a little mixup in signals . let 's go . 
yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was ... 
what about her ? 
then it 's a good guess it 's grounded . 
me ? oh , i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier . i see thousands of marching men . i see general lee with a broken heart , surrendering , and i can see the beginning of a new nation , like <person> <person> said . and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president— things like that can only happen in a country like america . 
whatta these guys want ? 
no -- i 'm looking for <person> <person> myself . i thought you might know where she is -- 
i do n't know . what 's the name of your sailboat ?

i sent it by private courier , he did n't give it to you ? that son of a gun ... ! 
or what ? 
i see that is a body ! but where did you get it ? 
what happened to you ? 
that 's what i like about these guys , j.j ... they always got protection against things we 'd never do to 'em . 
that 's your expert opinion ? 
you always want to talk about me . what about you ? 
what kind of car do you drive ? 
yes . <person> <person> <person> ' .

what 's this all about ? 
<person> to hear it . 
pretty fast , was n't it . the way they let him go . 
i know . when the storm hits , it do n't pay to be caught outside . 
if we married , we 'd shut him out forever . 
that 's preposterous -- 
his hand moved ! his goddamn hand twitched ! 
tell him i 'm out . no , tell him i 've passed away . an old war wound or something . tell him i 'm dead . and no more calls ! 
they wanted identification . i do n't have any identification . i was n't trying to hurt them . 
i think you oughta cut a ... 
what else ? 
is n't <person> <person> going on taxi soon ? maybe that 'll chill him out . 
the tape was made a year ago . i can only assume they 've reached <person> <number> by now -- 
no word at all ? 
tradition . 
see ! that 's what i like about you , man ! you 're just sharp as a razor blade . 
oh , <person> ... no , i maybe i better lie down . 
i know . i 'm going to go there tonight ... 
in a restaurant . you sit there and they swim around you . 
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster . you meet chad the nanny ? 
i was never built for these moonlight strolls . why did we have to leave the bus ? 
he 's supposed to be , but he has n't shown up yet , which is a good thing for him . 
i did n't dismiss you . i told you what i thought , but it did n't seem to matter , so you decide . besides , this is supposed to be my time with <person> . i hope you 're not going to call every <number> minutes . 
i do n't know anybody . 
tell him i want to give him his money . 
i do n't drink coffee ... 
spent it all on beer ... . 
why ? 
our honeymoon . 
very well . 
they 're all heavily armed . 
alvy . 
formaldehyde . 
from the looks of those boys , the ripper too . 
why do yo & amp ; i accuse me ? you do n't know what you 're doing -- you do n't understand -- nobody understands -- 
maybe he just went to the store . 
we do n't have an hour . we 're already supposed to be shut down . 
she blew the horn resounding . 
that 's the magic number . 
i want to ! come on ! 
depends who it 's from . 
<number> <number> thousand dollar fine and <number> months ? 
no , man , i mean it . you 're a good writer . i remember those things you 'd write during honors english . <person> shit . 
they 'd be better off , but the cause would n't be . 
and you 're a dirty cop . at least i do n't pretend to be something different than what i am . 
you 've changed you know . i do n't think there 's anything you ca n't do once you put your mind to it . 
you , <person> ? 
no , no , no . i 'm fine . it 's small , i wan na keep going -- 
macready ... ?

thank you , sir . 
hi . 
fletch , i got nervous . please ... . 
what are you after them for ? 
what kind of games ? 
captain <person> requested i complete final science briefing here before ... 
well , i hope you know what you 're in for . i 'm a very dangerous person . <person> does me bad like you . if i caught up with you that night , there 'd be <number> dead ratso long about now . hear ? 
yeah . but not with the cong . 
if you need help ... 
look , i did n't come down here to fight . 
we had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch . she felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place ... you 're upsetting yourself . would you like something ? 
then you 'll have to kill me before it 's too late . before i start killing people . 
it 's <person> . maybe you 've heard of him ? 
i remember words i said to jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her , to madden her . 
me , too . 
it 's so far in the past now . over fifteen years -- 
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at <number> . 
yes , very well , i think . are the girls in bed ? 
vicki . do you love half of me ? or all of me ? 
having a kid changes everything . i mean , there 's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings ... 
fine . 
do n't talk about <person> ? 
yeah ... too bright ... 
... who ? 
yes , <person> . 
perhaps i should rephrase the question . what i mean to say is , are you married or seriously involved with a significant other ? 
i do n't know ... 
you 're making it out like we 're friends here or something . i met him alone twice . 
there 's nothing on the walls . no pictures -- 
oh , is he dead ? 
what ? 
yes . it 's faster . 
i would call it -- unforgivable . 
no way ... would you ? 
no i do n't ... the host is enough . 
why ? 
i 'm staying , jean . 
yes . i 'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore . 
he ai n't the problem , <person> . 
i see , well this happens to be a nocturne . 
you want some company ? 
how nice . 
yeah . 
aw , the fucking thing ... i mean , the zoo is closed . 
do n't tempt me , i 'll shoot ! 
what 's wrong with just being <person> <person> ? i liked her ! 
thank you so much . good night . 
no , i do n't . i 'm sorry . i wish i knew more . 
thanks , honey , but , next time , bring <number> , save yourself a trip . 
do n't go away .

why should they ? 
you do things the hard way , do n't you ? 
do n't be sad , <person> , not with me here to give you cheer . 
yes , it is . 
well , for <number> thing , you have n't quite got the hang of it . 
we 're going to have a lot of those , we 're just going to get the money and then go all the way . 
grabs <person> by the shoulders . 
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son . 
yes . 
of course i 'd like to . 
never mind the conversation . do it , dad . 
no ! i want a debutante on a horse to step on me . leave me alone ! ! 
yeah , what ? 
jesus , i do n't know if i can get away . i 've got a client waiting . i 'd have to do some heavy duty juggling . 
oh yeah ? think about this : she ai n't as narrow-minded as you . i 'll lay odds she 's looking for character in a man . for my part , i 'd be proud to have her . i 'd goddamn worship her . 
how is your heart , <person> ... ? is the timex still ticking ... ? 
i do n't know about that . she was pretty into it . but i was n't gon na try . the whole thing is , you just got ta take it slow . <person> 'em some respect . 
no . 
like hell ! 
-- nothing ! 
but i have no sister . 
just had <number> . 
it 's terrific ! 
sure ... 
no , no . <person> <person> put braces on your daughter 's teeth and is putting her through college , bought you <number> houses and floor seats to the knick games and what thanks does she get ? you go and kill her . 
bret . what the hell is going on ? 
no , it does n't ! those keys were put there . i did n't even know ... 
that 's great . 
the fucker shot himself . ker-bang ! that 's what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental . 
believe it was that night . she buried him the next mornin ' . <person> ' in that hard caliche . 
it 's called `` solid '' ... nice to find someone you can count on , <person> . 
it 's not an exact science , wesley . he said they 'll be here ... my <person> contact has always been very reliable . 
shut up . 
i do bite my thumb , sir ! 
oooooo . 
ok , see you downstairs . 
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator . 
what ? 
it can , but it 'll have to wait in line . 
i 'm looking for <person> <person> <person> . 
it reminds me very much of this one . <person> wahr ? 
i always wanted to see new mexico . 
you 've heard the stories right ? 
never heard of 'im . we got ta lotta men here ... 
this should take care of mother .

as you wish . 
ok. bye . 
i do n't know the details of the treaty , sire , <person> <person> sent me word of its having been agreed to , and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau . 
i 'm not crazy about the `` little ... '' 
they were taking you away . 
i 've been with stinking old men who 've made me want to puke but i 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight . 
i do n't understand . 
a meat locker . 
well , i do n't know ; maybe she does deserve it . maybe she should 've come in to face you man to man . 
i mean , there 's kids that are even holding hands already but i figure there 's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on . do n't you ? 
yes . 
i 'll be right out . 
a grave ... 
one-ball mccall ? 
those <number> musicians from the garage ! 
no , of course not , <person> . you just get carried away sometimes . believe me , i understand -- 
say it again . 
you should n't have . 
yeah , that 's right . 
and what about work ? have you had any more thoughts about what you 'd like to be doing now ? 
but ... 
what do you mean ? 
of course . natural weather delivered to your door on demand . down your phoneline . for limited periods . 
right . <person> smoke , low roll . couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal . so young fireman <person> and <person> <person> , they head up stairs , get out on the fire escape -- mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across ... what were you feeling , brian ? c'mon , you promised . be honest . <person> ... <person> ! 
pimm 's dead . <person> <person> 's disappeared . they knew the puritan was coming home . 
i would hardly say you look like trash . 
he 'll never amount to a thing , trust me . at least they were cheap . 
your murder weapon ? 
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it . 
why did they do that ? 
we 've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves . 
i 'm pregnant . 
you want to have dinner ? 
i do n't have to listen to this . 
my what ? ! 
yeah , him . 
what 's the use , there ai n't none . 
that 's not the way it 's done . 
you 're not going to tell me , are you ? 
you know who it is . 
did you ask <person> to have the hat examined ? 
why , yes ! my fortune lies in my plantations . the tobacco weed . i need <number> thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work -- i fancy tobacco has a future . we will not stay there long , <number> or <number> years . . . 
take your time . <number> weeks . <number> if you need it . we 'll pay you sick leave . i do n't want to lose you . you 're a good man . here ... 
my keys ? 
were you recently promoted ? 
not my mouth . our mouth . 
too big . more like a freighter . 
i 'm saying they might shoot us on sight . you have to remember ... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them . 
was she nekkid ? 
you want to know the real kicker ? the real kicker is , for the first time in my life -- the first time -- i feel like a loser . 
that was cool , was n't it ? you know , i do n't even know where that came from . i just opened my mouth and it came out . after i said it i thought , that 's a cool line , i got ta remember that . 
i 'll be back with the coffee . 
yes . 
a very fine collection of very old pieces , do n't you think ? 
what 's that ... . ? 
looking to get out . 
when ? 
no . absolutely , and we 're going to see that it is not . 
excuse us . 
they 're wise by now . <person> is <person> , <person> <person> ? yeah , let 's try there , <person> <person> . 
actually , no . i feel a little out of place . 
yeah . 
the new ones are fine . the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble . 
right ... i thought they always did it at dawn . so long , kid . i 'm sorry . 
the art of transformation ! 
i 'm sorry i did n't get a chance to -- 
shut up . 
it 's a pair of earrings . i saw 'em in the mall <number> day , and i thought , damn , those would look good on those beautiful earlobes . so i bought 'em . and i said to myself , next time <person> says something nice , does something nice , i 'll surprise her with 'em . know how long ago that was ? six months . in <number> months , you have n't said <number> nice thing to me . that 's a long time . 
you wan na know ? turn on the t.v . watch the fucking news ! 
well , i certainly would have heard about that . 
we 'll see <person> <person> in the morning . there 's nothing to be done until then . 
i want to know where my daughter is . her name is <person> , or joanne . she 's with you . 
shut the fuck up . you play what your girlfriend plays . <person> 's going in with you . you talk to her , otherwise you do n't talk to nobody . you walk the room as many times as you want , but the second you come out , i want to know the run of the place . 
did n't go anywhere else ? no errands , no purchases ? just straight to the boat . that 's the truth . 
forget it . 
thank you . you do n't know how much i appreciate this . 
how does it ? 
night an ' day . 
stuart is fine . 
who is this ? 
you must really like him . 
muskets and uniforms and bayonets . 
not as much as you feel like hearing it . 
well , and it 's pretty cool too , ya know ? <person> ' here together an all ... 
no . it 's got ta be more than that . that hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart . too powerful . 
no . 
and the <number> of us , with almost no budget and in secret , are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars could n't solve . we ca n't keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is , chief . 
i 'm training to ... . 
and , um ... i guess ... i guess you and i , uh ... 
done it already . nothing matches . 
i was invited here by a close friend , <person> <person> , see he 's right over there . 
you do n't ? 
tomorrow . 
oh . well , what are you going to do ? you have to go to school , honey . i mean , what -- 
are you saying it was n't such a small outbreak ? 
was it a huge place ? with a view of the whole world ? 
she 's mine . anyway , she would n't suit you . 
i 'm not an agent , mrs. lampert -- i 'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds . congress seems to think that all a spy needs -- 
well , i got a call from pablo . he said this thing with <person> is a disaster . he 's giving up lab locations , names , bank accounts , he was very pissed off . <person> said to take him down . his exact words were `` <person> <person> . '' 
do n't worry about that now , child , it will all come back to you now that you 're home ... 
mind your own business . 
wherever we are , it 's better than what we left . <person> together -- 
do you remember telling me once that all through my career , i 'd never fit in ? well ... 
why ? 
you do n't wan na know , chick , you do n't wan na know . those guys been in here ? 
oh , no you do n't . <person> , now , not my best haviland . 
i do n't care . 
you know it 's true . 
<person> referenced and verified . an unidentifiable life form reading . 
i 've been moved around all my life ; dallas , <person> <person> , <person> , sherwood ohio , there 's always a 7-11 . any town , any time , i can pop a ham and cheese in the microwave and feast on a big wheel . keeps me sane . 
fire 's out , is n't it ? 
then your father 's a wimp . 
do n't ask . 
whatever , at this point all i care about is food . i 'm starving and i got a fucking killer headache . 
i 'm sorry . 
that 's all ? 
extract of pineal ! 
wait , <person> . that 's not hospitable . i want to discuss business . 
yes , you 've got to get me out of here . i 've got to find her . 
expect so . 
what are the heads ? 
no , but i did . 
i know everybody says it , but i really mean it . 
yes , yes , it 's just -- you know i 've never been the first wife . <person> was married before me . 
it 's very interesting . 
i wish there was something i could do ... . 
it 's not a homicide , lieutenant . 
you 're asking me this because of the 'lapdog ' remark . i read that . the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly . that 's your enemy , not your audience . your audience has n't even been born yet . it 's a lie that art is popular . the only thing popular about it is that it 's written about in newspapers . i 'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings . there 're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting , and <person> 's <number> of them . 
i 'm alright . and you ? 
yeah , do n't come by here any more . if i need you again i know which rock to turn over . 
it 's the <person> 's damnable work ! too cowardly to stand and fight ... he used you to save himself . 
so , tell me about your day , <person> . 
thank you . 
i do n't know . something . anything . 
so what do you think it was ? 
sure . 
i want him back . <person> , talk to me . <person> ! 
she 's an aristocrat 's daughter . she 's not <number> of us . in any case , it will all be over soon . you 'll kill <person> , and she 'll marry . 
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural . 
no , <person> ... i 'm sorry . 
do you need a secretary ? 
probably . 
yeah , a ship that 's supposed to have been lost at sea <number> years ago . you do n't think that 's just a little freaky ? 
i 'll get you close . 
i do n't understand . 
dad , we 're well out of range . 
oh , i 'm not sailing with you . i work out of the hospital here . 
no , <person> <person> 's an old friend i brought along . so , the game 's not over . put the antidote on the table , <person> . 
no . it should be dry by now . 
i do n't know . he could have told someone . he could have , like in the event of his death , somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried . 
never mind . 
helllppp ! 
yeah ... sometimes they do . 
you mean you 'll , like ' dig your way out of the grave ? euww . 
ohh ! 
you ! how dare you ? ! stop this car immediately ! 
i beg your pardon -- 
it adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy . because i 'm telling you . the krauts would n't plant <number> stoolies in <number> barrack . and whatever you do to me you 're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy . 
i 've never heard of it . 
how do i look ? 
i did n't intend to sleep all night ! i just pulled over ... have i broken any laws ? 
ma , i 'm gon na stay home and watch <person> <person> . 
you want to talk about bullshit ? <person> called you <number> times this week . she 's a fucking mess , <person> . your sister is a fucking mess . she needs you . i talk to her more than you do . 
it 's hell week . <person> . the movie murders have brought out the crazies . it 's nothing . 
he 's still barking at me . he 's blind . 
would you speak up , mrs. kramer ? i could n't hear you . 
well , i did n't care for the club much . and , i must say , i did n't care for him either . 
no ? 
you do n't want to talk about it . 
<person> mr <person> 's possessions . 
we 're losing pressure in the flotation tanks . check the manual , right over there . 
yes , thanks . 
the fontainbleau ? <number> minutes ? 
danny , what about the jews ? 
and then what ? then you 'll be safe ? 
i do n't want to get up there . 
is this another <number> of those sun tzu “ art of war ” tricks ? 
nobody 's been talking to nobody . you do n't have a case , you hear me ? it 's pure and simple . now leave me alone . <person> ? 
ravenous homosexual . 
i 've never dealt with death before . i was n't alive when my grandparents died . i wish i could know . i mean , all this ... could just be in our heads . now it feels like it 's everywhere . 
i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these . 
have you ever met <person> <person> ? 
i 'll need him . 
i ca n't help it . i mean it , i tell you . i 've had more than my share . nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing ! 
if you 'd lost confidence in me , why did you give me the kronos suit ? 
if <person> catches you in here after lights out , she 'll chew my ass ragged . 
not mine , stupid . yours . 
where ? 
spare me , burke . i 've had my psych evaluation this month . 
i beg your pardon ? 
we do n't publish a record in the paper , i can tell you that . 
i believe we share an art instructor 
alive ? 
yeah ? 
kay . 
darling , you ca n't go through any more of this . now you get together your clothes and your skates and we 'll go out to my family 's in the country . 
you can call me ostreicher . 
you nuts ? let him order ? you on his side ? you 're not such a good waitress . you get out , too . 
some day you will . 
prove it . 
you 're more than modest . 
nothing else . 
my ex-husband . my work drove him away . made his life a misery . he thinks i ’ m obsessed , punishing myself for what happened to our son . but he ’ s a good guy . he ’ ll listen to you . he won ’ t turn you in if i ask him not to . i can pretty much guarantee that . <person> ? 
of course i have n't got a nose . 
i 'm not going to hurt you . 
um , excuse me , sir , but the situation 's more complicated than that . the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has . 
max ? you men we 're having company again ? 
there 's no more left ? 
that 's what he said . 
oh no . 
eddie , you 're a born loser . 
okay , okay , fran . i deserve that . but just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls ? because he 's unhappy at home -- because he 's lonely , that 's why -- all that was before you , fran -- i 've stopped running . 
you 're dismissed . 
i 've since changed my mind . i designed this place , based on my belief that i was doing what the legal system could n't or would n't do . <person> had the company buy the property and they pay the bills . it 's a tax write off . on the books everything looks kosher . i have an office on <number> that i have n't seen in <number> years . 
that checks out with our finding , thank you , <person> <person> . 
all right- let 's go into battle . i 'm <person> . 
nice to meet you . 
this is a travesty ! captain rhodes is ... 
no . me no hoto . <person> ? 
i need <number> last favor . go back and get the twins . 
great ! he 's poor , this wrestler ! he 's had to struggle ! 
tomorrow . 
are you a doctor ?

i 'm a paleontologist . 
first offence : verbal warning . second offence : written warning . that <number> 's filed and sometimes copied to the gaming board . my discretion . third offence : you 're sacked on the spot . you 'd never work in a casino in this country again . there 's another rule : you 're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino . if you see someone who 's gambled here , even if it 's just casually on the street , you must ignore him . or her . you 're not married , are you ?

those creatures.. ! 
i know , i should probably tell you , but i just do n't feel like it . to be honest , i 'm really angry at you . i admired you so much more when you were purely wicked . i mean , look at you now , running around trying to `` get to the bottom '' of things . trying to `` save the city . '' it 's true we 're about to do a very nasty deed , but really , what 's it to you ? since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic oasiburgians ? you 're just not yourself , anymore . 
the videos .

we 're looking at <number> years , maybe ten . is that what you want ... <person> <person> ? 
it 's not her fault , it 's not her fault , the guy must have called them . look , look , look , she 's telling us . 
yes sir . it turns out we put an innocent man into the `` park '' and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine . that is also about the time when <person> began refusing . 
i 'll be all right . i 've got <person> to protect me . 
tell me , <person> - how are things with you ? happy ? 
what ? 
you analyze everything out of existence . you analyze me out of existence . i wo n't let you . love is not so simple . <person> , <person> , why do doves bill and coo ? why do snails , coldest of all creatures , circle interminably around each other ? why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates ? why do flowers open their petals ? oh , <person> , <person> , surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion ... a general warmth in the palms of your hands ... a strange heaviness in your limbs ... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a <number> times more tantalizing , more exalting , than thirst ? 
who are you ? what are you doing out here ? 
do they have to look so ... robotic ? 
witnesses say some wacko went judge hunting with a late model . i got an artist working on a computer composite now .

<person> wayne . -- i 've read your work . i quite like it . 
pretty good . <person> was surprised to hear from you . you talk to <person> ? 
please do n't go . 
i 've seen enough phoney id 's in my time to recognize that the ones they 've got cost a fortune . add all that up and i do n't know what the fuck it means , but these are bad ass preps and they 're here to stay . 
if it wo n't work , it 's beyond my power to fix it . but if it does , there 's no telling how long it will hold up . it 's a jury rig , at best , and we 'll need every second of use we can get out of it . that 's why i do n't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests . 
i 'd be happy to mention it to him . 
who 's fucking around ? i 'm not making fun . let 's do it , baby . 
did it ever bother you ? 
so we 're spending forty-seven <number> dollars to make people feel better about a car they 've already bought ?

maybe i should n't put it that way . i 'm on my best behavior . i 've got to watch what i say . 
you 'd lose your security deposit ? 
how long will i be in here ? 
they 'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye ... people watching would spit at them . 
yes . should i take her , <person> ? among her dolls ? make a doll of her in turn ? 
then i 'll live for both of us , <person> . i 'll be the most free , truest animal in the whole forest . for both of us . 
you should n't . you washed me up very thoroughly . 
yeah . but get outta here . he 's comin ' back .

it 's in michigan . <person> , what do i have in common with those people ? or with anyone ? 
i do n't want our lives ruined because of this . i love you , frank . i want this to work -- but you have to help me . you have to come back from where ever it is you are .

i do n't how much i went -- but i was enrolled . i was such a loser back then . i was -- misguided , pathetic -- i was very fat . not even close to what i am today . not the frank tj mackey you 're eager to talk to because i was swimming in what < u > was < /u > as opposed to i < u > wanted < /u > .

we get to peek into <person> 's brain . 
well , you know how those millionaires are . these came for you . 
<person> humbled you when first you met him , <person> ... but that experience was part of your training . it taught you , among other things , the value of patience . had you not been so impatient to defeat <person> then , you could have finished your training here with <person> . you would have been prepared . 
i 'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show . 
somebody 's been smoking in here for months . 
yes -- those of <person> <person> and a thumb print of miss lawson 's .

you and i are gon na straighten this out with the sheriffs , and then we 'll wait for the man to call . when he gives the word , we move . 
no meurice , it 's worse than that . something really happened , i think <person> 's dead -- 
but at the playhouse . <person> ? 
you share it with over <number> <number> people every day . you know that 's the population of new zealand ? what 's manhattan , thirteen miles long ? that 's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles . read about this <number> guy . gets on the subway and dies . six hours he 's riding around before anybody notices . think about that . here 's this corpse doing laps around manhattan courtesy of the new york transit system , people getting on and off , sitting next to him , and still nobody catches on . <number> <number> . that 's too damn many people .

well , i-i hope that -- that -- 
do n't worry , <person> . just go , you 'll miss your flight . 
just a lucky guess . 
they 're not doing this , <person> . i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi . when they recruited me they told me women made up <number> percent of the bureau . i felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . but it has n't turned out that way . and now , if i were to be transferred to omaha , or <person> or some field office where i 'm sure i could rise , it just does n't hold the interest for me it once did . not after what i 've seen and done . 
nope . 
what ? 
well , she was very specific . she wanted her ashes to be thrown over <person> <person> . 
i 'm sorry . who 's your friend ?

some . 
come on , <person> . a job 's supposed to pay your bills , not put you in danger . 
you know each other ?

you 're not sorry . you 're scared . you 're a psychologist , norman . you pride yourself on knowing when someone 's lying to you , not telling you the truth . and now you 're scared ... because you 're not sure you can tell anymore . 
<person> knows . <number> street . we 'll meet you there . 
what ? ? 
nobody .

but <person> -- 
aye-aye sir . engines to half . 
as far as <person> <person> is concerned the worst has happened , the panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in vietnam . by doing so , they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction . 
no he wo n't . 
are you mad ? <person> loves it here . she told me yesterday . 
thanks . 
hey , that 's <person> 's throne ! how did adrian get that ? is dad okay ? 
several times . i 'm not as dumb as i act , you know . when <person> <person> makes love to <person> <person> ... most romantic scene in all of literature . 
just settling an old score . you might say revenge . 
i met this girl ... 
i 'm trying to find things out myself -- that 's the whole point . 
i met <person> <person> when he tried to pick my pocket . 
... what is this ? 
<person> to hear it . 
all pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer , an esper <number> -- i believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced . 
i never got to know him , really . i could n't speak japanese , and his <person> was terrible . but i could n't say anything , because his english was better than my japanese . 
if you occupied the room next to <person> <person> , you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby . 
well , i do . 
i bet you want your head scratched . 
yeah , reconsider fucking his shit up . 
how much longer is this gon na last ? 
hmm ... let 's see ... no , there 's something missing . 
we want to frighten you away . so that you 'll move out . 
i 'll send you straight to hell , <person> ! 
somebody 's come . <person> . 
that object out there is less than <number> days from earth , <person> <person> . we 've got to intercept while it still is out there ! 
moved out . 
precisely , maria . tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation ... the privilege of restoring life , by <number> tender act of mercy , to a doomed fellow creature . 
no dog . 
tsk , believe me , this will be the last time . 
not you too 
<person> group ? 
no -- never . 
i do n't mean to pry , but i see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back , and i begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions are n't stowed in there . are you in some kind of trouble or what ? 
it 's a scene . memorize it . 
all he needed was a reasonable explanation . 
i love secrets . 
yeah . 
'night . 
i hope you are comfortable here , inside my kingdom ... 
yeah , well that 's a sore subject , and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage . 
what about <person> , <person> <person> ? 
yah , no , i 'm sure you are . <person> vouched for you and all . i got every confidence in you fellas . 
we ca n't get to her . i 've tried . 
frankly , no . 
oh my god , sir ! 
hah ! 
oh , babe ... 
no , where is it ? 
caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike . used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes . so now i got ta get my wheels fixed . 
`` abuse '' the copy machine . there 's an image . 
i had this weird flash just then . 
well -- 
so what do i get in return ? 
okay , dad . 
it can turn itself on , <person> ! it does n't need a quarter . 
pavonine . it 's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric . 
do n't cry . 
you could n't say . 
good ... yuppie piece of shit . 
sign the form so we can get to it . 
but i 've never picked a fight in my entire life ! 
six . i go red next year . 
jack is dead ! 
-- in magazines nobody reads . 
i know what you mean , i know what you mean , i get this feeling -- 
... a little . i was a little tipsy . do n't call me pathetic . 
the footprints . 
yeah ! he 'd kill for you dave . he likes you . your mind . 
go out , go out by the sung vase and , and catch this . 
if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back . that would have left us with nothing . 
oh ... can i help you ? 
rache , it may take time . 
you do n't know it was an accident . you only saw a dead man and <number> men carry him . 
yeah . too sweet . 
nachurly . <person> ' like i 'd tell you . 
who are you calling ? ! 
it 's just a game ... ! alright . <person> <person> , or ... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth ? 
good . good . we go <person> . 
i 'll need the sergeant 's okay on that . 
how nice . 
and that 's more important than finding <person> ? 
now get this mug . you 've got the kind of chin i just love to touch . and if you do n't get out of here , i 'm going to hang <number> right on it . 
who cares ? 
yes -- yes -- yes . 
and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder . 
here ? 
no , we 're not . 
yeah , downtown . 
you 're looking fine , major . 
what sins have you to confess ? 
the past , the future , whatever this object holds . 
the very fact that they 're authorities should give you reason . people will do anything to protect their own interests . for all you know he was killed at the < u > hands < /u > of the police . 
because he 's my friend , too . 
`` o , no , it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken ; it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken . '' 
there 's someone in the house . 
in any case , gentlemen , a charming , beautiful , exquisite woman . i warn you , if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court , and when the duchess takes the stand ... 
... except <number> . 
yes , i thought that it would be best . 
rather safe than sorry . that 's my motto ! 
i thought i could , too . *my* business -- this fine future ! i have no future i *care* about , if this boy is broken ! i -- i ca n't sleep . the only important thing in my life now is to save what i can for him . i want him to get a start again -- i 'll see that he 's taken care of as long as he lives -- ! saunders -- whether you ever mean anything to him or not -- 
george is going to open a shop . 
maybe i 'll tell you when i know you a little better . what are you doing tonight ? 
aw , she was with some nosey , smartass high-rise kids . they were poking around ... asking stupid questions . 
now you 're being silly . we do n't need <number> cars . we have a car . and not <number> of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit . an isotta-fraschini . have you ever heard of isotta-fraschinis ? all hand-made . cost me twenty-eight <number> dollars . 
you got ta let me stay here tonight , <person> . 
it is no trouble at all , my child . this is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create . my footing is not too secure . 
yeah , i understand . <person> does n't want to come along in the first place , but he gets a third of the find . that 's a sweet deal . 
she 's adorable . but i had to end it . 
then quit . you should be going to school anyway ... 
well , if you 'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ... 
you probably do n't remember the night we played . your first year as husband and wife . 
and you ate <number> baclavas , right ? i not to touch them , mine was awful . 
i do n't know for <person> 's sake ! 
and yours . 
you know what would be great ? 
she said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart . 
well ... thank you again . 
all to pieces ! 
then maybe i should offer it to your daughter ... 
double-exposures ? but they 're not -- i was in -- 
you miss him ? < u > why < /u > ? 
of course . 
oh , i do too , sir . 
feel free . 
whataya mean , no record ? 
<person> <person> <person> , sir . do n't you remember ? i was captain of the team . 
yes -- only there 's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it 's forcing the body 's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they 're accustomed to . the senator 's body is literally burning itself out . <person> -- this machine kills people and i do n't think <person> realizes it . 
nothing . 
yah , no problem , i 'll just fax that over to ya , then . 
we 're full on bonded . 
great . 
`` there once was a man named <person> , <person> kept <person> away from the mob . came the turn of the tide and semple - he died - and now poor <person> 's out of a job ! '' 
then i ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes . 
no . 
oh , yeah . <person> . i 'm fine . i just ... had to get home early . 
look at him , grandstanding ... 
we 'll get to the spider later , <person> <person> . right now , we want to know everything that you saw . 
no . no ... 
i have no idea . 
all flayed ... ? 
i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us , that 's all . 
yes . i 've never been very far from it , for a long time . will you do something for me ? 
let 's go from both ends . we 'll cut him off . 
okay . 
h-h-harding , the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you , y-you 're the pr-pr pr ... 
she leaves , somebody 'll be on her . 
<person> . i do n't care a whit about your private life . 
options . 
where ? 
my mother used to hum this to me . like her mother hummed it to her . and my great grandmother <person> hummed it to her . 
<person> , boss— 
yep . sometimes they do , but usually they end up crazy or dead . 
everybody down ! on the double ! ! 
some plain soda . <person> must be expecting a record run in new haven ... 
uh , i have a plane to catch to cleveland ... can i get my winnings ? 
are you still fucking < b > here < /b > ? ? 
i was n't satisfied ! i suppose i proposed to you ! 
get the fuck away from me . 
i know . i followed you . to the zoo , to her house , to your house ... 
are you <person> 's pimp ? 
right , right . 
oh ? 
this week anyhow . 
what about them ? 
<person> ? 
the war will still be here tomorrow . 
are you going down there ? 
about now . would you like a drink ? 
yes , i 'm going to set you free . is the sedative ready ? 
not like this ... they do n't seem so bright with all the city lights . i never really noticed them much ... 
he run away often ? 
you were just curious ? 
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected , functioning hand in hand with law enforcement . the r.c.m.p . brought me in to review their investigations ... ... fact-check their records , see if there 's anything they missed , anything they should be doing different . i 'm here for a few days , before i head back up to virginia . these reports go to the justice department eventually . i spoke to your f.b.i . contact a few days ago , uh ... 
funny ... 
you were in africa ? 
i see . 
i will never get tired of hurting you , <person> , so you might want to change your attitude . 
because -- it 's beyond intellect . it 's emotion . it 's passion . it has to be experienced -- it ca n't be imagined . 
again ? how long before we start noticing the difference ? 
but what ? 
look , duff - most of the men i know - they 're kind of sad . when i met you the other day i had a feeling that you 're different . that 's why i went out with you . i thought we might have something to say to each other . 
you all right -- ? 
i 'm only asking what you think . 
you even doubt it ? i do n't think we got set up , i know we got set up ! i mean really , seriously , where did all those cops come from , huh ? <number> minute they 're not there , the next minute they 're there . i did n't hear any sirens . the alarm went off , okay . <person> , when an alarm goes off , you got an average of <number> minutes response time . unless a patrol car is cruising that street , at that particular moment , you got <number> minutes before they can realistically respond . in <number> minute there were seventeen blue boys out there . all loaded for bear , all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing , and they were all just there ! remember that second wave that showed up in the cars ? those were the ones responding to the alarm . but those other motherfuckers were already there , they were waiting for us . you have n't thought about this ? 
that is correct . i was engaged to render an opinion . 
is it true ? 
what ? 
i had this crank call ? from some guy who thinks he saw her ? i said , what would a bride be doin ' , on her wedding ... 
yeah , we just watched a few movies . took a few notes . it was fun . 
soon , <person> <person> . 
<person> will be back here in a minute . 
it 's getting hot in here . 
no , no . look , i probably should have told you a little more , about the part i intended to play . we 'll go through it all again tonight . 
so you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya ? 
yeah , they hate me . 
that 's very serious . who 's her doctor ? 
was i at that dinner ? 
exactly . 
you named the kid after yourself , huh ? 
thirty meters up , lance ; i saw the fucking flash . 
i had lunch with <person> not <number> hours ago . as always with women who want to find out things , she told more than she learned ... ... do you want to change your story about <person> beating at your door the other night ? 
what the fuck ? i just asked you for a job yesterday ! 
the page 's missing . then their sos was real . 
its too late . 
no no no no . 
you want me to handle him ? i think i ’ m ready ... 
listen , man . i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had . 
then ... 
i did n't get the bet down in time . 
see <person> ! do you copy ? 
from what ? 
i 'm sure i can come up with something . 
i owe you shit . 
the most important thing . is being together . 
look , i have n't really focused on that kind of thing . 
very funny..maybe he has heard and does n't want to know . maybe he 's lost interest . 
you think they do n't know what you know ? believe me , they know . she works for the president . they know everything . 
you put my friend in the ground , with your mickeymouse < u > taskforce < /u > ... izsat the kind of headlines that preserve and promote , you , sir ? 
about what ? 
lower . 
who ? 
sure . 
first i have to find some tools . i need a half and a nine-six-tenth . 
maybe . 
oh , <person> <person> -- it 's you ! 
sharks are man-biters , <person> <person> . not man-eaters -- 
forgiven . you know , when we were on that plane , i was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it . that silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys , covering ten times the distance of the plane . it was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed . and i 've been thinking that somehow you 're that plane , and i 'm that silly shadow . that all my life i 've been rushing up and down hills , leaping rivers , crashing over obstacles , never dreaming that <number> day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms . 
high voltage ? 
where we headed ? 
listen to me saying what ? 
yeah ... that was a good scene . i mean , for a horror movie . 
the girls will grow up . they only know you from television anyway . 
your calendar , your cell phone , your whoo pig sooey hat , some pictures of that ketch you wanted . 
you should hear the bird . 
this is my old friend carol.. i told you about her . 
are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers ? 
<person> baxter -- nineteenth floor . 
any happier than any other asshole in life . 
i ca n't man , i 'm punished ! 
the pearls wo n't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck -- -- i hate them ! 
of course you do . i 'll stay here and pray . 
you see , madam , i am part of an international student 's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines . 
you fly around the world with lazy young men who do n't have any love for you , and use you like a whore . 
what did you see ? 
i 'm sorry . 
but if you stay in this house , i can promise you this -- 
hear what ? 
she 's just insecure . once you get to know her she 's fabulous . 
oh <person> , i 'm a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent . 
i want to be the way i was before . 
i know . you 're quite a celebrity these days . are you here because you have info ... about my case ? 
you teach them ! 
because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was yolander ... 
if she asks me any question i want to tell her . i want to tell her everything i 've done . 
who ? 
what ? 
ah . the mating call of the blonde . the night is young , the moon is bright , whataya feel like doing tonight ? 
a small price . 
uh-huh . 
they 'll ... they 'll < u > blackball < /u > me ... 
i left early because i was n't feeling very well . 
no , no , on the football field . they called me ... ... the smallville flash . 
we have to be certain . once they 're up , we can hardly turn the boat around . 
if that child comes here ... if i find her trying to steal your love from me ... i 'll kill her . yes , i 'll kill her : 
i do n't know . maybe i will say it . how old are you anyway ? 
well ... i guess i ca n't . 
hey , i invented fake i.d.s , alright . that 's not the problem ... they 're playing disco music in there , man . 
no ! you listen to me , if you 're not where i want you in fifteen minutes i 'll hollow her out . do you understand ? 
who knows . who cares ... you wanted slime . you got slime . 
tuttle ! ... mumble ! you 've had that scab tuttle here , have n't you ? 
i do n't know . 
yes , that <person> , <person> <person> . and since you agree with me we 've never met , you must also agree that i have n't hired you to do anything . certainly not spy on my husband . i see you like publicity , <person> <person> . well , you 're going to get it . 
well , all the same . if we get to missoula , help me find a car . i 'd appreciate it . then ... you can ... 
dulcea ! that miserable , manipulating loathsome she-devil of a witch ! ! 
then what you telling me to study in them for ? 
what happened in those <number> minutes ... ? 
with pleasure , captain . 
i remember when i just saw you . skinny winnifred . <person> , you were skinny . 
sure . i wo n't hold my breath . 
no . i 'm up . 
lem me ask you something . i put a bird feeder out in the yard , but the squirrels , they keep taking -- 
matter of fact , <person> , i 'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown , `` the girls of xenia . '' just to show my appreciation . 
it 's a long shot , but ... billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it . 
<person> 's gone . 
what 's wrong , <person> ? 
i 'm serious . 
this boy from west side , plays tackle both ways . bench-presses <number> pounds . you imagine having that much weight on top of you ? pushing down ? be hard to breathe . <person> to swallow . 
it 's the kids , you know , not <person> . he had nothing to do with this -- except pay , of course . he 's always willing to pay . he 's extremely generous . i 'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me . 
he 's not the type to worry . 
and with prison record . 
what the hell 's going on ? 
and have < u > you < /u > found peace.. ? 
total delirium . 
is that a good sign , <person> ? 
i have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man ... but i 'm talking too much again , no ? 
i 'm so glad we agree . 
gim me a break . i 'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures . is that going to hurt him ? 
that wo n't be necessary . <person> or later i knew you 'd crack this thing , <person> . you got me . 
so you do n't love him . you would n't say you -- 
everything was different . 
forty-six yoyodyne employees . <person> 's <person> , new jersey , <number> . 
nuh-uh , <number> ! punk volume <number> . you were n't there , so you ca n't understand the magic . 
they 're everywhere . 
scrambled eggs , kippered herring , fried potatoes -- and a whole onion . i want to eat the onion like an apple . do you understand ? 
i know . i 'm sorry . let me refund your cigarette money , and we 'll call it even . 
to put the rout all that was not life . and not , when i came to die , discover that i had not lived . <person> <person> . 
some cash . jewelry . the other stuff i can replace , but there 's a cardboard box ... photos of my mother . they 're the only ones i have of her . 
no ! not the knights who say `` ni '' ! 
it 's not funny at all . <number> ca n't get intimate just off hand . i could go to england with you and everything like that -- supposing i met you next year and i said : 'how do you do , <person> <person> ! and you said : 'that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester ' . 
reed , we 're running out of time . 
how 'bout some cokes ? 
his peritoneum has ruptured ... 
let us decide that . 
that is sad . 
let me heal you , baby . 
no . 
you reek of mrs. <person> 's <person> <person> ... 
so you admit you just lied ? 
we ca n't make the microwave work . 
yeah . at night . 
yeah , i thought he was supposed to be helpful . 
see how easy it is ? perhaps <person> <person> left her door unlocked . or if she did n't , there 's a passkey on every floor in the linen room . the head porter has a passkey . the bell captain has a passkey . the hotel 's full of passkeys . 
oh do you ? have you any idea , <person> <person> , how many times i 've had to listen to <person> <person> on the comm , telling me his troubles ? have you any idea the ribbing i 've had to endure in the officers ' mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap ? 
you ca n't just - 
and my class . it 'll be hard to find a good substitute . and what about my math program ? 
that 's not an answer , is it ? 
i 'm going to bed now . 
yes ? 
where ? at the city hall ? no ! i want the whole wedding or we will have <person> <person> . for a whole wedding to be planned , a date must be set . 
then he 'll be back at blue balls ? 
i 've got something for you . 
i could do it if i tried . even <person> thinks so . 
will you take some advice ? if you 're looking for romance -- count me out -- -- if you know what 's good for you . 
on top of him ? 
i 'm from south dakota . where are you from ? 
he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me . his offices take up an entire floor of that big , new building on <number> street , and he was using all these words i never heard before . he even offered me a job . 
shhh . 
always ... but sometimes i do n't understand . i know i 'll never have your kind of brains , in big deals . but <person> , this is a street thing . and <person> <person> in miami is behind the rosato brothers . 
maybe . 
no , no . 
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority ? are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for <person> 's lightning rod ? 
but then you knew what he was like all along ... maybe his killing <person> was a thing you had counted on ... 
gozer . 
you like to play games , do n't you , <person> ? 
she 's dead . 
since that time i 've devoted more thought to the subject , and that 's how i feel now . 
just business . 
the device has stopped responding . 
< u > what < /u > ? 
let 's go . do us both a favor . 
more like other people putting their business in my nose . 
c'mon ! let 's just go . 
what ? you gon na tell me you 're lost ? 
what was that ? 
i 'm fine . 
nice family , are they ? church-goers and all that ? 
i 'll tell you what it is , <person> <person> . i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways . i ai n't used to 'em , sir . 
i got to agree with that . 
come on , man . there 's love and there 's ... 
i do n't know . 
uh-huh . 
give you something to shoot at , senator -- if you figure on doing any talking . 
chaz -- what happened to <person> ? 
no -- i wanted to be a professional hockey player . 
what can i do for you , <person> ? 
i was an officer . 
i could n't sleep ... i should get going ; i feel really weird ... 
do you mind putting that gun away ? my wife does n't care , but i 'm in a delicate condition . 
more or less . 
thank you so much . i love slugs . all slugs , not just banana slugs . 
great minds think alike . 
all it says is that it 's above the vulva ... but where the hell is the vulva ? 
fernet and tonic . 
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask . if you 're jealous ... 
shut up ! 
uh ... butt-snatch ... 
a new disease . 
<person> brought a ouija board and we summoned her . 
you ... you mean <number> ? 
maybe the problem is your < u > kids < /u > . maybe they 're spoiled , coddled < u > brats < /u > ! 
they killed her . and they 're trying to buy it ... 
why do n't you stay a little while , just for talking . 
what ? 
goodnight , lydia . 
i did n't kill anyone , <person> , there was no one to kill ! 
yeah , uh ... so how are you ? what 's going on ? 
the baby they made up . 
yeah . <person> . i 'm going to be going away for awhile . 
if a man can not earn , he must borrow . 
well . this is ... surprising . does <person> ... ? 
define that . 
good , because we got a fine old american custom we want to teach you . you know what these are ? 
well , i feel i owe you something for all this ... 
right . and how did she dress him ? 
well , it worries me . i want you to get swept away . i want you to levitate . i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish . 
i do n't know if there 's anything wrong with me because i do n't know how other people are ... ..sometimes i cry a lot ... ..for no reason . 
buzzzzzzzzzz . <person> , wrong answer ! 
you know i ca n't . 
you want cash ? 
mutants ? ! 
i dunno , i dare n't go in there - just about get her wired up , and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff ? we should be out chasing major violators .. 
not this minute . 
hmm . a difficult proposition ... difficult proposition at best . perhaps you 've noticed ... we 're not exactly packing them in these days ... 
what ? 
i do n't know what you mean . 
what is this bridge ? 
why ? was it supposed to be funny ? 
the average man would go after the reward . all you seem to— 
we have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job . 
he took my driver 's license , <person> , he knows where we live . 
my pleasure . 
no , you do n't . if i ever get word of you steppin ' over the line again , i 'm gon na ventilate that suit of yours . 
you should n't tell me that now . after all these years ! i put all your things in here . go in , go in ... 
you know you ca n't win this <number> . 
that makes me feel just terrible . 
get a typist . gettim a typist . get outta here . 
if you really want a get up an ' leave me , you can read about it in the newsprint . 
great to get away , take it easy . next week , i 'll get back to work . 
i do n't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid . it was out there ... 
why ? 
no harm done , ma'am . 
int . brynner 's van - day . 
we 're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can . 
no - the police say i 've killed fourteen - but i 've not - i 've killed many more . it amazes me how they just have n't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just do n't get missed . i agree , some of them are well hidden - i probably could n't even show you where i put them - <number> girl , number <number> i think the press called it - she was n't even mine - i do n't know who did it but i did n't 
i agree , sir . what we need are larger prisons . more money . 
how ya feeling ? 
almost right . 
yeah , a psychiatric hospital . <person> , i 'm serious -- 
yes . <person> had <number> of his daughters from behind . he was cutting her . i shot him . 
wait ! this is only <number> ! i 'm supposed to be leaving messages in <number> . it 's not the right number yet . that 's the problem . <person> ! how can i contact them ?

sexual surrogate ... slash ... companion . 
trust , responsibility , taking the weight , for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them . and above all , not hurting the object of your love . 
dope ? 
the fbi thinks it 's possible -- the democrats need a campaign issue , corruption 's always a good one . get off the story , <person> -- or put some people on mcgovern 's finances ; fair is fair , even in our business . 
i 'll wait for him .

but -- who are you -- what d'you do here ? 
you said you 'd be here ! you promised me -- you promised <person> ! what could be more important than that ? 
we was outa food . tonight we had meat . not much , but we had it . <person> <person> 's gon na give up his meat on account a other fellas ? an ' <person> needs milk . think <person> 's gon na starve that baby jus ' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin ' outside a gate ? 
i 'll go on a hunger strike . i know your caper . the kidney punch and the rabbit-clout . the third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap .

that is not so -- you do n't want to be alone . 
only if you grab my ass . 
wo n't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them ? 
right now . 
my brother had shouldered that burden , allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs . 
i might be , but you 're not welcome here . 
involved ! <person> ! she attached my goddamn paycheck ! child support . why do you think i ca n't afford a lawyer ? you know what i mean . why i got a court appointed lawyer instead of a , uh , more experienced ...

recovering nicely . 
that 's right . 
ninotchka , i would n't bring this up if we were n't such good friends . 
i 'd better press your evening clothes , sir . you have not for- gotten <person> 's new year 's party .

ready to go , go , go ? 
but you 're the gods ! 
sometimes you ca n't know what i 'm doing . it 's better that way . 
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with <number> of those little dogs . 
here . 
how come you keep askin ' ? 
you guess ? my parole was broke <number> hundred miles back when we burnt <person> <person> .

what are you so worked up about ? 
ulf report ? nobody 's mentioned that in years . you mean someone actually read it ? 
where did your brother escape from ?

now that 's a crap company , sure you 'll make money on the takeover rumor , but what 's being created . nothing . no substance behind it . 
like do anything , you know . 
university and <number> -- want to carry my books ? 
you were in an accident ? 
i think i would remember . what makes you think it 's me ?

so you sold ninety <number> units . so what ? does that mean you 're a genius ? you 're a great artist ? you 're higher up the ladder ? you got an extra gold star on your fuckin ' forehead ? 
say what ? 
yes i ca n't ... .i do n't make enough money to be able to do that . 
no . 
do n't be too smart , <person> -- you 're out in the rough yourself . you had an argument with <person> a couple of hours before he was killed -- but i 'll deal with that later -- 
it 'll be our first foreign war in fifty years , <person> . we 'll cover it the way the `` <person> <person> '' covers the church social ! the names of everybody there ; what they wore ; what they ate ; who won the prizes ; who gave the prizes - i tell you , <person> , i envy you . by bradford leland , the `` <person> 's '' special correspondent at the front . i 'm almost tempted - 
i 'm trying to get you some action , but you 've got to help me out just a little bit . 
i am committed . i love you . 
are you sure ? 
they could be . 
i 've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen , i just know they do . so the job 's to figure out how to deal with the consequences . which you did ... you took that sonuvabitch out . 
yes , it is ! you 're talented , famous , wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you , even in the wind and rain ... 
well , sir , i 'm an excellent filer . 
a man of the cloth ? 
he was in desperate straits . he 'd been trying to raise money all day . he laughed -- poor devil ! and then a man like preysing kills him . 
i do n't know . i thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is . 
what are you driving at , boss ? 
thank you ... 
life is a burden for me . nothing gives me any pleasure ; i find only sadness in everything around me . it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live , and probably always shall live , are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight . 
ya know , i ai n't never been in an institution of psychology before . 
i could take you downtown . 
can i tell you something ? 
how do you know that ? 
... <person> . i want to talk to <person> . put her on the phone . 
the ambulance guys lugged him up .

you said he was dead . 
really ? 
when was that ? 
do i know you ? 
i can see the hammer still , it was cocked ... 
i do n't wan na kill anybody . but if i got ta get out that door , and you 're standing in my way , <number> way of the other , you 're gettin ' outta my way . 
you 're not a monster , <person> . just a confused man . 
the queen forbids it . i can not allow it because i can not live without you . without you , i can not find the strength to be who i must be . please . 
like i know his intention ? or yours for that matter ? i should join <person> . i 'm too old for this bullshit . 
no -- 
who are you ? 
sure . just a minute . 
why are you here ? 
you 're a sweet man , <person> . 
i do n't know her . he has n't called , he 's hardly written , just these cryptic notes . you do n't just dump people . 
fbi needs a taste of the street . and i 'm it . 
impossible ! he was dead before he entered cryo-statis . there is no possible way he could be alive . 
<person> did n't show up . what could i say ? besides , it 's double time . 
<person> <person> . how do i know you 're you ? 
he said what ? 
<person> at the general store asked me to bring these . did n't expect we 'd already met . 
what is that ? 
you 're not going to fail me are you ? 
as a matter of fact i did . they 've got some work to do tonight , but they 're gon na come tomorrow . 
stop it . what 're you , crazy ? 
no . no , i 'm serious . i 'm not joking . i just like you . that 's all . 
or building blocks for a world that never formed . 
what ? 
well , you 've got the rest of your lives . 
i 'll go . 
you ca n't , but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at el ray is a good start . 
yes ... you know there 's a lot of differences between men women . 
look , fuck the border . let 's just dig in and wait for things to cool down . 
goddamn you , <person> , do n't make me do this ! 
i heard you might be moving back ... 
i 'd forgotten how exciting it is working together . 
< u > it was a pact < /u > . you break it and there are no excuses . you guys have to -- 
great ? he 's <number> -- you told her to stay away from him . 
i suppose so . 
-- you split the team , man . and what was that crap with the standpipe ? you 'd think you and a hose were never introduced before . 
well that 's right ! if then ! believe me , <person> , <person> is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man ! 
no , you do n't want to go down there . i am going down there . and i 'm going to find < u > < b > reverse < /b > < /u > on this thing and floor it . 
he video taped you . 
mmm-more like -- i have a little trouble . trusting people . 
evil . 
hello , baby . 
hi , <person> . <person> 's the weather up there ? 
you know it . 
yes . maybe you 're right , <person> . maybe we 're being too conservative . <person> <number> percent . 
sure . 
i ca n't . 
what was it , somebody 's daughter ? 
it 's not about him seeing you in it . it 's how you feel . you 'll feel sexy in lingerie and it 'll show . it 's an inner thing . 
yeah . do you know what the word & quot ; asshole & quot ; means . 
yeah . i do n't ever know what to say . 
<person> . 
why did you go in the sphere , <person> ? 
what were you doing in my room ? 
now hold on . there 's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job . 
you see , major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the president in the war room . he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes . 
she 's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg . oh , <person> ... please do n't let it be a dick . 
are you challenging me ? 
bacon cheeseburgers . 
oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? '' 
i saw you just now -- then i saw you cry -- and now i see you in the mirror -- grusinskaya ... 
no , that 's fine . it 's not often <number> has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star . it was a thrill for me . how is he ? 
oh , sure . 
why should n't you ? please sit down . 
well , are you sure about this baby thing ? it 's not the ticking clock shit , is it ? 
cole , i 'm marrying <person> . 
out there is a perfect engine , an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that 's all . look at that ! those proportions are correct . i know sharks . 
she 'll be all right ? 
the only other spook i knew was a liar . charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth . he 'd lie about his favorite color . but then i reckon it 's an occupational hazard . all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies . 
and who would you think of , for such a task ? 
you should have more self-control . you were in the army . 
sorry ... 
come on , <person> , it 's your section and your man . 
yeah , i heard that <number> before . 
you 're a cold-hearted bastard , are n't you ? how 'd you ever get so mean , <person> ?

she wrote it . there are chapters in this book that describe the stuff i 've been seeing . it ca n't just be a coincidence . will you come see her with me ? 
what for ? 
you 're breaking my ribs ! 
vince is getting desperate . where is she , <person> ? where 'd you stash her ? 
i can tell you 're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions , mr . <person> . darling ! come here . i want you to meet my wife . 
you 're living , are you ? when was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy ? when did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare ?

i like it , <person> <person> <person> . 
who ?

kimberly , it 's the senior dance .

people can hear you . 
even your fiancée ... ? 
this is no random killing , no one shot deal . the unsub has killed before ; he 's good at it . so what do we have ? we have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills : a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the fbi to know he exists . 
bleeding on a country road .

<person> laszlo . 
i got to go . 
but who is <person> , a psychiatrist . it 's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies . but why should mrs. redi , a woman with a beauty parlor -- ? 
have you ever thrown up in the front row of a <person> <person> concert ? 
he 's just playing big brother . 
and yeah , sure , <person> 's a great subject . been keeping notes on him for years for my ... great american novel . but i ca n't do it anymore . no studio 's gon na hire me and i - - 
i told him about your car .

of course not . i 'm sacking you for neglectful conduct , relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred , through your recent lack of professional judgement . a loss i trust <person> will be able to reverse . 
but you said you wanted to help -- do n't you see what it would mean ? 
instead -- you come , with sympathy , betsy , and a generous heart . do n't forget that . do n't call it nothing . 
that 's obvious , is n't it ? we have an opening for a new member . 
it 's just medication , <person> <person> , good for you . now down it goes ... 
do you have love in your heart ? 
i 'm walking .

my mother ... well , i guess it does n't matter now . she worked for gamblers . she always knew they might turn on her some day . 
how short the skirts are .

do n't take it to court , but we 've got good circumstantial evidence ... <person> agrees . my gut 's telling me <person> 's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message . 
my point , well ... 
i guess that makes sense . 
i 'm not going to think about what they 're not teaching you in school . i am not going to think about it . generally speaking i think we should rule out people who do n't live somewhere near here --

i guess so . but would n't it be better for you to wait until the old man 's here ? 
i 'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a <number> <number> dollars . 
a practical man , sir . given the marquis ' unusual tastes , a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent . 
oh -- no . i 'm just sort of disturbed about things . 
i 'm just talking on the phone to you and standing . 
because i 'm at the edge of my capabilities , <person> . 
< u > that 's < /u > why . because i could have any < u > other < /u > woman ... you know , when they asked <person> `` why england , '' he said , `` because it 's not < u > mine < /u > . '' 
i honestly do n't know . try to sleep , baby .

<person> <person> <person> <person> . 
i do n't know . she did n't leave a note . the house is all messed up .

i will . when can i come visit ? 
may your sex life be as busy as your shirt ... . 
you finish her - if you feel so much - 
sure you do . you were thinking : 'that 's no cap gun in that kid 's overcoat . ' you were thinking 'i ca n't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again . ' you were thinking : <number> 've got to find a way to distract this kid . ' so you did . it was -- in its way -- a noble act . 
it belongs to <person> <person> . he left it last time he was here . i 'm sure he would n't mind if you used it . 
that 's right ! right now ! 
oh my god . how could it happen ? 
is there something i 've said that 's caused this contempt ? or is it just the things i stand for that you despise ? 
she has it now . 
things got a lot worse . 
well , i 'd need the famous lombardo charm , not that you 'd have to do anything you have n't done already . 
only <number> men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both . 
it is . you just up and quit . there are other jobs , and they pay better money . you 're bound to be qualified for at least <number> of them . so what 's stopping you ?

where do you think i might find <person> ? 
i 'm not your boy . i do n't like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . let 's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience . 
yeah , it is . 
not yet . 
yes . 
<person> warne , you 've gone far enough . i wo n't stand being insulted like this another minute . 
the sooner you get up the lab , the sooner you 'll figure it out . 
yes . 
i have to go —- 
now , do n't be like that . tell you what . how about if i take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness ? 
hey , we got seed money for the startup ! a million-five ! 
i 'm sorry for what i said about <person> needing you . it was ... unnecessary . 
never mind ... 
rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue -- 
if i did n't go . 
you oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president , after all . 
what do you mean ? 
that 's why i picked it . we can start a whole new life down here . 
we both auditioned for the philharmonic . <number> cello position open . 
it does n't work ? ! 
assailing my fragile sense of security , that 's what . 
i do n't know ... where is she , then ? 
it 's just a puzzle box . 
yes i did ... 
buddy , what 's come over you ? a child like you , askin ' such things . 
no , they 're away for the weekend . <person> and i are watching the house . 
do what you have to do . i do n't take it personally . 
pray ? no . i communicate . 
yes . the man made a business decision . 
not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying . 
i know . [ beat ] you killed me , did n't you ? 
what ? 
what do you mean ? 
thirty ? 
velocity is the time rate of change of position . 
i wanted to thank you , woody , for saving my flock . 
orion 's belt ... 
i tell you , i 'm not interested in your opinion . 
what rumour ? 
no . she ate a pistol for lunch <number> day . 
why ? 
you have a great profile . 
bad . she could n't make the trip . you know her boy ... <person> told us before we got your letter . she 's fine ; she 's trying to get the money to come back and see you , but ... 
do n't ask . 
i 'm honored . 
i 'm choking on it . 
i hear you <person> and i appreciate it . frankly i do n't know what i 'd have done without you on this <number> . 
it was a mess . i do n't know how it got this way ... 
forget it . 
are you afraid of me ? 
that 's why it 's good you came to visit me . 
who all ended up wearing candles for faces ... <person> 's up to his ass in this somehow . guy can barely hold a drink in his hand , he 's so scared . 
oh . oh , that 's a good <number> . 
do n't leave it like that . go after him . swallow your pride . 
it 's ok ... 
put your shoulders back , i said . 
of course , not , <person> . i never thought you did . 
he wo n't be able to . he 'll have to go inside . he 'll have to see with his own eyes , whether or not i am there . if the bank closes , he wo n't know for sure . he 'll come . i 'm sure . and when he does you 'll go into the hotel , go upstairs and take the gun . 
oh . 
... it is ? 
i wanted to talk to you , and i have <number> last thing to take care of at school . then i 'm going to ... good dog , rusty . good dog . 
me and wes are just going to talk . 
i wish these people would leave already . i ca n't listen to another story . did you see him ? that doctor says the brain is coming around . they 're waiting for the heart to stabilize . i do n't know who to believe . he says they still have to keep him tied up . 
no one 's coming to get you . not while i 'm around . 
i 'm fine . you mean the board ? you mean the board ... ? 
these are nothing . you can have anything you want if you 'll only stay . what is it you want -- money ? 
until this week , that young man probably never saw a machine , let alone <number> that walks and talks ... 
december seventh , forty-one . 
yeah ? 
the same place . <number> o'clock . i have to go now . see you tomorrow . remember , i need you . 
peggy , do you know what a penis is ? stay away from it . 
some of the brown stuff is still there . 
he said that ... he 's making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and ... 
thank you , <person> <person> . 
you think you influenced her ? 
go downstairs , and tell them - anything . tell them i 'm not going . tell them i 'm not home . 
did they hurtcha ? 
but i really should get home . 
my god , what a fire ! 
yeah let 's hear about your day . 
how do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you . 
what 's the matter with you ? 
i do n't know . that 's strange . 
truck stop up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it . 
hello , <person> . 
psychologists call him a sociopath . they do n't know what else to call him . 
neither does he . that 's where he loses . this man 's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff . 
that 's fine , but did you ever think -- 
by your leave , sir . 
they believe he 's out of state by now . we 'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night . if he 's not picked up by morning -- we 'll do a house to house . 
yes , i guess you were . it - it was very thoughtful of you , <person> . 
it 's good . 
yeah . should be on the road . 
for <person> 's day , i used all my allowance that i 'd been saving to take my mother to <person> <person> . we got our nails done and had lunch at `` skies , '' a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city . it was the last outing we took together . she died the following year . 
we 'll save you a place at our table . 
do n't know much , do you ? 
they want a fuckin ' war , i 'm ready . 
... that 's what we finally decided . 
murder . 
about that luggage . where 's the phone ? 
the <person> and <person> just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt , she 's docked in bay <number> . 
good . when you are finished , come and talk to me . i have hopes for you . 
makes me want to hold on and never let go . 
who ? 
they do n't have a lot of moving parts . 
just do n't lie to me . 
fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school . teachers , students , staff , janitors ... 
dip me ! 
what do you mean ? 
what bank ? 
does it matter ? 
nah , coppers do n't do nothing , do they . 
yes , we could n't stop him . if you can find an unsigned copy , it 's worth an absolute fortune . 
or her figger . 
i guess so . 
almost negligible ... with variation of parameters , this is the answer . 
the children ... ? 
and you ? 
<number> sixes . is that any good ? 
i 'm stopping by later . i 'm worried about you . bye . 
on behalf of the teamsters ' <person> <person> , it is my pleasure to present to you . . . 
you do n't know for sure . what about <person> ? nobody 's seen him . 
what ? 
and she thinks you 're blackmailing me ? 
is that worthless brother of your there ? i want you both ta hear this . 
there ’ s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you ? 
we might as well do the towels the same way . 
just do it ! ! 
yes , sir . 
is he , <person> ? is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness ? never to know the love of a good woman , never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet , never to read <person> <person> , or marvel at a monet , or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work , smoke a pipe , and wonder about the nature of reality . 
it could have been a squirt gun . 
i 'm not the one who 's masquerading as a doctor . i 'm not the one who 's , who 's ... 
why call me ? 
to what ? where did this ship go ? where did you send it ? 
oh , that 's putting it mildly . we did everything but exchange gunshots . 
best speed to <person> <person> <person> out . <person> , i 've got to ask : any chance of getting the mains back on the line ? 
just around the corner . 
because she 's my ... my ... 
oh , better not , <person> . would n't do any good . 
he must be on his way to pee out a fire . 
what ? 
what ? 
you tell your friends your father used to work the docks . callused hands . but you had an attitude when you were growing up that was n't easy for your mother and me to understand . 
just do n't ... i 've got a headache . 
no . 
new york city ? 
what are you , some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties ? 
daddy , it 's true . 
how ... how do you know ? 
it ca n't have been easy on him . walking around with that on his conscience all these years . 
well -- it 's all right with me , <person> . let me check . i 'll get back to you . 
we only have <number> members so far , but it 's growing all the time . 
nobody . 
because i do n't like your ugly language . i heard enough of it in school ! now speak czech or english . and do n't fool around anymore . you almost got us thrown out ! 
... the ball ... continue . 
it 's for your own protection . 
oh , that 's ok , a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here . 
welcome home , <person> . 
suit me ? 
okay . you 're a good man , fergus . 
oh he forced you , huh ? 
sure ! but we think it 's kickass ! now i get to be <person> . i get to dump the glass of water on someone else 's head ! 
it 's not < u > you < /u > , it 's ... 
hell , yes ! what the hell do you expect zapping <person> <person> with that crackler ? 
you and all of the teachers in this dump -- your story 's over , so you do n't want anybody else to have fun . 
why ? 
no , i 'm not proud of myself ... but we do n't have the luxury of choice . 
everyone you know is lying . 
were they bad people ? 
<person> to say . 
what is it -- i ca n't tell anything -- 
we probably would n't mind sharing the house with people who were -- 
she thinks you 're a bucket of dog vomit . trust me on this . 
grant , as you do everything else , with treachery . offer him a truce to discuss terms , and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary . he trusts me . <person> thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along . and i will set the meeting , and the ambush . 
ted , please be careful . 
oh , i do n't know , thelma . i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays . maybe we could have children with the prison guards . 
sure . we made a buck since midday . 
yeah . that 's before the big thaw . 
ha ha . no , no , not < u > now < /u > , not < u > now < /u > , of course , but someday ... when they tell < u > this < /u > story ... 
something like that . 
he 's still very sick . please come downstairs with me . i 'll explain the situation . 
you can see it . whenever you want . do n't you , um , work at a hospital or something ? 
no -- it has to be done by tomorrow . 
if ever i meet him again , you shall see which is the best man of the <number> . i 'll fight him with sword or with pistol , captain as he is . 
what would a law firm want from the new drug <person> ? 
it is . 
okay . 
people can see this . 
i do n't wan na be you . i wan na go home . 
a new pair of panty hose . is it enough ? 
that 's why <person> called you macleod . 
you have something to say about everything ... . 
yes . i 'm now in charge of the paralegal department . 
you 're in the clear , keep it that way , i 'll be okay . 
i heard somebody been haulin ' wets on this road . 
that 's the rumor on the street . 
spare me your notions of poetry , please . we all have our assigned duties and ... 
'take a little tip from mack the knife ... ' 
<person> 's out -- i think he went to <person> <person> to see if you were hanging around there . 
who ? they 're all testifying . everybody who was in the o.r . 's going to take the stand . 
i do n't know . i 've been back and forth with <person> <person> all day , consulting with the best people in maritime medicine , the best people in viruses ... 
well , you know , all i can say is , you 're a fucking fool . 
do you have your papers , sir ? 
no -- i 'm afraid not . 
when this whole thing started you made it clear : you 're running the show . and i do n't believe you 'd be running this show if you did n't know what was going on . 
yeah , thanks . we appreciate that . 
inspector dave taylor - scotland yard ... can i have a word ? 
we 've already met . 
but of course you are . 
fine ... 
whiskey ? 
yes ... i think i can manage ... 
it 's not a date . it 's co-workers going to a professional conclave . 
i trust these men with my life . they are my right arms ; i can not insult them by sending them away . 
just play a part . a little acting . 
what did -- ? 
then bugger me ! 
oh really ? 
so ? it 's only a five-hour drive . and it 'll probably clear up , once we hit the desert . <person> , it 'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner . i promise . 
alright ! that 's it ! 
cancel , frank . 
well , that 's a relief . i understand they usually do n't let that stop them . 
alright , it ! we need it ! 
what does that mean ? 
he can live or die ... you let us in and he 's got a chance to make it . otherwise , he gets ventilated . 
yes , quite , but you should know that ... 
i do n't care if it 's dangerous ! desperate times call for desperate measures , <person> <person> . perhaps i need to remind you of your situation . 
not when you can drink instead , at least . 
yes , norma . 
forget it , <person> . 
there 's something wrong . did you tell <person> about meeting <person> ? 
yes . the eyes have it . 
you know , i 've had it up to here with your bullshit . i need a story from you by tomorrow . 
i guess not . 
i never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..you 're so different from what i..and so the same . 
i 'll figure something out ... how come you offered to drive me in this mess ? 
because you 're probably the last person i 'll ever talk to . 
i am sorry . sub-miniature photography is my hobby . it 's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative . 
like this . 
does he know that ? 
it does n't matter what you call it . i can tell you right now <person> is n't going ! 
did you look ? it was on the top shelf . 
sling . <person> <person> . what 's wrong ? 
only at the very end . 
did n't she ever tell you about that ? god , she really is pathological ... 
you know i do . i even wrote you into my will . 
that bad ? 
no bones . 
what guy ? whose apartment is this , anyway ? 
who the fuck you kidding ? send me money ! 
come on . i 'll drive you home . it 's on my way . 
you shall see . 
we 've spent a lot of time discussing those years . remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared , to the thought of the thing . thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite . 
i 'm concerned about her health . 
excuse me ? 
i expect you shortly . 
your wife , sir ? has she gone away ? 
he made a cat . 
you 'd like me to conduct my own debriefing . 
where can i find him ? 
now make a right , you 'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility . the bowels of the ship . 
dr. <person> , the man we want was never your patient . it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence . <person> , doctor - time is eating us up . just show me the ones you 've turned away . 
what was the matter with it ? 
-- and i try and teach the students to ask : what is it in aid of ? 
the piano on the beach ? <person> 's piano ? 
i want him ! 
well ... well , that 's wonderful , <person> . 
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply ? 
you wish . 
life is waiting . 
tuesdays and thursdays . but after <person> <person> , i 'm yours . 
nothing . no footsteps coming up the stairs . no hovercraft out the window . no clickity click of little spyders . no one crashing through that door . and do you know why i do n't hear any of those things , <person> ? because right now , the precogs ca n't see . 
long ago . now there is nothing : the men killed each other in family vendettas ... the others escaped to america . 
... be with her ... 
new worlds . <person> <person> , brave new worlds ... 
well , then , how about a ruler ? 
something like that . 
i can give you many political answers <person> but the truth is that <person> is not worth a single vote to all of them : french , british , americans . 
on the contrary ! the puling , pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting . now you are splendid ... a fierce goddess ... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful . 
oh ... well , i 'm very sorry ... 
you do n't wear garters ! 
you <number> better quit it . 
there are still things i have to do . 
oh , no . i 'm tryin ' to get off this island alive . i 'll help you all i can but i 'm not goin ' in there on a suicide mission . what can you hope to accomplish ? some radios maybe ? a supply room or <number> ? you 'll all be killed and in a few weeks they 'll be back to business as usual . that place was built to withstand nuclear attack ! what are you gon na do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro ? 
jesus , that 's in chinatown , ai n't it ? 
it never works out because i 'm into legs and butts and hair myself ! that 's why ! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking , but even more shallow than i am , if you can picture that . now , if you 'll excuse me , i have to go find another low-paying , demeaning job where some guy named <person> keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is . 
no , man , i 'm doing okay . thanks . 
i do n't think that 'll be necessary . let 's all have a seat . <person> , why do n't you be nice and get coffee for everybody . 
<person> jeremy and <person> <person> <person> of st. ursula 's , and our associate , <person> <person> . secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified . maya is eminently qualified . 
i 'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning , wanting to know what 's going on , i 'm going to lie to them ! 
i -- uh , i ... well , there is no place cards or anything . 
that 's your proof ? 
y' got ta , y' got ta . but d'ya think they 'll kick ransom for that little prick , assuming we get to 'm . 
no . just stop everything . 
i ca n't take my eyes off you . 
hello ... . oh , just a minute . police department ? 
you like it ? 
well , when i first came to washington , my eyes were big , blue question marks -- now they 're big , green dollar marks -- 
it 's no use , dr. grant . no use . 
my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet . 
you know that was like a quadruple negative ? 
< u > you < /u > know ... <person> 's your bathroom ? 
you 're talking about the woman i love . 
sixty seconds , then i 'm out of here . 
we 're back at the beginning . i still do n't know the why . a planet where apes evolved from men . a world turned wrong side up . a puzzle with <number> piece missing . 
i 'll try to manage . 
i know it 's crazy , but -- i ca n't just leave . do n't argue with me . if i 've learned anything , it 's that the problems of <number> people do n't add up to a hill of ants in this world . or beans . something like that . <person> , i 've < u > got to warn the others < /u > . 
good . anything else ? 
i 'm tellin ' you the man 's in love ... he wants to be a hero for his girl . 
just do n't move around too much . 
how about what ? 
no one 's waiting . 
how do you do , sir . 
no , you ca n't . and i 'll tell you this -- he scares me . as kind as he is , he scares me . you ca n't fool around with him , not with that man . and , boy , i sure better not try nothin ' like that with him again , he 'll fire me . 
you know how people with broken bones know when there 's a storm coming ? 
no -- i 'm afraid not . 
i 'm telling you , they changed it ! 
no i 'm not ! 
i got it . 
well , it all comes back , in just a jiffy . i 'm working on a wall-hanging , of the convent . 
i will . but i must find the right moment . 
fuck , i love mexico . i live like a king down here . 
you do n't know that . 
yeah , look at that thing . 
do n't get too far ! 
ah , i can smell it on you . 
i feel much better . thank you . 
no , i do n't believe this shit -- it 's a microphone . <person> , she 's wired ... 
look . 
up north . 
not anymore . 
what if i told you he did this to me ? 
<person> 's dead . 
i 'll give you plenty of rings as soon as i get the stones set -- what do you think ? 
what ? 
what the hell happened to you guys ? 
up the coast . 
you walked in . i saw you . do n't you remember ? 
am i ... am i dead ? 
you 're paranoid , <person> . 
so i 'll see you at the rehearsal . 
i just called to say that i 'm having a really great time . 
man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer , he ca n't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear . 
what hurts <person> ? 
a drink . 
how bad was the unicorn 's wound ? 
this is a lot of money . 
it ’ s my father ’ s pin . he wore it everyday of his life . 
<person> , <person> . rolling . 
that 's why i 'm calling , <person> <person> ... 
because he 's probably dead . his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere ... eyes gauged . see , the police are always off track with this shit , if they 'd watch prom night they 'd save time . there 's formula to it . a very simple <number> . everyone 's always a suspect -- the father , the principal , the town derelict ... 
splendid . 
and sweet ? 
the plague to end all plagues , <person> <person> . a silent weapon for a quiet war . the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . they 've been working on this for fifty years . while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned <person> . 
<person> cured , yeah , that was read out to us . the inspector read all that out to us . he said it was a very good way . 
are you ? 
what about it ? 
i 've offended you ! 
hot coffee or iced coffee ? 
that 's right . 
i ca n't tell you . 
if you did n't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we 'd have been through with breakfast by this time . 
why do n't you ride anymore ? <person> told me you used to ride when she was younger . 
<person> becker ? she sits next to me in english . 
no , sir . <person> put , i never expect to sleep again . 
hey , it 's just a vestigal response to procreation ... bitch . 
yes . 
i know that <person> but look at my side . you undersigned the loans . you vouched for him . what happens if this kid do n't pay me ? i got ta collect from you ? i do n't want to do that . i made a deal with him not you , right ? 
alvy , i ca n't say that that 's true at this point in my life . i really just ca n't say that that 's true . i mean , you know how wonderful you are . i mean , you know ... you 're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing , and-and- and , you know , get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap . <person> , look , i do n't wanna- <person> , listen , listen , uh h'h , so whatta you up to anyway , huh ? 
i just want to get my people home . i know who you are and what you could do to me if i do n't honor my word . 
points very straight to her . 
i wanted to ask you because you 're a doctor , right ? 
they 're in the ignition , silly . 
lotta scratch-marks on your door ? 
i do n't think he 'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check . i 've been through this a hundred times . 
i do n't know , i have n't looked . you know me and blood . 
baby , you 're scaring me . 
bond , i ’ m a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ’ s , now it ’ s mine . i run my little business , i stay out of trouble ... 
yeah , sweetheart ? 
she did ? 
f-f-fuck you . 
i moved the couch . that 's all . 
how much i got , what ? 
for a pack of cigs ? i use her food stamps . 
you do n't know . 
let 's get out of here . 
they 're bad for you . they cause ... red lips . 
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there was n't any reason , they were so far ahead . but <person> was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in . 
sure - 
ai n't it there ? 
what ? 
ai n't nobody havin ' *sex* with my little girl , homer -- that 's somethin ' a father knows . 
and almost got tossed out of the academy ... 
patience . concentrate . you will find a way . 
it 'll do fine . 
< u > then explain it to me < /u > . i got enough darkness , do n't i ? 
jerk . here i am , throwing myself at you , succumbing to your wily charms , and you call me a slut , in so many words . 
no . 
there 's no replacement 'cause of your boss ' cuts , if that 's what you mean . if someone else goes out on an injury we 're really screwed . 
but why would <person> want me ? 
will you stay here with us for a long time ? 
it 'll be okay . 
i knew you could handle it . 
she left a note . 
but not right next to each other . i thought that 's what you meant . 
do n't get my hopes up . if i quit , what then ? i ca n't go through this again . 
pretty bad . 
drink this . 
rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns . 
<person> has been packing since morning , <person> <person> . 
no . 
i love your early work . `` was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium ? '' 
no sir ... 
getting rid of my hub ! 
stop it ! 
well good . just confirming . you 'll be on the <number> wednesday afternoon . 
are you sad ? are we going to church ? for your confession ? 
long time ago . 
listen , if you 'll promise not to do it , i 'll pay you . i 'll pay you as much as he will . you wo n't gain anything by giving me away as long as i 'm willing to make it worth your while . i 've got to get to new york without being stopped . it 's terribly important to me . i 'd pay now , only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes . i 'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york . 
what 's he doing out there ? 
tons 
they 'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain . 
very funny . i saw you out there on lane <number> . what do you have the flu or something ? 
i 'll come with you . 
so ? 
... huh ? 
who ? 
no death certificates . no crime . 
there ai n't . 
that 's right . 
we are the all-singing , all-dancing crap of the world . we are all part of the same compost heap ... 
no ... not yet ... 
anything , auggie . just name it . 
what ? ... oh , no , thx . that 's not true . not satisfied ? thx , i need you so much . 
hey , <person> , thanks . 
better . 
did you close the door ? 
i 'm on the last page . how do you spell conscience ? 
well now , <person> , i 'm gon na tell you something for your own good , only first gim me a cigarette . 
he gambles ... he likes a good time ... i see him around ... . 
i 'm not letting go of him . 
i say it because it 's descriptive . 
piano . <person> got away , disappeared into toontown . nobody ever saw him again . 
you mean <person> <person> , the old timer ? he does n't know much . 
check your code again . no one at base would pull a stunt like that , <person> . 
<person> <person> <person> on . 
no you 're right . once again . you 're a decent man , <person> . 
even tough i do n't talk to her every day -- i still talk to her every day . know what i mean ? 
boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew ... 
why do n't you leave him alone ? 
they stole the phones . 
dad , it takes time . you got ta build a customer list . i 'm doing it . i could make more money in <number> year as a broker than <number> years at the airline . 
well , if it 's any comfort , i 's goin ' in to there to act a fool baby . <person> rockin ' heat and slayin ' niggas -- 
no . not everything . 
<person> , this is kind of an official meeting 
i know . it was the same when i was carrying <person> . like clockwork . 
oh no , <person> , that 's not obvious enough . not at all . <person> , did you hear that ? 
so avoid using the word 'very ' because it 's lazy . a man is not very tired , he is exhausted . do n't use very sad , use morose . <person> was invented for <number> reason , boys -- to woo women -- and , in that endeavor , laziness will not do . it also wo n't do in your essays . 
you got aspirins ? i have something ... not aspirins , but my mother 's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding . <person> was furious when he found out i 'd taken tranquilizers ! 
you ? ! how about me ? 
well , when <person> came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds , i went to the safe and gave him -- out of this whole fortune -- i happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me -- banks have to keep track of hundreds . if the money had been in fifties , or if i 'd grabbed a different stack , there probably would n't have been any watergate story . 
why me ? 
my soul , woman . i give you <number> murders and you are n't satisfied . 
and <person> 's pre-med . 
through a rental agency . 
nice surprise . 
i think that is its hand . 
you spend the afternoon in bed ? 
there are some rumors ... 
well , if she looked like you -- say ! my brains and your looks -- that might n't be such a bad combination . 
you 've been working out . 
that 's what i said eighteen months ago . 
i promise . i will never let go , <person> . i 'll never let go . 
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed . 
let it go , <person> , trust me . 
where to ? 
what your husband was mixed up in . 
so mentally ill ? 
refresh my memory . 
he was a nice horse . 
bookshelf . sensors -- 
how beautiful . 
it so happens , my dear simple sir , that the head of medical records at the castle < u > is < /u > <number> of the directors of this firm . 
why ? 'cause i ... was walkin ' along a block behind you staring at you ? that 's not following ! 
well , thirty-three , but i 'm not counting <person> , on account of you ... so , what do you think ? you probably feel i 'm flattering myself to see us together . 
she 's gone ! 
yes . 
what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . <person> <person> is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that . 
that makes a change . 
come on , you can make it . 
kept calling it `` murder '' when i did it . 
you 've asked me that <number> <number> times . 
they love you , <person> . keep it up . 
why not here ? 
<person> <person> 's dead . guess he was n't as lucky as we thought . 
what are you saying -- we ca n't stop what 's out there ? 
there is something i must ask the gods ... 
we can do that ? 
heroes ai n't supposed to shake . i 'm shakin ' , man , look at me . 
now go out there and show your dad what you can do . 
well why did n't you say so ? you want me to lift some weights or something ? 
you broke in ? 
take it easy . what 's goin ' on anyway ? why are you in so much trouble ? 
what 's in all the bags ? 
maybe . 
fred . <person> ? he 's ... actually he 's been on an extended vacation , and -- 
that 'll happen when you 're about to spend thirty <number> dollars on some aspirin ... 
your warehouse ? go on ahead -- to your `` warehouse . '' i 'll be okay ... 
nay , <person> , tis not what you 're thinking . 
you still got a map on you ? 
you ca n't cheat an honest man . but a man like lionel dolby ... 
h 'm ? 
no . it 's you who does n't understand , <person> . <person> has come to kill and destroy . we brought him here . we must stop him . 
i have to go . 
on the durham road . the pantiles . 
seatbelts fastened , please . 
put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole -- 
what are ya tellin ' me , <person> ? 
is this really the time ? 
about what ? 
not much chance of that . <person> 's an idiot . 
you do recognize it then ? 
he went home sick . 
you do ? 
oh , your grace - i thank your grace ! i thank you ! 
<person> , <person> , cooper , any of you in the airlock ? 
<number> <number> dollars , dino . how much did he tell you he had ... 
wallace 's ? for treason there is no trial . tomorrow he will be charged , then executed . 
he 's already been . 
i do n't want to be childish , i 'd settle for just a few years- 
i guess it would n't hurt . 
<number> ? 
work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it . 
she 's asleep . 
what would you say if i told you that you were going to the homecoming dance tomorrow night ? 
can i trust you , <person> ? 
think he still thinks about her . but not like then . then was an obsession . 
as a tumor . 
me too . 
no , girletta , i do n't leave your side . 
is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is ... ? 
he did n't look like he 'd take that sitting down . 
thank-q ! 
what the hell are you doin ' with <person> 's gun ! ? 
<person> said witches live there . 
i see . 
give 'em my number . 
that 's good ... 
what is it ? ! 
they 're all the same , but each <number> is different from every other <number> . you 've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings . you 've got your summer light and your autumn light . you 've got your weekdays and your weekends . you 've got your people in overcoats and galoshes , and you 've got your people in shorts and t-shirts . sometimes the same people , sometimes different ones . and sometimes the different ones become the same , and the same ones disappear . the earth revolves around the sun , and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle . 
move it out . 
well , maybe we should n't go out to dinner . i do n't want to ruin your willpower . 
oh ? 
most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes , mr <person> - confused and frightened victims . it ’ s all too easily discredited , you understand . now , you might be just what we ’ ve been waiting for . your information could be enough to make ‘ em sit up and listen . 
what ? ! 
doctor ? what could be wrong wit ' you ? 
i 'm the one who found his perforating proboscis ! are you wearing a gun , right now ? ooh , cool ! can i see it ? can i ? 
for <person> , schmuck . bring your kid something . you know . the dad thing . 
go out there ! find somebody , ask some questions ! i 'm sorry if i seem over-anxious to you . i keep thinking ... something 's wrong . i have to know what ! 
you 're not jealous , are you ? you have to understand ... <person> and i had this strange , intense ... experience together . 
yes ! this is about me . why ca n't you understand that , you of all people ? it 's not the war -- it 's <person> ! they want to destroy <person> ! and if i expose myself even the slightest bit they 'll tear my insides out . do you want that ? do you want to see that , <person> ? it 's not pretty . 
yeah , and needless to say , none of us has that kind of money lying around . 
would n't go that far . 
and why did n't <person> tell < u > us < /u > ? does n't he trust women ? that fuck . 
i said that the file is incomplete . 
stop it ! 
do n't give me a hard time <person> ! you do n't want to get me mad ! you 're coming with me ! 
i could n't say , which <number> ? 
i got a nurse in mind . 
tell me something , wes . are you crazy , greedy , or just stupid ? <person> says you 're crazy . 
rather an obvious question under the circumstances , do n't you agree ? a better one might be how do you feel ? 
no , it 's not that ... 
<person> , it 's not so easy . there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris . it 's a whole other city , crawling with drug addicts , lunatics , skinheads ... it 's no man 's land . 
that is idle talk . 
i am not like my mother ! 
no , sandro ... we should go . besides , we have n't been in touch with anybody . not even with <person> 's father . we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned ... let 's be fair , he must be feeling awfully lonely . 
jeff for senator . 
just hold me . 
lem me tell it , <person> . 
the thing that really got to me ... she did n't leave a note . nothing . i 've always hated her for that . 
that 's not it . that ship was built to go faster than light ... that 's just wrong , it goes against everything we know ... 
i 've read they 're using it to repair cancer cells . 
this conversation is finished . 
i love you , too , <person> . 
myers has been locked up since before she was born . he 's never laid eyes on her . 
who is this , in the mask ? who is he ? 
he 's dead ? 
i got some hair stuff . 
forget it . <person> ship . 
got a handshake like a partially excited penis . 
that 's probably all he can do . 
yes . 
i do n't want to read . 
bring it closer so that i might join with it . do it , or watch these puny things die horribly . 
since i stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do , you 're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go , these days ? 
oh . 
you 're a dirty pig ! 
cobb , you 've got nothing i need . 
if that was all , fine . but carving him up , stranding the others , that 's too fucking much . is everything that walks , crawls , flies or swims fair game to you ? 
i guess not , <person> . i do n't like guns around . 
i was married to her sister .. 
hold onto this . 
could be <person> 's . 
i 'm not good enough to write it alone . we 'll have to do it together . 
how come ? 
they 're dumb , somebody ... i do n't know ... 
you people ... rich people ... 
your dance is over . 
<person> ? 
many villagers are hiding in the forest . they need food . 
it 's like she 's waiting for something . 
when are they coming ? 
danny ! 
what 's the recovery ? how much are you looking for ? 
so you fucked a student ? ! 
in the real world , when you get to where i am , there are other considerations ... 
what about you ? 
it 's frogs . it 's raining frogs . 
huh ? 
no . no , it 's ok . i ... it 's my father . 
linda does n't come in nights . 
she 's even taken a job as a nurse ! <person> <person> 's getting boring , <person> . 
do you believe i love you ? 
let 's move out ! 
uh-huh . 
absolutely . and <person> <person> has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall . 
you always said you wanted to live in a palace . 
you said `` here 's what < u > they < /u > want you to do ... '' why ? 
so . we 're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the spec-recon training . it may not always be smooth , but we 're trying to make it as painless as possible for you . 
it 's a promise ? 
why not ? but that 's not how things wound up . i 'm with <person> , <person> 's your friend . and there it ends . 
anything -- anything . -- you can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle ! 
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king <person> ... 
she was the last person seen with the guy -- i 'll take the responsibility . 
charming guy , <person> . once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but- 
<person> , ma'am . 
no way . 
and yet he attacked us . and told the ba'ku we were a threat ... 
but i was dusting . 
agnes you wo n't burn in hell . it 's alright to hate him . 
chulo , <number> thing at a time . 
nah , this 'll be fine . 
i guess we 've never been introduced proper . <person> <person> . 
los angeles . 
<person> christ , i 'm getting a boner just looking at it . 
yes . 
they 're off now . 
we had a deal . remember that ? he said if it did n't work out between us , that i could get my things and i could leave . 
rekall ? 
no , private , i want you to stay here , keep your head down , do n't do anything brave or stupid . 
you ruined my life , <person> ... me and my wife ... and i am going to ruin yours ... you do n't have to go out there to see that girl . we been going <number> years . <number> years ... my wife 's been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister . 
< u > we 're gon na find the body < /u > , <person> . <person> , you 're a cop . why am i tellin ' you this ? we got ta go down and find it . 
do you know how much i missed you ? 
sure . 
so you eat -- read it everyday ? 
not here ... alone . may we ? please ? 
point <number> <number> . we can walk on it . 
jesus , <person> , this is a league match , for god ’ s sake ! 
no , i guess not . it was pretty lousy of me , i guess , to be a child at the same time you were . not to stop being a child just because i had a child . i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up . 
sure i do . do i know what loneliness feels like ? sure i do . i know a lot about it , if that 's what you mean . 
i think you 're here all day . 
no , i 'm warning you ! who do you think you are , <person> ? you bumble around with your folders ... ... and your pencils ... ... and your god-damn buttons ... ... all your badges of authority ! but you have no authority ! you 're nothing ! you 're a zero ! 
that 's it ? 
you boost her -- ? 
i 'll come a-running , pardner . 
this all has something to do with <person> , does n't it ? 
enough with the clothes -- 
no ? 
why do n't you come back with me ? 
what doing ? 
sometimes it 's best to keep a few things just for ourselves . 
oh , <person> . 
is the wind tired out there ? 
streets , sunlight . when was the last time i saw sunlight . 
in case i need it ? 
what if i take you with me ? 
<person> . 
oh , and i forgot to tell you . he 's here with his mother . 
now , do n't be paranoid , <person> . about the direction of research here , we may have had our differences of opinion ... 
you see , from this vertebrae i shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton . 
who is <person> ? 
great . 
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs . 
how did you know that ? 
`` you ca n't always get what you want ! '' that 's a great title for a song ! i 'm gon na write that , and it 'll be a big hit . 
oh no . i have no plans . 
i never killed anybody before . i talk a good game , but i 'm not like that . 
yes ! they 'll be in soon . 
i mean , it was as if there were <number> razors cutting her at the same time . but invisible razors . she just ... opened up ... 
about those colorful metaphors we discussed . i do n't think you should try to use them . 
oh . 
mm . 
you are looking for a place to stay , no , <person> ? 
i love your sister , <person> . i love her very much . 
you have the largest penis . can we go please ? 
i . . . 
no . i 'm not badly injured . but my leg is very sore . 
very much . 
everybody 's got a job to do . figure it this way : at least you get to go home alive . 
no trouble . 
<person> mary and come inside . 
he is now . 
tuna . 
you 're a good man , <person> <person> -- a very good man . 
and you wanted him to make a list ! 
it goes fast , all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast , <person> , i will have a new job . singing soprano with the vienna boys ' choir . 
it 's worth it to me . 
th-th-they , they wanted me for a screen test . 
say , who 's been tying your ties lately ? it looks rotten . 
should blow you away , you know that ? 
what 's wrong with it ? 
what word would you use , <person> ? 
no tricks , <person> . you have <number> minute . 
try to look at it *this* way . <person> and i are sitting right here beside you . we could have ended up in the incinerator ! 
you press a button , norman . it 's not brain surgery . here , go ahead . you only have <number> minutes to reset it . go on , norman ... 
you opened the thing ? 
can i have milk too ? 
okay , <person> , but i want it right back . it belongs to my father . 
he 's carrying her off now through the woods . 
um . there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make <person> <person> in command . 
i-i c-ca n't ... 
show me just <person> 's data stream . 
new <person> brought her back to the bus through heavy fire . quite a guy if you want my opinion . 
oh shit it 's my cell ! 
well , i 'm good , i do n't know if i 'm best . 
well , then you know what i 'm talking about . <person> , here 's the story . i scored with these <number> chicks . <person> story . 
fuck the bonus . i hate heights . you would n't get me up there even if it was n't night . 
yes . of course.. 
why ? 
dead cat ? 
there 's plenty of fruit . 
how do you know ? 
-- go ahead . 
yeah . anyway , there are n't any photographers around . 
so work must be going well ? 
i was thinking , <person> , maybe . 
enjoy your kenworth . 
out where ? 
oh ... you mean you do n't want to . 
the music ? or the fire ? 
seeing my home planet from space for the first time ... 
this has to happen fast . 
-- buddy , it 's bigger than that , they want 'em all , <person> , <person> -- 
i had 'em too . i burnt those <number> starky and hutch motherfuckers down . then their asses lucked out and found that coke . 
spanish passports ? 
nah ... 
well , physiologically , he ... wo n't quite fit . 
well , first , you got to change the title ... 
why is n't it doing anything ! ? 
who told you that ? 
the old man will never bring in the new year . 
quick question - do you know who i am ? 
just me . 
screw it . we been earning our keep as respectable knife artists . why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle ? 
i do n't know . sometimes i think he 's pretty much a ghost . 
i know . 
that 's it . a great wheel that gives us each what we deserve ... 
ropes ? 
no . 
take a guess ... < u > let him guess < /u > ! ! < u > tch < /u > . 
i 'm falling ! i 'm going to fall ! 
what ? 
you watch the draft this year ? 'course you did n't , idiot question . they try to make it dramatic , like there 's some big surprise who picks who in the first round ? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months . <person> 's reports , highlight reels , coaches ' evaluations , psychological profiles -- hell , i would n't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys , have 'em analyzed . all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad . compared to that , what you know about the person you get married to do n't amount to diddly , does it ? 
eighteen ! that 's <number> years ! what about the play ? the performance is tomorrow night ! 
any untoward `` revelation '' regarding , uh ... 
you 're not fbi agents . 
he knows . he knows ! 
lois please . 
yes . 
but <person> ... you ca n't fly . 
me , too . 
good ! well there 's still hope . lots of hope . 
i want to make it up to you . <person> , put all your clients in it . 
<person> ' to remember somethin ' somebody once told me about tyin ' a fly . 
no . you 're not specific enough to be a person . you 're more like a vibe . 
you stink , <person> ! 
of course , my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her . and how strange it must be for you to be here , away from your family and everything you know . 
what 's interesting about a butcher 's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper ? 
where 's your shell collection ? 
why should i go against you , <person> ? nobody can handle this business like you . <person> 'll never know the crap that you forget . he 's got no business bein ' <person> . the idea makes me wan na puke . you 're the boss , an it 's gon na stay that way . 
for a man in my position -- 
if i 've got any sense i 'm going to call headquarters . 
no , i see her around the pool . i know her . i know her like that -- not like that . 
later . 
cut those men down . congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial . <person> , trust me to handle this . 
and what of the enterprise ? 
you were meant to you 're <number> of those fortunate people that good things happen to . 
i noticed . <person> , anybody home ? 
i have about fifteen hundred <number> at this point . i 've tried to pare down my collection to the essential ... 
guard ! ! ! 
they are evil , cursed , they matter not . 
keep steady . you 're the best shots of the twenty-fourth . you bunch of heathens , do it 
i 'm sick and i 'm in love . 
oh yes ! yeah , man , give her the ride , the ol ' pony ride back to the hotel . 
it did ? 
and he is n't struck dead ! this man , he lives ! it would be interesting to know , young man , where and when you studied anatomy . 
well , how about these <number> movies ? 
michael , calm down . please . it 's ok . 
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand-boy . and if you refused , it was n't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that 's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege . 
oh , you know exactly what i mean , honey ? it 'd make the future so simple and nice . 
tweaked the phosphor rod , modified the collimated beam , wan na concentrate the light , get something like a uv laser going . 
what makes you think we can get back in ? we do n't have the fuel for this . maverick just get me to him . 
i try ... 
<person> katharine say ? - <person> has to fly back to cairo . 
how do you do ? 
yes . 
did you know that if you shut someone up in a room , and the only clock he has reference to runs <number> hours slow for every twenty-four , that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule ? simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four , the body follows . and then there are sections of time . your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . for instance , when i was twelve , i had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship . now , i 'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time , but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to , and then were crystallized in , that eleven minutes . 
no . 
we also provide <number> after-sale service . were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die , we would unburden you , you understand ? 
you got a vision , girl . just like i got . just like my momma had . and the good <person> did n't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures . that 's just wasted time . 
nah , it was a premeditated act . the sex , i mean , not getting pregnant . 
yo , i 'm gone . 
you know who they are ? 
you would n't get it . just a private joke between best friends . 
not yet , not yet ... 
yeah . 
oh , do n't be stupid . 
what are you saying ? that i killed her or something ? 
i let her take a shower . 
-- i find it degrading . <person> gynecology and minimum turn-on -- 
you 're not a kid anymore . 
do what you want , it 's a free country . 
you do n't remember me ... .. i 'm <person> <person> . 
lois ! 
tell me about it . 
oh , yeah , you had to go to highgate . that must 've been intense . 
either way , they must 've had a pretty good reason . 
yes . 
so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; <person> flips out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring <person> and <person> into the cover story -- 
i really do n't know . i do n't live there . i was just visiting ... a grave . 
spare your energy . i 'll be back ! 
yeah . how 's mom ? 
what was that all about ? 
no you do n't . 
`` the nomm '' ? what 's that ? 
sure , frankie . fuck me . <person> <person> . <person> <person> <person> who 's made us all rich . all so you can be an fuckin ' honorary sicilian ! 
that 's a date . 
golly . who 's paying for this ? 
... thanks . 
oh my god ! ! 
just do n't shoot me . 
yeah , you just do everything they say ! you 'll be in daddy 's law firm as sure as i 'm standing here . and you 'll be approving loans till you croak . 
was i ? 
look ... my daughter ... she 's going to die ... unless you can help me . 
i 've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow . 
speak to this lad , <person> , ... to <person> <person> . 
so reel him in . but we came here to do a < u > job < /u > . so let 's do it . < u > quickly < /u > . 
it 's something in that hydraulic pump . 
sounds respectable . 
i 'm afraid it 's not very frightening . they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally , as i understand it , <number> of the gods comes down and speaks through <number> of the people . 
would you like to talk about this friend ? 
but i would be <person> and silvia too . good nurse , god save you and good night . i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players . 
where do our records go to in the castle ? 
i 'm a hemotologist , sir , i was asked only t ... 
i did ? 
but , i am not alone , am i ? i only wished to see what you were up to , and ... to thank you . 
do you know how they were damaged ? 
i 'm still waiting for the mortgage check . 
'at's-a no good . i went to <person> <person> once . 
-- he was wearing <number> of our jackets . 
no , no , i was n't trying . 
i just want to know while we were seeing each other ... i just do n't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing ... 
i think you 're sweet . 
would i hire you ? 
what kind of symbol ? 
i hope it was n't cheap . 
what were you gon na say ? go ahead . 
they stamped it , didnít they ? those damn gideons . 

your father should keep you better informed . he has bought me for you . he returns from his estates to see us married <number> weeks from saturday . you are allowed to show your pleasure . 
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile . 
i believe you . i really do . 
oh , i remember bits and pieces of all of'em i guess..halle , of course..i had <person> a lifetime . almost <number> years ... my <number> girls , sold and gone before i could even a heard about it , and them without their grown up teeth yet . my third child , my son after halle ... i let that straw boss have me for <number> months so 's i could keep that boy . next year , he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child . i could n't love that child . i would n't . not any of the rest either . god take what he would ... .and he did ... 
bye , house . 
thanks for the walk . maybe we could ... get a bite sometime ? 
why does he want to kill me ? 
where did you get it ? ! 
no , i 'm not . 
i 'm sorry . i did n't want to sound cynical . but is n't it better to look things squarely in the eye ? 
you ca n't do that yourself ? 
i only wanted to see as others do ... feel as others do ... ... but <person> could not help me . nor <person> ... 
say who ? 
<number> last thing hammer . you take care of yourself . the ... 
i do n't have all day . 
ha ! what a load of crap . look at yourself , <person> . you 're a thug . |you launder money for the mob . you rent women like you rented this apartment . 
i 'm <person> 's aunt lisa . 
did i ? 
you ever think about it ? you ever worry ? 
i 'm going to stick it out here . we still have a shot . 
they love you , <person> . they need you , too . 
and second ? 
what made it ... 
did we get our bill yet ? 
it 's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor , delivery man -- it could have blown in through an open window . 
well , yes , it 's just a manner of speech from your post corrective advisor to you that you watch out , little <person> . he puts his arm round <person> 's shoulder .

her suit 's gone . 
i must say you 're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea . 
what happened ? 
and then she mentioned penis envy ... did you know about that ? 
i 'm an open target , <person> . if you 're with me -- 
yeah , baby ... 
what makes you say that ? 
il signor <person> ha una fidanzata , il signor <person> ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor <person> <person> ha molte fidanzate . 
be sorry for nothing . 
discourage it . but stay with her if you ca n't . call it in first so we can have a car on tail . she 's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine ... okay , let 's check it out . 
until she rots and lie stinking in the earth . 
<person> , what about the bathtub ? 
what 's that stand for ? 
i do n't think so . i guess this is my own war . 
indeed , <person> <person> , i intend to have his blood as sure as my name 's <person> . 
no . 
you have heard your answer , <person> le <person> . 
that 's the order of business . your <person> has to stand *way* back there in line unless the steering committee decides it is important enough to be -- 
the name should be <person> . what should my name be ? 
were it only that easy . i have obligations . the order needs to be filled ... 
i 'm here . 
i supposed you 'd like a leg . how about <number> ? 
big time .

children are never satisfied . i have my house , my friends , my job ... my life , <person> . i have to live it . besides , i 'll be back . now show your mother what a good dancer you are . 
here 's a news flash , <person> . we never were friends . we 've just been stuck together for <number> years . it 's been nothing but bad luck since the moment i ran into you . every time i look at you i get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if i 'd never bumped into <person> <person> . 
she 's an adult , mrs. hillyer , i was merely giving her the facts . 
i need a large polo mallet ! 
you want to do this yourself ? i do n't have to do this , you know . 
no , i want long shifts . 
you 're calling < u > lydia < /u > in < u > my < /u > office . you must think i 'm some dope . you fuckin ' bastard ... you ... ... stay out all night long ... 
no , <person> . 
you said it ! 
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression . it is a time when an individual will act over-confident , and will act out impractical , grandiose plans . sometimes these plans can be dangerous . 
now , <person> -- 
i could take it or leave it . 
she 's young . she 'll get over it . 
why ? 
but you looked so cute . all sleepy ... 
well , what are you then ? 
i understand that . i 'm sorry to hear that . we 'd be well advised to deal with this situation now . the insurance company - - 
i got a lot of free time , you know what i mean ? 
simple . they do n't want him to go . 
i speak what i feel . 
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds ! they took the idols and smashed them . the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos . and who have they got now ? some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl 
what do you want me to say ? 
that bastard ! 
yes ? 
oh , well ... er brave concorde ! you shall not have been fatally wounded in vain ! 
i 'm sorry . of course . you 're very welcome . 
huh . i ’ d have thought a tough guy like you would know better . the sick ones are out there , friend . they make up the clientèle . get rid of them and we ’ re out of business . 
i-i-i mean , i 'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in brooklyn . 
what do you want me to say ? 
perhaps it wasn ’ t so brave of him . had i been here i just might have given him his money , mr lombard . <number> can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct , as someone in your line of work ought to know . 
oh . 
all right . 
what did you say ? 
double merde . 
well , somebody better go tell the damn yankees ! 
... the rain falls ... 
stop squawking ! you were doing this job on a ship <number> years ago when i first picked you up , were n't you ? 
you 're on your way up , buddy-boy . and you 're practically out of liquor . 
then we do n't know if she 's part of this or not . <person> , you up ? 
doug ... 
okay . <person> . hold that thought just for a second . they only call me when it 's an emergency . just hold that thought . can you call back ? 
i do n't know guys ... i mean , he almost looked ... sincere . i know , it 's bizarre ! 
hippy , you think everything 's a conspiracy . 
of course they 're dead . they 're ghosts . 
you personally ? 
take them and put them in a safe place . 
will you stay here for the night ? you can leave in the morning . that 's when my parents get back and -- 
what does that mean ? what does he do ? 
she wo n't stop crying ... 
oh , that 's taken care of . i called the state attorney 's office . you were no-filed this morning in circuit court . 
maybe not even that , <person> . i thought once that you were the <number> to unite the land under <number> sword . but it 'll take another , a greater king ... 
no marty , i do n't . 
and so i always manage to , do you see ? like the book/script thing , do you see ? 
marky , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , and brian . 
right . bring him back . 
it has nothing to do with you . 
perhaps this evening , <person> , we could go to the casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights ? 
ted , do you love him ? 
it is truly , what ’ s the word ? inspiring . 
... why do n't i just type this up ... 
not for long . not when they do a fingerprint check . 
did you muss up her hair by accident , too ? 
er ... pray tell me why ? 
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your -- 
yeah . 
my secretary saw you with that boy . 
i do n't know . we just did . i guess i was kind of scared going against the gain . against the whole town . 
not as bad as i thought it would . i think i passed . 
kip and i 'd probably be working at the dealership ... imagine us selling cars ? 
oh man , that kid takes himself real serious . 
not much . 
what 's the assignment ? 
and do n't be so obvious ! 
what 's going on ? 
come on . there we go . look at that . <person> . 
yes . 
yeah , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ? 
my first name 's -- clarissa . 
did your voices tell you that ? you told me you had n't heard them for months ... 
there ! gravity field ... it 's big ! 
-- and unlike the first <number> , every second of it 's gon na be true ! `` <person> <person> : the real story ! '' 
i 'm sorry i could n't be there for you , sweetheart . 
rod , get on the camel . 
hell they do n't . i met my first wife that way .

you 're my woman , you understand ? you do n't let anybody take you away from me without a fight . 
do n't be offended , major . our president holds the same views . 
and things sort of just went downhill from there . 
meanwhile whatever you do do n't fall asleep . midnight . 
i guess so . i think that 's right . 
yeah , bring us <number> fernet . 
<person> ! <person> <person> ! why you 're so ... middle aged !

you 're going to the soho grand hotel , right ? 
he 's in jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old . a friend of my daughter 's . he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off , so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go , minus a ten percent commission . <person> reminds me . can you make sure you give me a <number> ? i want to frame it and put it on the wall .

insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us . 
do n't get all gooey on me now , you 'll give me a big head . the important thing , <person> , is you 've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off .

oh , <person> . we missed you so much . 
trudy and i are goin ' for gina ... 
about his letters -- that 's all she remembered . <person> violent material , i 'd say , obsessive , a quite sick man . but that 's not unusual either . 
okay , <person> ... 
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts ? 
that <person> 's on to him . 
i suppose guinness will suffice . 
... but , with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh , c'mon , c'mon ... they ca n't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as i 'm careful . ... mind you , if ever they could prove i 'd been working on their equipment ... well , that 's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch , sir . 
yeah , but i ... uh -- i thought you needed that . when-when-when we met , you said your life was chaos . 
<person> bertrand ? <person> <person> ? i believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the chamber of commerce . is that the man you had in mind ? 
well cheer , why do n't you ? no more responsibilities , <person> . <person> -- <person> -- me -- all taken care of . down there feeding horses and raising kids , you wo n't have a thing to worry about .

hi . 
she knew you loved her . 
for the first time in my life , i 'm happy . 
that 's good . they 're allowed , but i do n't like 'em ... for obvious reasons . <number> man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo . you would n't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let 's see your <person> 's apartment ... it 's a good <number> . 
i want to see him . 
bela died .

so come up to the lab . 
chase , it 's <person> ! 
yeah . that 's right , <person> . those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them . 
look into the convent records . 
you 're sure <person> <person> wo n't mind ? 
same to you . 
am i getting warm ? 
anything ! just make contact . 
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin ' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow . <person> <person> generally gets me a box of french fried potaters . but i reckon he can lay off doin ' it tomorrow . 
i 'm < u > fired < /u > . i 'm unemployed . is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength ? clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off ! 
<number> question : do they have a sheet on you , where you told him you 're from ? 
understood . keep me informed . 
okay ... <person> , now what . 
i do n't know . <person> . is it ? <person> ? i do n't remember . 
do n't touch me ! i 'm not doing it for you ! 
it < u > is < /u > beautiful . but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques , so i gave it to my secretary . 
frances ? 
you got a better way up ? 
looks like it took out the backup genny too . 
yes , they are . 
here . <person> . this is me and <person> when i was still at city college . 
cut it out , before you break something ! 
exactly ... well , i guess a couple more photos wo n't kill me . 
never mind . wet a towel and wrap it around your head . that 'll muffle the signal . 
i do n't believe it . 
good idea , <person> <person> ! 
i just have time to get the , uh- 
at the hilton . the girls asleep ? 
such as sitting in a darkened room , watching videos , drinking , smoking dope and wanking . does that answer your question ? 
and you 're happy about that ? 
yes , you did . 
ah ! holly now . 
i hope she gets better . 
oh , yeah . it can get real expensive . 
did you get a room ? 
<person> brings me icecream too you know . chocolate ... my favourite . 
<person> 's getting stupid busy . 
matter of fact i did have a kid once . but he 's a lot better off with his father in milwaukee . 
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate , possibly man . in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time - 
what 's to discuss ? 
just give me your hand . 
that 's what we 've got to find out , but <person> went to southern cal . and so did a bunch of nixon men -- 
max . you threw my briefcase in the river . you 've got balls bigger than <person> . 
well , it seems they 've dropped any charge relating to the files . 
if <person> had a chef like <person> , it would change the whole political situation in india . 
b-b-books . you ... you killed <number> men ... singlehanded . 
where 'd you get the gun ? 
no . of course not . just something struck me funny ... 
but you said i should n't call if i wanted to give up on her . 
they have cemeteries . but not like this <number> ... you see , they do n't have any wars . 
i 've never seen a ministry cheque before . 
you said before , that he got boxes ? 
what year ? 
he 's *alive* . he still loves you . so do i . 
who was it ? 
you did n't answer my question . 
still unknown but we 're running prints . kid over there caught the case . 
clam it ! 
i 'm enough of a copper to do my duty . my boss made it tough for me . if i do n't arrest you , i 've gone soft . if i do , it 's to save my face . i do n't play those rules . 
what , is she black now ? 
come on , <person> ! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you did n't care who it was , any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and <person> fucked your way through , looking for a husband ! or the class before that ! 
who was the man in the basement ? 
what are you talking about ? 
i do n't want to place you in any position -- 
frank , you know as well as i do , living in a fish bowl , the insatiable appetite of the media ... 
yeah . i 'm fine . it did n't hurt . 
no . it 's pure bullshit , sweetie . you 're lucky as hell , so you might as well enjoy it . let 's get you a root beer float . 
i 'm not a fool , <person> . 
i 'm in here . 
greatest thing that could happen to you . now you 'll have to sit behind that typewriter . now you 'll have to write .

you 've gone off to america , on your < u > vacation < /u > ... 
perfectly . 
what are you talking -- 
scud . 
no , <person> . you know i would n't break my promise . 
you 're pretty good at arithmetic . 
yeah . i had sex with <person> , and it took him like an hour and a half . 
skip and i would n't have got together if it were n't for you . that 's a big deal . 
i prefered the terrorists . 
asked what they looked like , that 's all . <person> , maybe he 's tough but he sure ai n't no carpenter . 
she could buy and sell you ten times over . 
i want to hear what happened . my brother is a jackass and a damn fool . the both of you have been as scarce as hen 's teeth . 
oh . <person> . 
i do n't know what it is . i dunno , it 's the kind of thing that -- the words wo n't come out . 
the shaft is giving . 
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you ? 
sort of . 
you 're like an undercover guy ! 
i decided to go pro . and who knows where i 'll end up , you know ? 
strong is <person> . <person> is your fate . mind what you have learned ... notice everything , everything ! it can save you . 
i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines . 
we wait for <person> to wake up . 
i 'm happy that you 're working again . as long as it comes naturally , that 's terrific . you 've always liked working with your hands , have n't you ? 
they all sound big at the talking stage . 
you 're saying that <person> is the child , and -- 
you are <number> scary son-of-a-gun . 
do n't know . who is she ? 
me ? grace ? okay -- dear god -- 
oh you did . what did you hear ?

look around , sweetheart . 
well , you know -- there 's the prestige of the job title ... and the benefits package is pretty good ... 
it never solves anything . 
let 's go to the movies ... on you . 
enough ? never . 
they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans , like they do with cigarettes . 
was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers , gypsy violins off stage ? 
decay unfortunately does n't limit itself to the denture , <person> <person> . it spreads into his chest . then the heart goes . we would n't want that , would we ? 
how ’ s the boy doing ? 
we have to be ready . we have to have the money , and we have to know what the information means , and we have to move immediately . 
there was a recipe on the back -- 
you already have . now go on . do it . 
in this crowd ? it 's gon na be <person> , camels , and maybe a few kools . 
what should i be , a white inferior- ist ? a multicultural zulu egalitarian ? let me ask , where are your people from ? 
tell the truth , i was going to take a much needed leak . 
creed 's great , ai n't he ... i 'll do what i can . 
all right - you did n't . 
i 've been better . 
and that 's what you 've heard ? 
you tell me . 
you missed him ? you did n't ... ? 
what i made you do , mama ? 
i do n't know . we 'll find out . 
exactly . people like going to theaters and casinos . but they think church is for <person> -- we could change that . pack the joint . 
we need a warrant . 
yeah , we can have a garage sale . `` hey look , i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents ! '' 
what 's your cut ? how much ? 
threepio , tell them if they do n't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic . 
do n't threaten me , <person> . 
be very careful with <person> <person> . dr. chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him . do not deviate from them , for any reason . you tell him nothing personal , starling . believe me , you do n't want <person> <person> inside your head ... just do your job , but never forget what he is . 
why do n't you shut up now . 
that 's some accident , hombre . you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard . 
but we can not be killed . 
yeah , french guys from france . 
hey , okay . 
none .

does n't matter if he 's hot . just cover the fucker up . 
fifty-seven , fifty-eight -- 
you noticed ... 
but what about your research -- ? 
well , he 's holding on to his shit like it was money .

a piece of advice , mr . bond : do n't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it 's deadlier than uranium . 
then what ? that 's it . that 's all i got . 
you found out about <person> <person> going to texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on . you 're a goddamn spy . 
maybe . 
how much do you make a week , <person> ? 
just a little way . 
there 's over eighty thousand here . 
what do you expect ? you 're dead . 
i did n't give him anything . you were the big-hearted gal . how about wiring your father now ?

it 's all right . stay ready . they know it 's there . 
well , it ai n't that good up there neither . <person> as well make it here . 'course i ai n't really makin ' it now . 
condition ? 
when is the funeral ... ? i am coming to my mother 's funeral ! ! 
it 's a stakeout suit . it 's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it 's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute . 
maybe so . you ever go back there ? where it happened . 
mr <person> , sir -- 
like i had a choice with that anal-retentive <person> <person> rising my ass at the probation hearing . at least he took an interest . you took off without leaving so much as a post-it .

i 'm sorry , <person> ... he 's ... he did n't make it . 
i feel like i did <number> time when i was small . awful scared and lonesome ... i 'd wandered off - i 've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me . they found me in a church . i was afraid to go in any place else . 
<person> sulu ... take us home ... 
<person> meyers ! 
fame ? thank you , no . <person> is the burial ground of contentment . eat it and go hungry ; count it and go broke ; seek it and grow mad . <person> is what fools yearn for and wise men shun . 
the hinchberger wedding . 
you 've been retained ? 
i only have your word for that .

now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end . that 's right , just <number> more night and the princess would have been his . but she , also , could not have kept her promise . and ... that would have been terrible , he would have died from it . so instead , for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him ... 
sir , with all due respect ... . 
whatever . 
so who are you ? 
you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town . is that right ? far out .

i 'm scared . <number> kids are dead . i want to go to this party . 
my promise .

yeah , i went down on a few guys ... 
extra ordinary , yes . but first , you tell me about the headless horseman . 
well , it has n't happened yet - has it ? 
i know what it is . she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle . inside there 's a silvery ring ... 
we 'll be loaded with <number> pounds of bombs and <number> pounds of fuel . i got another chinese phrase for doolittle . `` mug wump rickshaw mushu pork . '' it means `` who the fuck thought up this shit ? '' 
it will . 
but it wo n't be . not as long as you insist on living in the past ! 
do n't tell me how to fight this fucking war , 'lias , you go crying to fucking brigade on your time . out here you belong to me . now move .

you gave me what ? ! knots ! you gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything ! 
what 's he doing here ? 
i 've been to <person> <person> .

i 'll see you later .

i 'm not anti-establishment . 
no , then . 
wow , i guess you were home ... 
then what do you want to do , <person> ? run ? 
really . 
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure , if he decided to make peace with the emperor , at least at this time . 
i told you -- 
a serum test possibly . 
<person> took it . <person> 's out hunting with <person> <person> .

after the accident at the park , a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b . we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves . and they did . for <number> years i 've fought to keep them safe from human meddling , now i want you to go there and document them .

you 're the strongest woman i ever met . i love you , <person> . 
i wonder how long it takes to get someone you 're stuck on out of your system ? if they 'd only invent some kind of a pump for that -- 
duane 's guys , but he 's got them under control . 
who said that ? gary cooper , <person> <person> , <person> <person> ? huh ? 
dorota , do n't be ridiculous , he 's a pediatrician . 
did they try and fail ? 
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down . 
what do you mean ? 
do n't cut me . come on . 
that is n't very nice . 
your word `` empty '' makes me laugh . is it fortunate , or unfortunate ? if it is fortunate , i congratulate myself . if it is unfortunate , i do not care , for i am not aware of it . 
sure . 
in the shoreland hotel . and our only chaperon was the poor old lady 's stomach .

you look like you lost your sheep ... 
lay off , <person> . he 's got a sickness . he 's krank .

she has a richebourg ? mon dieu . i have completely underestimated <person> . 
i 'll see you soon -- 
built in <number> for a member of the rockefeller clan . the tile work was imported from spain . a lot of history in these walls ... <person> <person> stayed here ... <person> fished for marlin right off that dock -- 
i called everywhere in <number> states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me . 
my father 's the preacher . 
i suppose i tried . 
i believe the phrase dr. hoag used was `` titanically remote . '' who knows ? maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out . or maybe god really is on my side after all . by the way , i know you do n't get the papers in here . 
what are you talking about ? 
i was the more deceived . 
certainly . senator . 
i 'm not sure . you mind checking right ascension <number> hours , <number> minutes ; declination plus <number> degrees <number> minutes ?

i do n't know , he had a meeting or something . 
of course . how much ? 
naw . you 're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had . nothing hurts , pard , once you got that <number> down . 
you 're joking . 
we all worked together . worthy deeds were accomplished . i liked the labor . my mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman 's heart when i turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands . i like the blood , is that strange ? 
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world . 
did n't much look like you were hanging drapes . 
then something woke you . what ? did you dream ... ? what was it ? 
you 're so young , this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits .

it was quite a page turner . 
yes , my liege . stand by for attack ! ! 
uh-huh . 
there 's nothing ridiculous about it . a kid like you ...

an so it is . 
well , he 's living proof of that , son . living proof . 
just like on tv . 
years , why ? 
but my own kid bro— 
is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both houses -- delayed and delayed -- millions will be without food and shelter until its passage -- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill -- government agencies will be forced to suspend -- ? 
i 've been here since <number> o'clock this morning . why ? 
<person> burned him out too . you could n't have stopped him . 
it took me an hour to clean it up . that was not in my head !

i had to , did n't i . nothing else for it . then just when i 'd finished my <number> years -- my contract -- wallop , i had to bugger off to the states . 
wow . let 's see . so many sins so little time . for starters i was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child . that was so i could collect her <number> <number> dollar estate . i think i killed several women i was having mindless sex with behind her back . 
i respect myself . a man cuss because he has n't got the words to say what 's on his mind . 
in the spring when he melts !

i-work-for-a-covert-vatican-humanitarian- organization . the-cia-made-a-fool-of-me . i-care-for-you ... 
look , i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win . <person> ? i 'm not interested in the scoop anymore . excuse me . 
i was pretty much the same height now as i was then . 
this is n't your concern . it 's over , here and now . 
i love this guy ! 
i know ... .i know . 
really , what kind was it a mair or guilding ? 
not the point . 
let 's be honest . have we anything like it in russia ? 
you do n't mean it . it 's just for show . 
it 's not just cactus . there 's the nopals , the yuccas -- 
it 's <person> . 
mother ! did you hear me ? ! <person> murdered <person> in the mensroom ! i saw his dead body ! 
and it killed bo ? 
sure , mack ... 
the sea and i do n't agree with each other . where we off to ? 
do me a personal favor -- 
our abstinence makes our love immortal . if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago , now i should love you even more . but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires . 
mom 's going to hate it . 
she 's still alive ? 
<person> kramer , nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus . 
norstars . 
victoria .

what 's his line ? 
<number> , shit ! 
what ? ! fuck off . save yourself . 
well , his body was found monday night , okay ? but , get this ... the office was closed all day monday . <person> means , as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend , our killer could 've gotten in here on friday . he could 've spent all day saturday with <person> , and all day sunday . 
i really do n't think i need any social advice from you right now . 
why did he do that , reckon . 
in your dreams . 
i do n't understand . 
as usual , i do n't have anything to do . 
i 'm glad you did . 
eh , no . 
a tab . 
spock ! my only concern is getting the ship back . when that 's done and <person> is in here then you can debate <person> <person> <person> until you 're green in the face . until then , you 're either with me or you 're not . 
the obvious . but we are both not interested in that right now . 
because he took a contract on you . he 'll come for you and he 'll find you . 
point is-i 'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably . 
yeah , i know it 's small . 
vasquez , take point . let 's move . 
i missed you at the funeral home . <person> said you were here . 
hardly . who 's the girl ?

what 're you gon na do , put me in a bag and bury me ? 
what are you gon na become , <person> ? queen of the rodents ?

and you have n't made an ounce of progress . 
you remember <person> <person> ? -- we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high . 
major . 
not till i 'm dead , <person> . 
you think i 'm shitting you ... 
that 's so long ago , i do n't remember . 
-- a living , breathing actor -- i ca n't work with a fake . 
she 's stunted , that 's <number> thing . 
fair enough . 
trip , it 's not the end of the world , okay ? quit acting all squeezed out . 
this should be the heaviest shower of the year . 
acquired ? 
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector . any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction . 
no one knows . he bought the election a few years back . he 's been rulin ' <person> ever since . 
he 's right . do you have any idea what <person> <person> 's `` vase with twelve sunflowers '' is worth ?

heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them ! 
i would never -- 
no , i 'm not . why do you think she does all this ? it 's <number> of the many ways she can put herself on display . when you bait the trap , the mouse will snap . to tell you the truth , if it was n't for the fact that <number> <number> thousand lire represents my whole month 's salary , well ... but you had something you wanted to ask me ? 
thank you for being rational . 
we 've done it before . 
<person> levine the shmuck ? 
really ? hell , if having a screwy family made you crazy , the world 'd be <number> colossal nuthouse . 
i heard something like that 
every night i cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again . 
fine . 
and is that the most horrible thing in the world ? 
it 's just that you get me so mad sometimes ... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about- 
you know ... i like you . 
<person> told you - i 'd give up my own life , every minute , every hour of it to take back <number> of your tears baby ... my children my best thing . you my best thing ! 
we 'll lower it out of the window with pulleys . <person> stallin ' .

i ca n't . i 've got a kid . she lives with my parents . <person> knows where they live . 
and you 're looking for ? 
the writer . 
someone names a lot of warts on line <number> . 
too bad we all ca n't , baby ... <number> thing about <person> ? 
you did n't ask me to meet you <number> miles from my office for a bible study class . 
i 've done that before . 
well , maybe they 're not . 
why is that ? 
... <person> . 
we should n't buy a single slice , spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there . 
he looks after me . he 's a gentleman too . 
fill in the blank : `` i blank <person> <person> . '' 
me ? i say you do n't have enough brains to be stupid . 
where is your luggage ? 
i do n't know , he 's got an awful lot on his mind right now . 
the world needs dreamers . to relieve the pain of consciousness . 
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ? 
oh , you 'll help him now , <person> , wo n't you ? you 'll see that he gets out ? then he 'll have his work , all that he 's been living for . 
people just do n't take the name heather seriously . they should , should n't they ? 
that is correct . 
you 're not a woman . 
i never trust a woman who 's not blonde . except for my friend <person> , but that 's only because she 's a blonde at heart . that 's the whole reason i 'm starting the blonde legal defense fund . 
what makes you say that ? 
so what are you saying ? 
it 's too soon even to - < u > talk < /u > about that ! 
you do n't respect me terribly much either , do you ? 
this is really weird and really embarrassing for me but ... .uh ... . i was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money . 
my plan is on his way to <person> right now . that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us , but we ca n't seem to do nothing for ourselves . do n't you feel a little disgusted right now ? 
<person> guess what ? we 're going to the carnival tonight , be ready to go in <number> minutes . 
but i 'll get my normal fee , right ? 
yes . 
you think i 'm like that ? 
where does it make berth ? 
you do n't have to defend him to me , <person> -- i 've been called names myself .

suits , underwear , <number> <number> dollars ... the usual stuff . travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device . <person> into my office . 
attempted murder . 
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man . 
no , man , nothing is fucked here -- 
who 's conducting ? 
well ... for a start ... er ... there 's no killing ... 
welcome to hard times , <person> .

all right . kisses to you . 
yeah . why ? 
i 'm not making it any worse . you are . me and <person> could 've worked this thing out . it 's normal , it 's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it . believe it or not . how do you think this makes me look , treating her like some tragic victim or something ? 
is there some kind of expression i 've picked up from <person> ? ! some kind of fairy attitude i 've unconsciously adopted ? ! am i walking different ? ! some kind of vocal thing ? ! have i picked up some kind of homo < u > vibe < /u > ? ! 
good . i 'll give him an extra <number> grand for his trouble . i hate that motherfucking house and -- 
what is your name ? 
that 's too bad . i would rather have him at home -- to see what i 'm going to do . 
everybody makes their own fun . f'you do n't make it yourself , it ai n't fun , it 's entertainment . 
all right ? that 's wonderful ! it 's the majestic -- <number> street . 
hello ! 
lissen . i do n't care nothin ' about you , but if you mess in this , your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble , an ' <person> get sent back to the penitentiary .

we want a sense of your overall capabilities , limitations , turn-ons , turn-offs ... 
<person> 's mom had this newspaper . it said you killed the guy in minnesota and were in a mental hospital . is it true ? 
<person> . <person> . <person> ? 
no , <person> ... i 'm afraid it 's phase <number> for you ... 
i guess so . like you said . it 's a strange world . 
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want , we 'd agree , would n't we ? 
thank you for seeing me . i hear your wedding day is near . you must be overwhelmed by the preparations . 
damn right . 
number <number> .

it 's already been negotiated . it 's done . the money is there waiting . 
the video of <person> and tamina - i told you to erase it . 
the pta is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school 's curriculum . 
if there 's anything we can do for you , dr. mimms . we want to help . 
did you stop to talk to anyone , <person> ? do you enjoy that ? 
so <person> , when were you going to tell me about the <number> <number> dollars we got in from san francisco <number> days after i got arrested ? 
the government knows . i can not repeat it to you . but this thing goes deep , <person> . this was not your wife . i goes deep , and involves the government . there is a great deal of fear . you know how certain circles would find it -- the knowledge -- a threat . they try to limit it , and -- 
french or american ? 
what did <person> <person> say ? 
if i could just see some identification . 
we were neighbors for a couple for weeks on <person> <person> . 
i wo n't be back . i 've requested the atlanta run . 
it is , it is ! hie hence , be gone , away . o , now be gone . more light and light it grows . 
in <number> goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ? you coulda been nailed .

very good idea , <person> . in fact -- -- i 'd like you to handle this operation personally . 
well forgive me if i do n't think of you as the world 's safest bet . 
well , that 's very reasonable . howe i hate to bring it up , but she 's got an awful toothache , we 've got to carry her to the dentist . 
what do you mean , like physically ? 
do n't be ridiculous , these are my babies . 
but will they ? 
i do n't think he wants me to find him . 
naturally . but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a ... dispute over a point of geography . 
i got ta be honest about something . 
could i ? 
i 'm sorry -- 
no , that 's not <person> <person> . 
the kid ran into something mean , and it was n't the cold . 
the church ! 
well . he does n't think it 's god , but for different reasons than me . he 's thinking : if i can figure out how to make it stop , than i am smarter than it is , and therefore it can not be god . 
they 're holding position . 
the only thing remarkable is who you made it to . 
why are you doing this ? 
<person> -- 
gosh , in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them , 
what 's wrong with how i carry myself . 
very well , thank you . i 'm with the county family services department . eve tells me you 've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life . 
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information , so on . 
thank you . 
the knife . what knife ? 
to begin with , she 's only sixteen years-old . 
dietician ! this interview is over . you can have the camera back tomorrow . come by the classroom . <person> heads off . 
<person> day . going to close with <person> <person> -- look at you , <person> , all cool as a cat and over at bontecou 's , i 'll bet he 's shitting in his pants . 
you want that ? 
sure . i remember . . . <person> , did your ears pop coming up in the elevator ? <person> did . 
oh , i would love that , <person> . 
no . < <person> > knots < /u > ! 
hi , <person> . 
will he show mercy to my country ? will he take back his soldiers , and let us rule ourselves ? 
your surprise , chet . her name is lil . 
what 'd you think ? 
i 'll do my best . 
guess i 'm not a single type guy . 
you < i > are < /i > a catch . no doubt she 's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring . everybody wants to `` breed up '' . what 's wrong with her ? 
i 'm tired , <person> . so tired . i have to rest a while . 
<person> -- but i 'm on a vacation -- 
it 's them , <person> . now , <person> , listen to me and listen to me carefully . listen to me as you never listened before . 
is it ? i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things . 
thanks . 
well , i dunno . i mean , when you looked at all the other options ... it just seemed sorta obvious . 
we 're gon na get there first . 
what would you think , in the middle of the night ? i mean , <number> what , <number> bears ? he 'll call the police . 
as the same time , i would n't want birds that were aloof , either . 
yeah , i 'm a good man . something make you think i 'm not ? 
oh hi , <person> . 
yes , sir . 
so ? 
your homie , <person> . only thing , he went to the men 's about a while ago and never came back . 
how ? 
all right . you 're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes , hats , automobiles , radio , furniture , everything . they 're all nice , lovable people , and they let you alone . is that right ? 
`` most smartest ? '' oh , that 's good , <person> . <person> sure you get a picture of that . `` most smartest . '' we 're cuttin you off and sendin ' you home . 
i 've always seen that . 
i have . 
say fuck . 
that 's great . i was afraid i 'd have to go to sleep . 
but i like to ... and i do n't smoke that much . 
how about , he sees her on the street , he wipes the soot from his eyes . he goes up to her . `` what happened to the horse ? '' she looks at him . she takes his hand ... 
no -- he 's probably <number> of the `` here 's how . '' take it easy -- the ocean 's pretty rough today -- 
fats , look , i got about <number> hundred dollars here . you ca n't run out on me . 
i 'm hysterical . i 'm having hysterics . i 'm hysterical . i ca n't stop . when i get like this , i ca n't stop . i 'm hysterical . 
always on my ass , anyway . 
i 'm just being realistic . 
who is ... we ? 
i do n't know . i must have lost my punch . i did n't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up . 
yes . but first of all we 'll have a little talk . 
my dad liked you . and <person> never told him we 'd split , because he was n't up to it and ... oh , i do n't know . i do n't really understand it . i think she thinks he 'll be able to see what 's going on . it 's like ... he 's been through so much , what with dying and everything , that she does n't want to upset him any more than she has to . 
just tell me when you 'll have it fixed . 
oh yeah ? 
you 're makin ' a big fuckin ' spectacle of yourself . 
yeah , well . you know , <person> 's pretty eager to get up to ... you know , but , uh , yeah . we 'll see how it goes . 
guys , guys ! come on , if this is anyone 's fault , it 's mine . i was the one who grabbed <person> 's jacket by mistake . it 's my fault and i apologize . 
since today . new policy . 
that 's the idea . 
i think i 've got it . once i get going , i 'll be okay . but ... how do i get started ? i mean , i hardly know her . 
well , if the blood got < u > onto < /u > the gaff by crushing a man 's skull ... 
well , not until now -- for <person> 's sake . 
wait . he left . 
bad ? 
anyway , i 've always said , the work is the thing . i can be happy without a marriage , but take away my work , that 's different . and if <person> ca n't handle that , that 's her problem , like we re all alone in this world , you know what i 'm saying ? i mean , fuck . <person> , what 's takin ' this guy ? 
no , well go if you want to , but do n't talk to the police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he 's got a temper -- he could 've hit <person> . <person> luck , <person> . i 'll catch up with you later . 
... flying gracefully ... over the rice fields . 
you mean you 're ready to give up ? 
no . you 've had your chance . 
what 'd your father do ? 
but why does n't it matter that we 're not the same people we used to be ? 
from glades to the turnpike . then i left with <person> . 
maybe milking . 
every variable but yourself . you do n't eat , sleep . you ca n't live in your head like -- 
what 's it about ? 
chaz , if it 's an organism , and we let it in , the ship will be infected . 
the senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber . 
<number> ? 
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being . 
to get to mcgruder , you have to go through missoula , and i ai n't goin ' to missoula . 
right . do n't say my name , just listen . somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago . 
-- `` billy-jean '' -- 
yes ! 
get some rest , <person> , and you 'll feel better in the morning . we 'll talk then . 
i know you do - you and your television ... ... good luck , <person> . 
he 's a nice guy . <person> ought to keep in touch with him . 
no , i ca n't leave you . i wo n't . not yet . not until i 've made you laugh ... at least once . 
then what the hell are you talking about ? 
a son , yeah . what about him ? joey . 
we stranded <number> runners in the first <number> innings . this will come back to haunt us . 
you will forgive my curiosity , <person> <person> . the point is , an enemy of the reich has come to <person> and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us . 
but i had to help my friends . 
all i 'm saying is that if you 're unhappy you should leave . 
there is no out of here . you 've been killed . do n't you remember ? 
i thought -— is <person> just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life . no . not my favorite client . she 's going to make an entrance this town will never forget . 
what 's what ? 
agnes ... 
you like me . i like you . i guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone . 
what do you do ? 
you 're not a liar . or you 're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched.. 
what hotel are you staying at ? 
benjamin -- i have n't even said i 'll marry you yet . 
no , no , see dr. grant , you 're the best . you 've seen these animals in the flesh . no one else has come close to you . 
<number> large , in the drawer right over there . i never saw you . 
<person> <person> , lapd . i 'm in charge here . 
you 've been cheating on me have n't you ? 
do n't you understand ? i just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow -- 
on the contrary . it has everything to do with the world . and our dreams of how it will succumb to us . you enjoyed the girl ? 
look , maybe you oughta ' leave . 
when he first came in to the sleep lab ? 
and i 've got a witness ! your <person> <person> saw the crime . 
huh ? oh . <person> . she 's great . 
<number> , you could be right . your sons are alive . all my sons are dead . 
what d'you say , <person> ? tighten her up ? 
<person> , yes -- well -- thank you , sir . 
what i 'm saying . but you still come out this goofball romantic . 
before they kill somebody else , too . 
no , not me , i 've been lucky . but i 've seen what happens to other people -- 
there is no jesse . i 'm <person> now . 
how about the cop ? 
and <person> 's stuff ? 
you kill me , you sign your death warrant . and hers . 
why should n't she be ? 
we do n't have ju-jukes . we do n't have coca-cola . we only got <person> <person> <person> . 
<person> ? 
no , no , no , no , no . keep goin ' . 
perhaps he will listen to you ... 
and whatever you sensed out here ... . 
look , i ai n't saying it was right , but sometimes things happen . 
allah be praised . and what battalions will you call upon ? 
<person> does not hold a driving licence . as for his passport , i do not know where he keeps it . 
not bad , man , not bad . you put things together quick . prague it is . 
look , meet us out front when you 're through . if they try to take anything away from you like <person> <person> up there , just make a list and we 'll have 'em send it down to the boat . 
please ! i want to help you . let me help you . 
do n't get me wrong , <person> . i 'm not suggesting you murdered anybody , you know . 
oh my gosh , here it is ! 
then just wait -- maybe this whoever 's got you next on the asylum 's equipment- test list . maybe a literal mind-blow inside the `` saturation chamber . '' 
what was he like ? 
have you talked to tom about it ? 
i 'm here , are n't i ? 
we 're losing pressure at <number> liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked . in <number> minutes , our atmosphere will be gone . we are fucking dead . 
uh , sure . 
i may not be dr. freud or a mayo brother or <number> of those french upstairs girls - but could i take another crack at it ? 
you do n't have anything < u > for < /u > her either . come on , it 'll be very . the note 'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks . 
i thought you were n't talking to me . 
the letter writer is obsessed with you . his only escape may be ... 
but you have some objections here and there . and maybe right , for all i know . but the point is -- there 's no sense stopping the whole works now -- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through -- 
i did n't . 
your mom must be really glad you 're not taking me . 
<person> city . i 've been meaning to call you for months . 
who are you talking to ? 
you 're full of tricks , are n't you ? 
i do n't really know , but it sounded distinguished , like , did n't it ? 
then i 'll transpose . 
what 's it for ? 
what would a truck stop be without beer ? 
you do n't look anything like a three- year-old . 
how ? did they figure it out after i died ? 
sure i do . i understand he 's in the hospital . how is he ? 
yer crazy ! -- i ai n't got no bracelet . 
i was n't trying -- 
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures . 
if you 'd leave me alone , i 'd be able to get my work done ... . 
a little more so this time . 
you do n't agree with <person> , then ? 
that was the same thing <person> said . 
hold that thought . are we being shot at ? 
maybe you have n't any sense of humor . well , i 'll give you <number> more chance ! now listen ! 
jump ! 
<person> ! do something -- 
catch ? 
maybe if we had them both to dinner or something . 
alright . <number> , <person> . 
i 'm not laughing , <person> . 
why ? what are you going to do ? 
... you saw her ? 
that 's what i call a louse ! if i were you , sugar , i 'd throw that bracelet right back in his face . 
and all the time he 's apologizin ' to the cat , goin ' `` i 'm sorry . '' bang , `` i 'm sorry . '' bang ! 
hey . 
her parents wo n't be going overseas now . . . they 'll have to cancel their trip . do n't worry about juliet . 
told you , i 'm superstitious . 
i ... you 're not going to understand this . 
you do n't get it , do you ? society nods its head at any horror the american teenager can think to bring upon itself . we do n't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting ? 
which is precisely the < u > point < /u > . <person> is over . it 's time for < u > action < /u > . my men could have mass- produced this by now . 
if it 's pretty speeches you want , you wo n't be hearing them . even when i mean 'em , they do n't come easy . 
you do n't know ! 
yeah . 
-- it was all in hundreds , was n't it ? 
wah ... ? where are ... ? 
what 'd you do before this , anyway ? wait -- let me guess . ice sculpture ? rock ? 
are you busting my chops or what ? 
nothing that ca n't be exchanged . 
you do n't have a headache . i have a headache . 
wait a minute , wait a minute . you saw <person> last night ? 
oh yeah . 
i 'm askin ' you , frankie , to keep an eye on nicky . do it for me . 
it 's the only way . 
oh , i know . the people are quite taken with her . it 's odd , but when i hired <person> to have her murdered on our engagement day , i thought that was clever . but it 's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night . <person> <person> is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged . they 'll demand we go to war . 
their next target . the name is <person> . 
your cairn . 
oh . 
so what are you guys doing this summer ? 
can you stand ... back ... maybe , i mean ... just a little bit ... in the room is ok , but back from us a little ... 
i 'm getting better all the time . 
come on , get going , get going ! 
did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room ? 
uh-huh . 
that 'll be the day ... 'as we developed the village ' ... next time you develop a village , hit it where the fightin ' men are ... you wo n't get any headlines for killin ' squaws . 
i ... 
yes , there was . 
yeah , me too . 
<person> then . 
twenty-five ? around there . 
okay ... let 's say that , for now . 
anything ai n't a very hard number . 
why not ? 
do you expect me to believe that ? 
i have trouble sleeping . while i 'm lying in bed i figure them out . the stories . 
i 'm not wrong . she told me so . besides , she would n't have to tell me . i 'd know anyway . i found out a lot of things last night . i 'm not ashamed of it either . it 's probably <number> of the few decent things that 's ever happened in this hellish place . 
or did you steal it from your old friend <person> ? 
sounds great , <person> . 
turn that thing off , will you ? it 's driving me nuts ! what 's <person> ? 
i wrote them down in my diary so that i would n't have to remember . 
let me just explain to you -- we just moved here , y'understand ? the kid has no friends yet and -- 
that 's it . 
they come in any other styles or colors ? 
i needed to see you again . 
holy shit . <person> ... 
now ed , are we cross ? 
right . 
i buy them flowers . 
not now ... please 
you did n't care about my case ? 
you 're nuts . 
no , no , no 
i know . 
maybe you 're going to have to like me . 
do n't believe the hype ! ! 
wait for what ? 
i 'm here for movies . 
you forget yourself , homer . this here 's my daughter ! you got your own mess to deal with -- ai n't that right ? 
no , really , i am sorry , sorry to be ducking out on you like this . i hope you wo n't take it personally . 
i better do this , stan . 
it 's a fucking milligram of sweet'n low ! 
yeah , me too . 
i ca n't comment until i get paid . 
uh , excuse me , sir , but my friend was the <number> balling your wife a couple hours ago , and he seems to have left his wallet behind , and we were wondering ... 
i did not . 
no one 's gon na be looking at my hair . come on , we 're on . 
it must 've been a time . a golden moment . 
you do n't need to know the details of this mission ... you 're better off if you do n't . 
the kids okay ? 
and , if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit , you tell me . 
uh-huh . it was wonderful . 
you ca n't be in here . 
sure , no problem . 
i 'm *not* a doctor . i have n't been to medical school -- i have n't even been to high school ! 
i tell you it does n't exist ! 
uhura , you did what was necessary . keep trying . you 'll find him ... 
yeah , there 's a pair'a broads i 'm thinking might be good for this . 
in a manner of speaking . 
call me <person> . 
no ! please ! <person> up , will you ? we 're trying to think here . it is sort of like being a puppeteer . i like that about it . 
'course i am -- but does n't mean i wo n't leave you here . if you believe anything about me , better be that . 
i did n't ask you to ... . 
yeah ? 
that 's what it says . 
shut up ! ! ! 
yeah , okay . go ahead . 
that 's the way of it , fettes . you bring the lassie to me . 
i bet you 're a damn good poker player . 
i was n't making fun of you . 
a little lift , yeah ... 
well , perfection can get wearing after whi ... 
who 's she ? 
what have you done with his body ? 
the guest list . it has n't been updated since the murder of the president . 
`` king <person> '' . it 's really good . 
how ’ d you know my name ? 
because if you do , i 'll kill you ! 
and the ten <number> ? 
carefully . do n't want to get shot by you . bad karma . <person> , you need me . 
no , he did not ! we are a loving supportive family , <person> <person> . 
what for ? 
i ai n't tired yet . 
and that 's <number> ! 
good fighters . 
a lot of things . all i know is i 'll be back in <number> months . 
like a tea ceremony ? 
i was fired by <person> <person> . i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against <person> <person> and his partners . 
good . <person> . i 'll be in new york with <person> , i can squeeze it in . 
yeah . that fernet tastes like tar . my grandfather tried to give me that . 
yes ... 
come on ! 
the whole world 's a jungle , huh , <person> ? dog eat dog down to the last <number> , right ? 
somebody took it out of commission last night . 
did she water this plant ? it looks a little bent out of shape . 
really ? and what is the kick of it ? because i never ... 
wonderful , wonderful . 
i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that 's where the light comes from . could n't see it with the lanternon . 
i do n't really feel like talking about it . the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place . 
but if it 's him . if he 's really come back , wo n't he know us ? love us ? 
what the hell 's going on ! 
you want to tell me ... 
maybe . i could have stopped it , though . 
i know it -- i know it -- the moment i was rid of him -- 
new praetor ? 
this was last month . so <person> <person> does not have cancer . 
yeah . 
i 've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through . he 's a cop ? 
-- it 's less than <number> feet , just -- 
what 's it going to do , being a plant ? 
i found a room . 
i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria . 
i < u > like < /u > our history . and i like you . i 'd probably like < u > brill < /u > if i ever got to -- 
nothing 's more dangerous , especially for an old man . 
i can handle it ! 
gentlemen , the prosecution rests . 
morning , skipper . 
stop by our spread after that , tell our ma we 're all right . we 'll go to <person> <person> . 
i told you , i 'm fine . it 's < u > you < /u > i 'm worried about . 
that 's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of spam like you . you look at this picture and all you see is beauty . i see the beast . 
they organized this , not me . i have nothing to do with it . 
yes . yes , i can hear you . 
it 'll work . it 'll work . 
c'mon , man , it 's cold , man . 
i mean the nature of you . 
then you admit -- 
uh . how about promoting a bridesmaid ? someone you know for at least forty-five minutes . 
oh , <person> , <person> , i know . why does everything have to be so hard ? 
so i quit . 
you 're catching on . 
<person> , i do n't know where you 've been since you abandoned my daughter <number> years ago , and i do n't care . it was good that you left , and i 'm glad you did . so what do you want to talk about ? you 've grown up a bit . maybe i had you figured wrong . 
they did , but too fast for you to see them . no magic , just grace and speed . 
i had to . i was frantic . i did n't know what to do . 
evidence of a massive infection . 
oh , shit . <person> . <person> , come up here ! 
i 'd know it , <person> . i 'd know . for <person> 's sakes , what are you trying to do to me ? i love you . 
yeah . i 'm surprised . it 's really old ... <person> well though . you know , the world looks a lot better from up here . 
why not ? 
uh-huh . 
no . 
if we make a mistake. , he 'll burn us . you make a deal , you 're always better keeping your end up . 
mmmmmmmph . 
it 's really long left slide , breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell . 
it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas . 
i told you . 
you 're a fat hypocrite . you do n't feel any sorrier for <person> than i do . 
on what ? 
he has to . that 's predestination . if <person> is omniscient , if he knows everything -- and he would n't be god if he did n't -- then he must have known , even before the creation of the world , the names of those who would be saved . 
what do you mean ? 
no , but we can . we can do it together . <person> and guts , chief . 
you 're right , <person> <person> , and maybe i jumped the gun . 
you . 
<person> apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles . work better for you ? 
we 'll skip the court martial this time ... <person> out . 
yes , i presumed it was about him . 
i never notice the view after the first week . 
nothing . 
this is private property , my friend . 
wait , i want to say good-bye . 
dead . 
< b > thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything i 'd ever hoped for- < /b > 
oh . right . 
no coke tonight . <person> ? 
if i could see what you 've seen , feel what you 've felt i would n't let it end like this ! you need a like to the world out there , a connection ... then it wo n't end like this ... 
maybe a brandy . 
so i see . 
i looked all over for you last night , you know that ? 
just tell me . 
what a terrible misunderstanding . of course , <person> <person> can stay in the flat . who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal ... when they pay such low rent . 
i 'm sorry , frank . all that talk about family . i just got emotional . 
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- 
women in london must have learned to not breathe . 
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way ... 
<person> to believe . you shoot up <number> little town in oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun ... <number> little dogpatch town ... and everybody figures your wrapper 's broken . no sense of humor . what did you expect ? an engraved plague from the chamber of commerce ? 
listen , <person> , you better double my attorney 's fee . she 's very inexperienced , but she done a great job for me . and give her your autograph . she thinks you 're some kinda holy man . 
the vampire god . this speaks of his return . 
yeah . 
i 'll show you . 
that 's okay , <person> . i 'm more comfortable in here . it is <person> , is n't it ? 
oh , that has nothing to do with it . 
do n't be sorry for me . i did those things . no one else did . i 'm dealing with that . 
why do you think you tell me , <person> ? 
i guess he 's still on the road . what kind of show is this ? are they some negroes in it without being buffoons ? 
lubbock ? 
he wo n't complain . he can pay off some of his creditors . 
... shit ! it 's just money . 
would you have the discretion to end it right then and there ? 
i always find it surprising , <person> <person> , to find men like yourself , who are working so intimately with the president , yet manage to remain relatively unknown . 
she smiled , baby . 
i 'm going ... i am ... i 'm going to be sick . 
all right , son . 
no ... but ... 
i do n't want you to be sorry , <person> , i want you to be excited . i want my gift to be the first <number> you open this year . you know why ? 
oh . 
how unhappy he 's going to be -- alone in his room . 
you 're telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot ? 
yes . go ahead . 
i came from the city on the left . 
i just love mechanical things . 
really . do you think it 's wrong ? 
you scots have a way with game . it still has life in it . <person> . back home the food is so ... domestic . 
bring the car round back . i know a place upstate they 'll never find him . 
kim-lo ? 
they are . 
i do n't ... . 
how 'd you make your guest list , price : throw darts at a phone book ? 
seymour ? you got ta be kidding me ! 
early ? is <number> in the morning early for you ? 
i did n't say that i would run ... i just ... 
come on . yeah . you know what ? you know , i like you , i really mean it . i really do like you . 
you must get a lot of overdoses . i bet you picked me up a couple of times . 
dad , no . but i did n't want any problems , so i decided not to sleep with him . 
what are you after , <person> ? you want to fry me ? you want my desk ? is that it ? 
what ? you think she 's gon na tell her pit-boss on us ? 
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here ? 
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with <person> about <number> years ago . 
the day will come when you will be free . go to bed , little father . we want to be alone . 
oh , you did ! well , that 's very , very interesting . this happens to be the gun that <person> <person> shot his way out with ! 
no . i saw it on his face . 
tavis , thank you for having me . 
yes , i do . whatever 's out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier . 
<person> stewart . 
off a girl 's wrist . a suspect ... 
i think i 'll just hang out here . <person> sure the sun comes up and everything . 
and is that what you 're going to do ? is that what you 're going to do ... ? 
but i do n't know , <person> . i never heard of sol . i 'd just get in trouble . that 's why we should n't go see about <person> <person> ... it 's better not to get in trouble . 
well ... i just kept wiping that dish . maybe it does n't sound very sexy but it was . 
what is wrong with me ? 
my name ai n't <person> . it 's <person> , like in attica . 
that sounds fun . 
<person> ! 
sure ... you know how to hotwire a car ? 
pour it in . 
yes . you look very sick . 
from what ? what 's with all the security ? 
[ the ransom money . at the drop . he said <person> , <number> of the policemen had taken it . he was crazy . ] 
you did n't hear me . you were sleeping . 
no -- why ? -- should i ? 
okay , <person> , <number> seconds . <number> ... <number> ... 
i hope everything is settled . 
we would like <person> to have a brother ... you know , to play with . 
yes . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
victim my ass ! you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage ! maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved ! 
no . no ! it ai n't you . they 're inside . inside the perimeter . they 're in here . 
oh ? 
he has not been home since that day . but she told me where to find him . 
maybe it 's not going to be so easy . from what i 've heard , mrs. teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t. firefly . 
but i think we should talk about it . or are you fully convinced that we too wo n't understand each other ? 
i am -- i 'm <person> <person> . <person> . this is chief warrant officer phillips -- it 's his boat . we were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold . 
good thing you have a voice-over career . 
i can think of worse ways to go -- 
good-looking ? 
if you 're talkin ' about that crazy murder charge ... 
who 's it from ? 
it gets me through the day . 
are you nuts or something ? what the hell is that going to do ? 
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps . 
so you see , this post is very important to me right now . 
<person> gordon . 
all right . let 's get on it . what 'll you need ? 
i am big . it 's the pictures that got small . 
no , really , i can cope . i can handle this lot easily ! 
they 're true ! everything i said ! witholding that veto was treason ! 
i ca n't talk right now . we have some things to take care of . 
i think you got a good shot at beating the case . 
come on , baby ! <person> 's going to buy you a hunk of cheese ! 
if they 're still alive ... 
so , while we 're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty `` stinky '' - in the long run , we 're going to grow strong from this . 
do you study at all ? 
no . do n't be silly . it 's just ... 
shut your ass up and grab the wall ! 
liar . 
do n't worry i can run every ballet note for note in my brain ... 
what did he say ? 
i know , like <number> chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid . 
what 's the difference if i 'm on call here or deployed in the field . 
maybe we 'll come by tomorrow , help you clear up or something . 
oh , do n't worry about that ... tell me ... does n't <person> own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains ? 
are you sure ? 
no , he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home . <person> ' lights and everything ! 
he 's got a good lawyer , and he made a smart move . we 've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved `` good will '' by turning himself in . 
no ... okay . what i do is watch and wait for , um ... you ever watch someone who does n't know you 're watching ... an old woman on a bus , kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it 's in respond to a private thought they just had ? they are just sort of realer and more alive . and when you notice it so are you . if you look at someone long enough , you discover their humanity . 
oh -- good evening , <person> . 
how long have you been back ? 
shutup ! -- after all ! you have n't talked to me for a week and now i 'm going to say my piece . i 've got a prediction for you , norville barnes : i predict that since you 've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad , you 're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you . you 're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that would n't give you the time of day if you ... if you ... 
that 's not fair . 
yes i am . 
-you 'll have to deal with it , nigel . 
<person> ... please ... 
with him . <person> <person> . 
why do n't you use the phone downstairs ? 
second you get something on those teeth , i want it 
i 'll take my chances . 
where 'd you find the perfect white shirt ? 
you 're hung up again . 
that 's where we came out . 
night , lainey . 
whaddaya mean ! what did *i* have to do with it ? i do n't blame the guy . wow ! twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights ! and things are n't bad enough -- last night i have to get a run-around from some wise dame -- 
you ca n't take anything seriously . 
i ca n't . i ca n't . 
how do you know that ? 
xxxxxx 
keep going ! keep going ! 
<number> , <number> <number> dead . 
yeah , what for ? 
i give you that <number> ... nice packing . 
oh , yeah . <person> , how long do they keep you in this disease hole ? 
do n't give me that ! i was on the bridge . 
we did the decent thing . 
shermin ! ! shermin ! ! ! 
<person> was not bad . 
tapert . so , now i 've got <person> , butterfield . 
that 's what 's used to redeem the mileage , so in noticing the pudding , each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words : <number> dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is <number> miles . add in the coupon : it 's <number> thousand . you see ? 
i 'd be helpless and useless . they do n't have the pem . without that ... there 's no chance . 
margot ! 
just got a reading ... 
you ? no can do . it 's all set . just a few of <person> 's closest friends . 
can you follow simple directions ? 
yeah . 
why ? 
skynet . a computer defense system built for sac-norad by <person> <person> . a modified series <number> . 
the judgment is ours ! 
he 's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight . then , <person> willing , we 'll try to bring him back . 
is that so ? you might marry me ? 
got ta go . 
they got a cuban band that 's the berries . why do n't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn ? 
now , <person> <person> , when last in amarillo , where did you get gas ? 
we do n't think that 's necessarily bad . at least it 's a point of contact . 
yeah , good ! something to keep them busy . we need a decoy . 
yeah ? so ? is that my problem ? 
i 'm going to marry <person> <person> . 
my gift to you . 
i did n't know who i could trust . 
we 're not sure ... 
i 'm dealing with it , <person> . big time . maybe i 'll make you a tape tomorrow . <person> . 
i 'm sorry , i do n't follow . what was there to see ? 
that is very probable . what 's your reasoning ? 
come on ... let 's find you something to wear . 
i do n't ... what if i made a mistake ? 
investigator ... 
i just hate seeing you so stuck . 
you picked her up on the ferry . 
this calls for a joint . you want to do the honors ? 
sit . 
i 'll wear it for you . and i can wear it when we go home . we wo n't be here forever . 
you hear about your old friend , <person> ? 
would'a chopped my arm off if you asked . and this how you do me ! 
i wonder sometimes . 
i 'm with the american federation of variety artists ... 
<person> <person> 's a dirty cop , <person> ! we are nothing like <person> <person> . we did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch <person> paid for what he did . and every bastard like him . we say <number> word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they 'll all walk . every last one . and i am < i > not < /i > going to let that happen . no deals . no compromises . no discussions . 
mmmm ... thanks , <person> . 
willie , come on ! 
he 's crashing ... 
no . 
go ! 
who 's in it ? 
yeah , i saw 'em . poor guys . 
i love you too . good night , darling- 
you 're not a permanent part of her life . you 're a distraction . 
quaid and jennifer -- 
how 'bout a glass of water ? 
where 's <person> ? is he alive ? 
why , what 's up ? 
that 's good . that 's real good . <person> <person> getting pictures for the paper . 
keep talking , i 'll find you ! 
where 's your missus ? 
right , miss . 
caesar , what are you going to do ? 
that 's why it 's my fault <person> 's dead . 
that 's the best part of it . they 've appointed <person> here as executive secretary to take his father 's place . 
<person> ran away , away . 
i 'm going to send him a fruit cake every christmas . 
where ? 
protein digestion is very costly in water usage . 
you vouch for him ? 
i was hoping you had some news -- 
what makes you think i could ? 
oh , i 'm sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i mus n't do ! 
i understand you just got engaged . maybe that 's where we should start . 
really ? 
where do you hail from , <person> ? 
huh ? 
what - tails ? why , that 's a monkey suit ! [ <number> ] do you want people to laugh at me ? i never wore <number> of those things in my life . 
there 's no reason to say that . everyone knows you 're going to be well . i had <person> groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light . 
so 's the job . 
okay , i 'm nuts . 
i never knew that . 
no , i wo n't go with you 
oh . <person> . 
i wo n't and nothing you say- 
-- what ... are ... you ... going ... to -- 
yes . they pick fruit , all kinds . they travel up and down the coast with the seasons . the trick to <person> <person> is , you have to let him be the boss . 
i 'm sure that we 're insured , <person> ... 
who said that ? 
yeah ... threw my whole day off . 
me ? no . well , in the accident i was injured , but ... 
i was ... i was trying to open this tin . 
<person> 's phone . her office line and the line at my house . 
what is ? 
forget the fee . if i find butterfield , maybe we 'll talk about money . if i do n't ... ... my gamble . either way ... i get to spend some time ... here . 
nope . <person> . 
... what do you have to offer ? 
you want us to be wherever you want us to be , asap , no questions asked . 
how am i going to conduct an interview if i ca n't ask him any questions ? 
no ! you ca n't have the baseball ! you 're not entitled to the fuckin ' baseball ! 
i 'm leaving very early tomorrow , before you wake up . 
... people who do n't mind their own business . 
of course ! that 's exactly what i want . 
who ? 
what ? 
pay the good man . do n't you close soon ? 
well , i do n't know ... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the pankot palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil . 
<person> christ , what the hell are you doing here ? what 's going on ? who 's upstairs ? 
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists . 
goodnight , <person> . 
sure . 
i heard you apologize . why ? you have every right in the world to be mad . 
he agreed it was n't exactly news -- 
harold may have lost touch with his bible , but thou must never lapse . 
is n't he that psycho who 's been spying on my sister ? 
you know boss , i 'd really like to help out but i 've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave -- 
<number> night i will get the perfect photograph . 
what ? 
ok . 
do you know what a singularity is , <person> ? does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is ? it is nothing . <person> and eternal nothing . and if <person> is everything , then i have seen the devil . it 's a liberating experience . 
maybe we could run some tests . kind of a comparison , the old and the new ... 
this is a murder investigation . the public should be happy to co-operate , to get this disease off the streets . 
no , i 'm an actor . 
so when they blew it up , no prob . <person> is punished . 
i do n't know how they got to me . maybe cause i repped him here . the feebees run background checks . on my mama 's breasts , man , that 's all i got . there was n't no conspiracy , <person> . if there were , why the hell did n't <person> <person> prosecute it as attorney general , he was his brother for <person> . how the fuck <number> people could keep a secret like that , i do n't know . it was <person> . he was a nut job . <person> , y'know , hated this country . 
yes , sir . 
yes , sir , commander . this is <person> <person> . everything seems a- okay up here and ready for count-down . 
maybe that 's the problem . i want ... a family , <person> . i want kids . a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid . a real life . maybe that makes me a sellout but i do n't care anymore . it 's what i want . 
and even if it were n't , why fly ? where would it get you ? 
<person> <number> . from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident . you wan na tell me what 's going on ? huh ? 
for the first time today , superman i must tell you that you 're wrong . but how could you know that - oh , well . i guess i could tell you now . y'see , actually ... but this conversation is becoming rather dry , is n't it . 
but <person> president ... 
why d'you think these seats were empty . 
oh , it 's you ! you got a lot of nerve - 
yeah , go ahead . might learn somethin ' . 
you ca n't trust <person> . but you can always trust <person> to be <person> . 
<person> ! they voted me most likely to succeed ! 
jesus . all right , gim me a magazine . i- 'cause i 'm a little tired . you know , you , you joke with-about me , you make fun of me , but i 'm prepared for anything . an emergency , a tidal wave , an earthquake . hey , what is this ? what ? did you go to a rock concert ? 
and i 'm the feet . 
when ? 
<person> durden . 
yeah , i just got a funny feeling . like i 'm not gon na see her again . 
and you no longer play at all ? 
something like that . 
because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings . 
it 's too ... elegant . the degree of economy is extraordinary ; it 's really the next logical step ... even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature . d.n.a . outclasses any computer we can come up with ; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable . 
six-fifty . 
telly is at <person> 's . there 's a bunch of people over there . come on dance . 
i 'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself . 
yes . in an hour or so ... all this ... will be at the bottom of the atlantic . 
oh , we germans must get used to all climates , from russia to the sahara . but perhaps you were not referring to the weather . 
in every way . 
it 's the jedi 's time to eat , too . 
throw me out - because i 'm beginning to get goofy ideas , and they concern you , <person> . 
i just could never say it ! 
need any help ? 
so could you get us into the principal 's office ? 
if you 're b.l . <person> , <number> recon group , we 'd like you to come with us . 
behind <person> 's house . 
you think i 'm pushy now , wait 'til i get you on the stand ... 
if necessary . 
yes , i considered it . 
well , i do n't mean to get up on my high horse , but why should n't we look at ourselves up there ? who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and <person> <person> and – and – and who killed <person> grinch-gibbons ? 
... and is that serious ? 
no . i saw a guitar . this is n't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay , is it ? there was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird . in blood . 
really ? that 's swell . no , i was just -- you 're way ahead of me ! great ! 
out directing the search for the traitors . 
oh ... i got something for that . 
please . <person> attack . that was easy street . 
yes , he might be . 
thanks . no , i can handle it . <person> ... there wo n't be enough to run the heaters . in a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker . 
right . <number> o.j . coming up . 
even so , i 'm sure you could arrange an introduction . 
if you like . 
well , waddaya say , you wan na ask them ? i 'll take the <number> inna green dress . 
what would make you think that ? 
do i get to hit you after you tell me ? 
are you sure ? 
i 'll pay you another visit , with a share of the profits , once its sold . 
<person> was a piece of shit . 
vivian , may i point out <number> more nights at <number> hundred a night is only <number> . 
i do n't know ... my computer ... 
mccaffrey , hold this for us . 
why you left . 
yeah —- sure . 
<person> o'higgins , we are in your debt , and rest assured , sir , you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin . <person> <person> , i wonder if i know your good father ? 
yeah ? then what ? 
how long can you keep <person> out without him getting suspicious ? 
i 've got it blocked . i 'm all right . 
have a good day , gentlemen . 
i never mentioned the word before . in his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table . 
oh , i 'll `` get it . '' i 'll `` get it '' all right . i might even take seconds . 
probably the caffeine . 
for what ? 
i 've got a girlfriend , remember ? 
believe it or not . it 's best for you to pretend that you do . after all , it was you who ordered this specimen , received it here , and paid for it . that makes you a party to murder . 
well , what makes you think i have n't ? 
a customer ? does this <person> 's cater to misfits ? 
<number> , this is about reporting , not accessorizing . 
wait here . 
in the darkest moments , it 's what i live for . <person> since i 've heard how much you like to watch ... on the hidden camera . 
really ? what was it like ? a down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ? 
you 'd think so . 
did i forget something ? 
do you mind if i sit down ? what about the blue <number> ? 
do what ? 
was <person> <person> ever bad ? did you ever spank him ? 
the plot . <person> , we must be going ... 
that 's not who i admire -- i admire people who are good at what they do , great artists , writers , thinkers ... 
what is it , <person> ? 
i ca n't . 
he is ... you sat in that coffee shop across from school -- 
you 're impressed with her , are n't you ? 
so tell me about the times article . 
hold your pantyhose . here , gim me a hand . 
good . there . yes ? 
about sixty . 
i have a cold . 
i should fire you more often . the film 's looking wonderful . 
starck ... <person> ... 
oh no , <person> , what did you do ? 
i understand . 
we 'd gone to 'code <person> , ' we were administering electro ... 
what , you 've never seen <number> before ? 
really ? 
give me my book . 
what ? 
tell him i 'm sorry , ok , yes , you do that , now , i 'm sorry , tell him , for all the things i 've done ... i fucked up and i 'm sorry ... . and i 'm gon na turn <person> and <person> now and not look at him not see <person> <person> , <person> <person> , i 'll leave now ... and tell him it 's ok and i 'm ok . the whole thing was ok with me -- and i know . 
very generous of you all . how much ? 
you 're the tom hardy i 've been reading about in the papers , right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from <person> <person> . 
oh god , if only i 'd known . 
not <person> 's uncle but probably the sheriff 's uncle in federal prison . 
i take it you still want the money ... 
meaning these are the people you live amongst , you got a right to know if they 're creeps . for instance , did you know there 's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife ? 
<number> movie . when <person> <person> . 
yeah . 
what ? 
but , the expectation was ten . and , in this case , expectation is everything . 
the day that i ca n't get along without press agents ' handouts , i 'll close up shop , lock , stock and barrel and move to alaska . 
let my daughter go or i 'll take you out ! 
do n't be like that . think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs . 
green . some brown , or , uh , rust , coloration . 
my thumbs hurt . i 've made a mistake . i 've been negligent . i have n't exercised . i have to hitchhike a little bit every day , no matter what . it 's like a musician practicing his scales . when i do n't practice , my timing gets off , my thumbs get stiff and sore . 
i 'll speak to you soon 
jesus , give him a break . there is n't enough proof yet to go public . sure , we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em , and we 've maybe figured out why backdrafts , but you ca n't rush this stuff . not 'till it 's locked . 
i 'd laugh first then i 'd kill them . make sure they heard me laughing . 
i know , sir , but it 's the principle of the thing . 
anywhere ! go ! ..just go -- oh shit ! ! shit ! ! 
frank ... <person> <person> . 
you see the top yardarm , now look to the- 
evildoers , huh ? big or small ? 
oh . i mean , good . 
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to <person> <person> for me . 
i thought artists worked with their subconscious ... .

no , now wait ... think about it . what did you see ... ? 
we have the fibers . do n't you see ? the creature is hungry . it wants the hormones in these plants . it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what 's in these fibers . we 're just a poor substitute . to make it stop hunting , we have to give it what it wants .

disgusting ? bingo night was sold out for <number> months after that ! they raised enough money to build a day care center . 
i 'm glad that 's all over for me .

no need , everything 's under control . 
too many times . 
i 've seen every frame of your work . you 're the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision . you and me , art and science ... we are the perfect marriage . 
that 's who .

well , if all you care about is basketball , why you fucking me ? go fuck <person> <person> .

i do n't care what they 're forming . i 'm on my way and i do n't like the idea of being stopped either . 
i know . 
the people at the restaurant ?

oh , <person> ... 
do n't seem so bad to me . 
my lover and i . 
that would be futile , admiral . the probe would neutralize us easily . 
the wandering sportswriter . 
that 's it . when you tell a lie , you hope to get away with it . when someone else does , you want to find them out . a good batsman will spot a googly . a good bowler will hide it . always remember that , son . 
it was a tough call . 
i ca n't believe it ! 
but the jacket ? i mean ... should we be leaving him in like that ? 
who says that i 'm protecting anyone ? 
<person> <person> saw it with his own eyes . shot him in cold blood . 
<person> 's right . it 'll be fun . 
please . when i came here it was for a little adventure -- a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow . but something has changed me -- and it is n't the champagne . the whole thing is new to me . very new . i 've got a confession to make to you . <person> , you are a crook . you robbed the gentleman in <number> fifty-three , <number> , <number> , and <number> . may i have the salt ?

shit . you better tell me something . 
you do n't know the half of it . 
i certainly do !

i do n't even ... what do you mean ? i do n't even know what that means . 
i was just in the cafeteria , there 's plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .

whether or not you 're willing to play <person> <number> last time . 
i 'm worried too . i 'm worried that the only reason i 'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you were n't asshole enough to get my <number> <number> <number> months ago .

how old are you and your sister ? 
oh , you remember now --

so what i want does n't matter ? 
that 's what we were working on . 
well find some other way ! be creative . tell them she fucks the devil ... hmm , not a bad idea ... why ca n't you say that ? sounds good to me ... and who can prove she does n't ? 
he had a great big bungalow on wheels . i had the upstairs . see where it says 'readers ' department ' ? i remember my walls were covered with black patent leather ...

you are a multi-media magnate . the tycoon of tits . the baron of bottoms .

llewelyn -- 
<person> grove still exists . i looked it up on the net . we should go there and see if there 's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you .

she did n't take my name when we were married . 
t-turned on ? 
julien , what you 're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress . you 're projecting your anger onto us . 
where 's your head , <person> <person> ? where do you think the pressure 's coming from ? <person> <person> - or whatever you want to call him - knows where i am right now . he 's got the front burner under ' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up <number> minutes later . <person> was just to deal with you assholes . i got a whole new problem when i post bail .

but i am that 's the killer , honey . 
mrs. christian ... please , will you sit down a moment ? i want you to listen carefully . what you 're talking about is a `` snuff film . '' but , from what i know , snuff films are a kind of ... urban myth . like , red light district folklore . there 's no such thing , i can assure you .

nah - i had a shmuck of an uncle named <person> . <person> . 
that 's low , but this effects me how exactly ? 
not anymore . 
fine . just gon na get the bowl for my thing . 
any trouble , we whip out our treasury department badges -- show them the wire i 'm wearing and read them their rights . theo seizes the krugerands as evidence . naturally they start negotiating . offer to give us up somebody else . and we listen . take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at justice . we pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing . 
in my home ! in the same room where my wife was sleeping ; where my children come in their pajamas , and play with their toys . 
a lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after . i wonder what they 're trying to pull out there ? 
the precogs do n't see what you intend to do , only what you will do . 
-- and as soon as we lose a game , he 'll be back in your arms . 
- - like birds . what happen is , they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - - 
who ? jed ?

fine . i 'm not looking . 
i do n't believe it . you 're a romantic , frank . 
christmas stories ? sure , i know a ton of 'em .

what makes you think so ? 
if you know about the church , why ask such stupid questions ? 
how 'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that ? 
you ca n't . 
yeah , go-cart accident . 
surprise ! surprise ! 
i loved her for how good she made me feel , and i hated her for how good she made me feel . and at that time , i tended to express my feelings non- verbally . i could n't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions . 
just come to the mudd club on friday . 
yes , so do we . 
you think a woman did that ? ! 
tish-i'm-tee . 
it moved me . i did relate to it -- i really did . it was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice ... but it 's real and it got me ... and i think a lot of the time i 'm too conservative about that kind of stuff . <person> ? 
perfect , <person> . <person> perfect .

i have never seen such a stone . will you please tell me where it came from ? 
must you fight him ? 
please ... please thank the governing committee for me . i will do my utmost to merit their kindness .

where do the air ducts lead ? 
we 're stuck with this ...

from the parapets most likely . the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving . 
emergency procedures .

'thoughts ' ? not a <number> -- but i did hear a voice last night . 
no ! i will not ! this is nuts ! i 'm leaving ! i mean it ... this is nuts . this is too nuts ... i 'm leaving . i mean it !

so you 're just quitting ? just like that ? 
woogie , i caught you red-handed . 
yes . the very killer of <person> <person> <person> 's own master . last night , she killed a policeman who had tracked her down . 
if i do n't answer , he 'll know something 's up . 
you can bring a lawyer if you wish . and you 're privileged under the constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes . 
how do i get out of here ? 
i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ? 
<person> 's address . i sneaked a peek at the rolodex .

bullshit . what 's out there is n't alien . it 's an animal . 
she 's the only one who had a dead man in her room . the only one who wo n't give an account of herself . the only one who tried to run away . and the only <number> , so far , i 've been told , who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes . what more do you want ? 
oh , i 'm not sure of anything anymore . all i know is this should be <person> <person> . but where are the houses ? 
how did you know they were stockings ? 
really ? ca n't wait to meet him . as long as we 're waiting for him , i 'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom . 
well , not your real opinion , naturally . it 'll be written out and you 'll learn it . can he read ? 
oh . 
supervising special agent , <person> . now i want you to go work the drop car , okay , <person> ? okay ? 
no . 
we 're partners here -- 
nice try , kiddo . 
what are you , a theater checker ? you check up on the box office girls . make sure they 're not rippin ' the place off . 
i 'm an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist ! i push things about , but i 've little say what happens to them . 
and if i do n't ? if i do n't you 'll come back after your death . you 'll come back and find yourself hanging there ... wanting to eat ... needing to eat human flesh . you hate that thought , do n't you ? that 's the ultimate sin for most of you fools , is n't it ? 
do n't talk like that . 
we passed it a few blocks back , where the police were . the palazzo gioia . they do n't even know i 'm in rome and i 'm not going to incriminate <person> -- 
you know where she is ? 
i said , do you come here often ! ? 
[ beat ] you do n't believe me , do you ? 
do you remember that summer in france ? <person> , you had jet lag for <number> straight weeks . 
i want you to come . 
mommy needs <number> more minutes in la la land . that could be her present ... 
your shorts are looking especially gold today . 
i would not know . maybe . 
do n't listen to him . ca n't you see he 's trying to turn you against me . 
really ? 
in every practical sense , yes , but , officially , of course , i would have to retain command . 
sweet . 
it 's nothing too hard or anything . i 'm just going to ... look for someone , and ... i want you to be sort of a ... guard . <person> ? 
i 'd ask you to sit down , but you 're not going to anyway . and do n't worry about the vase . 
... < u > might < /u > do the same . i have to warn you 'bout that , chief . i 'm not screwed together like i used to be . 
sounds like a rough <number> . 
what was that , korfin ? 
what the hell is plan-r ? 
huh ! you understand how i feel . how long was it we had , honey ? 
maybe not . but i need you to know . i love you . and i will come back . i 'll find a way . and then we 'll get a chance to know if what i felt the first moment i saw you , and every minute since then , is real . 
every performance ? then - am i safe in assuming you like it ? 
you 'd be surprised . 
<person> haired ... 
because he knows how to get to our man . 
yes , you remember . 
this company 's expanding . they got parks in texas , ohio , california . i think i 'm gon na be going to waco . 
too bad . the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time . 
i was out hiking , camping the past <number> days -- that 's what did it -- < u > i < /u > killed it -- 
that smell . i mean , everybody suffered so much , their sons killed . they need to sacrifice something , y'know , appease the gods of war -- <person> , <person> . i am that blood , general . i am that sacrifice , in the highest place of all ... all leaders must finally be sacrificed . 
this is no good . 
they always seemed what ? they always seemed really great , is what they always seemed . they picked up where your precious <person> left off , and you 're sitting here complaining about no more echo albums . i ca n't believe that you do n't own that record . that 's insane . 
it 's <person> <person> . i work for senator <person> <person> and i was given <person> 's name . 
television or movies ? 
well he was n't <number> of the marx brothers , but he made me laugh . 
it 's the truth . 
you carryin ' a firearm , son ? do n't lie to me now . 
you said you were going to stay . what happened ? 
but it 's not a great syllable 
okay -- 
a long , long , long ... 
which <number> of us is elected to do the deed ? 
you know the answer to that . 
ask your girlfriend . 
i see more than what you are . 
i am not . 
daddy , it 's like i been tellin ' ya -- 
dead ? matter of fact , he 's much better . he 's left the hospital . 
i 've watched you grow up , <person> . 
i do . 
forget it , doll . after all , you work here - i work here - and believe you me , it 's nice to have you with the organization . 
is <person> <person> in ? 
the guy who bought you that ring . 
that 's the original part . 
they think i have a concussion . 
you think i scam ? 
too many people . come on ! shields ! ! 
you 'll answer my questions ? 
you let <person> escape your whole army . you can not blame me for this . 
what i say is , no . we do n't do partners . 
important ? of course it 's important . the point is we can do something about it . 
what are you , <person> friggin ' kissinger all the sudden ? 
keep your voice down . 
yes ... 
heather , it 's just a movie , a dream , really ... 
okay . 
honey , your father knows the president . 
look , about the layton woman - maybe she 's just trying to help the buttle family . 
forget her <person> , she 's a bitch 
what ? 
heavens no . we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place . 
it does n't matter . i do n't want to stir up any more trouble . i 've been doing it all my life . i 've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine , too . i 'm tired , dad . tired of running around in circles . he 's right , that 's what i 've been doing ever since i can remember . 
then what do they have ? 
what ? 
points at the motel . 
that blip we 're picking up might only be the radio-active particle . the proteus may already be destroyed ... 
do n't bother . 
<person> ! now you 're not making sense . 
sure , sure i am . 
no sir , we do n't state that . we 're countin -- 
connie ... what brings you here ? is everything alright ? 
i 'm not mad . i 'm in a fucking great mood . despite the fact that i 'm trapped in a fat suit i ca n't take off , despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back , despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday ... 
why not ? 
<person> henslowe ? 
what do you think ? 
a statement ? 
yes , i did . that 's why <person> studied it . because it was <person> <person> 's fighting style . 
what went wrong ? 
aw , fuck it . 
how did you know i was here ? 
what girl ? 
you came underground when the world was ending above . and you evolved . some into the morlocks and others -- 
what for ? 
beats me . ask your mom . 
marietta , i was just gon na leave and see if i could pick up their trail . 
we ca n't . we 've managed to get inside the <number> place that 's safe . i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements . if we go outside , we 're risking more lives . you have to accept it , <person> , there 's nothing we can do . the building must be swarming with police by now . it wo n't take long for them to get through the doors . 
what are you complaining about ? here 's your fifty bucks . 
did n't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth ? 
been here long ? 
you know who ? 
he was a bit proud as i recall . 
slowly or quickly ? 
it 's my birthday . i 'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago , and i think i should celebrate having made it this far . 
i do n't have any cream . <person> . 
too bad ! 
and i 've got good news for you , <person> . all your troubles are over . 
yes ! 
i believe the boys got a couple . 
watch it , dear boy . i think it was a hallucination . probably a broomstick , or something . 
yeah , well i turned off the set . i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor . you know what could 've happened ? the dog came in and stepped on it , turned the tv back on . 
<person> worked for you . 
we still have pressure . the radiation count 's steady at <number> millirads an hour . 
hurt me again ? not a chance , do n't worry about it . 
oh no . thank you . come on in . 
how do you want to pay ? 
they 're not nice people . 
oh , <person> . 
the heart of the ocean . <person> , it 's ... it 's overwhelming . 
excuse me , i 'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon . 
why -- no not before thea came —— 
that 's where the mask comes in . 
let me save time- you are the engineer ; you are in charge ; you 're sorry i 'm here . right so far ? good- because i am not an engineer , i do n't want to be in charge , and i 'm sorrier than you are that i 'm here- i hate <person> . so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving , and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave . see any problems ? 
since i was a kid . my mom wanted a girl , so she used to dress me in girlie clothing . it just kinda became a habit . 
what ? 
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin . you see , <person> -- 
i know he was good . 
i do n't know . 
i hate goin ' into town . that 's about as close to town as i like to get . 
i tried to show you something beautiful . something about all of us – 
you ... you mean ... <person> <person> killed him while ... ? 
i thought i saw something . 
well he was a boy , he was my friend ... he was my best friend . when we were kids we were gon na ... move out here and move to the brady bunch . 
i am sorry , but i can not stop myself . i think something is wrong 
you 're walking between the raindrops kid . i expect <person> <person> is choking on his royal chamber pot by now . 
my life is meaningless as long as you 're alive . what am i while you exist ? a shadow ? an enigma ? 
there 's an old saying , `` first customer of the day is always the most trouble ! '' but like i said , i 'm in no mood for it so i 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you wo n't have <number> human reason to give me ... 
that 's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used . 
who said there was a girl for you ? i was talking about a girl for me . do n't you want your aphid beer ? 
who told you that ? 
did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road . 
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses . that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters . 
enjoying yourself ? 
<person> weir . he played the mob guy that turned snitch in `` the cyclone '' . 
judy , i just want you to look nice . and i know what kind of suit would look well on you . 
what is your name ? 
<person> 's dropping . the first blow 'll come from the south . <person> get interesting . 
must be my wife . 
fine . i 'm takin ' amy . 
... what did you want ? 
i 'm sure he is n't . though he 's certainly adept at killing . 
you did ? wow , sorry about that . <person> , <person> 's a little not so bright . he seems to think that you said -- 
`` death and <person> '' ? 
<person> cole ... not only am i a teacher ... but i am also a parent of a middlesex child . therefore , i am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge . 
... manly ? 
what 's the big deal about you bein ' on the street ? 
who ? 
president . 
beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors . 
hell yeah . 
... why ? 
it 's not your fault . 
i think i need my glasses . 
listen ... i 'm a guest here . 
that 's possible . <person> <person> was convinced he 'd met me before . but i 'd never met him . another odd thing . when it rained , he said it was just as someone had promised . 
look , goddamnit , i never asked you for a goddamn thing ! i 've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible . after <person> divorced you , did i ask you for anything ? when i would n't see ya for <number> months to a year at a time , did you ever get your shit about it ? no , it was always `` ok '' , `` no problem '' , `` you 're a busy guy , i understand '' . the whole time you were a drunk , did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit ? no ! everybody else did . i never did . you see , i know that you 're just a bad parent . you 're not really very good at it . but i know you love me . i 'm basically a pretty resourceful guy . if i did n't really need it i would n't ask . and if you say no , do n't worry about it . i 'm gone . no problems . 
even the bedchamber passages ! let none remain ! 
no . 
where are we going , <person> ? are we going home ? 
i know where <person> is for c-c-christ 's sake . 
you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me . 
do you get hysterical in small confined spa ... 
i 'd identify him . 
it was n't exactly a lie . 
let me take a look at that map . 
have you got a minute ? 
i do n't want to take up your time now , but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody . it 's a security level <number> matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you . 
we 'd never make it past the raptors . trust me , i have some experience in this matter . 
they 're amish . 
no , there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind . it 's as if time just ... stopped for <number> years . 
<person> owen . 
well , when you started introducing me as `` the old ball and chain , '' that 's when i left . 
poor child -- i wish i were free tonight -- we could -- 
he 's fine . 
and if possible , i 'd like to marry someone from pasadena . 
we have a warrant . to search your boat . 
i want to now who i 'm talking to . 
oh , <person> , <person> ! 
i 've got to go . 
there are no twos , <person> . 
take it easy , <person> ... it 's all right . now , try to think clearly ... do n't you mean _jason's_ hand ... do n't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed <person> <person> 's throat ? 
okay . hope no one hits on you . 
that ai n't my scene . if that 's somethin ' you into ... 
i 'm not <person> <person> . 
what 's that ? 
hush ! 
oh , here we go ... 
ca n't you ? 
what of it ? 
<number> colors ? neato ! 
she 's dead ? 
oh , i 'm much more than that . 
it 's called pro bono . 
fortunately , they did . 
i was planning on waiting until i got the place cleaned out , but -- like the man says , carpe diem . 
is that right ? think you 're gon na make it with her ? 
now that you understand the situation more clearly , perhaps you 'd like to discuss the matter with the president 
take it or leave it . there 's <number> men coming from the south that 'll be glad to get it . 
oh , now do n't get all jealous , <person> . i got a little something for you , too . 
the users ... you really think they 're still there ? 
it 's the gestapo . they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow . 
dr. wigand , you do understand what could happen , do n't you ? 
to see pap . 
really ? it must be a tremendous hem . 
what would you like to know , sir ? 
mom , they 're in a cage ! 
none of my relatives are chinese communists . speak for yourself . 
for a while . 
all right . what 's been going on ? 
he 's getting middled , too . and <person> 's our partner . what 's good for us is good for him . 
i can back it up . 
you filthy bastard . i should cave your fucking head in . 
nothing . absolutely nothing- 
take 'em . 
yeah , sure . 
look at 'em all . they love it . how in the hell 'd we get ourselves into this ? 
now do n't you go gettin ' nimsy-mimsy . 
you should think of me as <person> <person> 's guardian angel . 
decaffeinated too ? 
i believe so . 
okay . 
i 'm sorry . 
how you 're saying she killed her parents ? did she kill <person> <person> , too ? 
oh . yeah . 
we will not have this kind of language at the dinner table . 
that 's true ... wars are n't won with terrorism , neither wars nor revolutions . <person> is a beginning but afterward , all the people must act ... this is the reason for the strike , and its necessity : to mobilize all algerians , count them and measure their strength ... 
you are right . what can i ... 
except possibly that . 
thank you , sir . 
i do n't know why you 've been keeping me here , but you 're in deep shit -- 
he got it , <person> ! 
i 'm not sure why . it 's just , i 've never been anywhere else ... 
when i was poor , everybody doubted i could make it . when i got rich , everyone said , ` yeah , but he 'll never keep it up . ' now everyone says ` he 's killing himself . ' so i clean up , and then they say ` look . his art 's dead . ' i do n't take drugs , anyway . i 'm healthy now . 
it 's enough now . 
mmm . 
i got ta find <person> . make yourself at home . 
i wish they had never met . 
leave your tongue off of that ! 
he just left . kissed her on the cheek . 
it stings a little . 
where you from with that crazy way of talking ? 
it 's beyond mere physical attraction . 
good . now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions . <person> <person> <person> know what he was doing when he fired that gun ? 
thought it might . it 's off an arrest report you typed <number> years ago . man you wanted samples of everybody . 
you think on it real careful-like , <person> <person> -- y'hear ? 
you could buy yourself some things . <person> , or a nice car ... 
then we shall all zalute <person> von und zu schulz ! about face ! 
not even close . what happened ? 
no . 
just say the words . just like i told you . 
<person> told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning <person> flight . 
sheila ? ! 
just call me <person> . 
hellnno , major . i was just trying to think the thing through . 
just sitting down to supper , jake . <person> to join us ? 
i 'm not lookin ' to get crucified . i 'm lookin ' to stay in <number> piece . 
what do you think his name is ? 
no . 
craig , everyone ca n't be <person> <person> . well , grub worms are waiting . do me a favor ? 
it came my way . <number> a week . 
i will , old boy , tomorrow . our work is done here . just came to say goodbye , and good luck . 
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work . 
mmmmm . 
well , to begin with , i 'm not a natural blonde . 
is that good or bad ? 
why do n't you get to it , buddy ? 
have n't got time , <person> 's angels -- lay it right up the tree line . 
good luck . 
a dog . 
what ? ! 
i ca n't leave the house ? 
then we go after him . 
you alone , or you got confederates ? 
yes . 
you told me so . maybe you 'd get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place . 
naturally , comrade . 
i heard that <number> myself , <person> . <person> , i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska . who 's your friend ? 
i 'm sorry . 
not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar . 
<person> <person> <person> ... 
i can take care of myself . do n't worry . 
but you stuck it out , anyway , all that time . 
we 'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything , <person> will be right outside the door . 
well then , i 'll pray for rain . 
yo , dobree ! 
uh-huh . well , dinner comes in on trays . we 're executives . and we light into this . it is dawn . your <person> is ready . you go over there and introduce it -- 
i 've always known ... i 'll die alone . 
harmless - how ? 
oh , and austin ... 
excellent , athos . you have a keen sense of this man . 
llewelyn moss ? 
swell . thanks very much . good luck , senator . keep your left up . 
yeah . i 'm thinking about <person> 's <person> <person> fixation . you know how <person> was always harping `` immaculate reception ? '' i 've seen that play . a lot of times ... and i have to say this ... <person> was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that 's it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ? 
if i have to tell you again to back off , me an you are gon na go round and round . 
forget it . 
but before ! where did you live before ! ? ! 
goddamn you ! stop calling here ! 
did n't get it . 
look , i 'm not saying you do n't have a daughter . it 's just that she 's not my daughter . 
are you sure you did n't leave the room ... that <number> of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone ? 
'cause when we bought the house it was <person> . this is summer . feed the dogs . 
oh sure , pilgrims , indians , tater tots ; it 's a real party continent . 
be careful . 
so what else is new ? 
rose . <person> <person> <person> . 
the next trip , when i come with all the money , it 'll look like i hand it to the same <number> i did before ... 
why ? 
i 'm still poor . 
you know her ? 
nah , i do n't do that anymore ... 
you have nothing to hide . 
they sent me here , <person> because they said you did n't hold up your end of the arrangement , and i have to transport you back to leavenworth . 
you on the game ? 
call dispatch . double the patrols . i want that area blanketed . 
not now . i do n't have time . 
brilliant . 
nobody 's hearing nothing ! 
right , right . 
guess what i am holding in my hand . you like guessing games ? 
hey , <person> ! 
it 's just a little inlay - it does n't even have to be gold - 
sometimes . 
let me see . 
you 're not much with girls , are you ? 
not to anybody . she sings . 
<person> marsh . 
mapping the fucking pig genome . we 'll call your dad , he 's a neurosurgeon -- 
yeah . <person> and i got into a big , philosophical discussion . he 's really quite well read , considering he 's only been literate for a month now . he 's going to make us famous , <person> . 
med-kit ? 
well -- it was nice while it lasted . thanks for the memories . 
it 's not her mind you need to change . it 's disneyland head in there . 
yeah . 
... right , i got a score to settle for the bro ... 
but i did n't sell cigarettes to any kid ! 
i get it . 
yeah . 
lips still for sale ? 
you certainly are ! she has an awful toothache , look at her jaw , it 's all swollen . 
he did ? 
ridiculous ! 
get out of here ! 
it may sound that way , but i react out of fear . my life has nothing to do with what i like or do n't like . you have n't been listening , have you ? 
an eccentric recluse ? 
i do n't get it . 
pete , i 've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf -- 
well , i do n't know for sure ... he 's a hairdresser . 
do n't worry about it . i 'll stay with the boys . 
i never met the woman . i 'm just taking care of the place until they sell it . 
jack , what could you possibly be thinking ? what about my job ? 
a man ? 
mickey : i 'm supposed to meet somebody at o'rourke 's , i ca n't make it . 
this ai n't the time . 
just the fly in the ointment , hans . the monkey in the wrench , the pain in the ass - 
i hate him too . so i just call him `` mavis . '' or `` sissyboy . '' or `` mavis the sissyboy . '' 
i ca n't read . 
i do n't think so . 
that 's not what 's important . 
i 'll remember that . 
that 's a good fantasy , though . <person> , but good . 
a friend . we were vacationing . <person> wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs , so <person> found a guy who would take them parasailing . they never came back . 
will you tell her i came by ? 
pity . <person> <person> . 
i 'm fine . 
<person> christ lady ... 
i know ... the decision 'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts . there 's only a small float out there , so you should grab it . <person> for a <number> point pop . 
it 's my tooth ! my fucking tooth ! i ca n't even think anymore because of it . 
we just want to check your pack -- 
yeah , you met her ? 
it 's funny , you knew . but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen . maybe that 's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt . 
i 'd like to talk to you about <person> . 
no , <person> , i 've turned it into dad 's office . 
by the way , i saw a wonderful idea for christmas presents at the chemists . <person> tokens . <person> gift tokens . 
no . 
what ? 
someone else can do the deed , it does n't have to be you . maybe <person> too , he 's got a tendency to follow <person> , but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their sergeant 's killers ! we 'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west , all we got ta do is tell the story right . 
apparently my opinion was n't needed . 
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories . 
hi . 
well , i 'll be saying good night . good night , miss . 
talk . 
fuck you <person> . 
i could take a cab on the way home . 
engaged ? as in you 're getting married ? 
you called <number> . except the call was intercepted . 
come on , <person> ... do n't you want to see where he lives ? 
<person> , you know the best way to take care of this whole mess . 
well . i got an audition tomorrow . 
if she was his wife , she should have all the money . that 's only fair . i do n't want a penny of it . 
thought you wanted something fun ... 
you 're the oldest man i know , somerset . 
maybe i 'd better go before i catch something . 
it 's not bad , it 's ok . 
would you like to rest , <person> ? you must be exhausted . 
<number> . 
i got eyes , do n't i ? how my not gon na see something like that ? 
is that clear ? 
some other time . i do n't feel like a party . 
freak luck is a strange thing . 
good . let 's go sailing . 
drink tea -- there 's lots of tea . 
did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness ? that darkness is part of their natural development . 
they help me understand why we fight . 
not if i give you all the cards ... 
sightseeing ... what 're you doing ? 
we hire a lot of moonlighters here . 
i think i just broke my hand . 
`` <number> minutes , '' the television show ? 
but it was alive — it was fast and strong ! 
thank you . 
that 's so you 're still getting some money when you hit <number> . 
that 's not where i am . <person> <person> ? where are you ? 
look , if you can get them to finish it by friday , you and your friends can do the opening performance that night . 
you 're not holding him right ... caz ... 
these kids are being manipulated by the communists . like chambers and hiss . 
september <number> -- how far away is that ? 
you seem like you 're anything but lazy , <person> <person> . 
yes . 
so did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight ? 
you stole this truck . 
going out on the 'aurora . ' 
how do you know ? 
we do make a cute couple , do n't we ? 
when i found you ? 
i take it she read well . 
is she bringing him to the wedding ? 
call the police ? 
all right , granted , it has bad plumbing and bugs , but you-you say that like it 's a negative thing . you know , bugs are-are-uh , entomology is a ... ... rapidly growing field . 
this is an awful nice gun . certainly come in handy when there 's men around who shoot people that are n't lookin ' . 
she is looking for <person> <person> , and assumed he would be here with you . no one seems to know ... 
just a place , i suppose ... who knows ? 
no ! ! ! just meet the guy . that 's all i 'm asking . <person> , i 'll even let you choose your own musical director . you can have that . 
please , thel ... 
no . <number> champagne cocktails , please . 
we only have to shove'em over the moat .

it would n't make any difference in there ... he could be <number> feet away and on fire and she 'd still not see him ! 
we ought to dare to tell each other everything , <person> -- you and i . 
funny . i never did . 
... are you going to say anything to him ? 
well , you have to be reasonable . now they say you 're a troublemaker . that 's no good . use a little psychology . <person> 'em think you 're going along - and get what you want . 
we know there 's got to be something or they would n't be so panicked . 
i got your bail continued .

what do you mean ? you talkin ' about coppin a plea ? 
my god ... 
there ai n't no thing here ! ! no thing ! ! there 's you him and me ! ! got it ! you him and ... 
he ' s confused -- 
how important do you think sex is ?

whaddya mean ? we got dick . 
that 's enough . 
yeah . 
if i promise you there 's really a party with a lot of guys , do you promise you 'll go ? 
he looks different now , burns are less extreme , some of these wounds have closed up -- 
not `` we '' , sidney , you ! 
no . 
i got some fuel comin ' out and , i hope , some automatic rifles . 
can anyone else see him ? 
no . why ? are you seducible ? 
perfectly lovely . you know , this is what we 're defending . everything that 's good and beautiful in the american way of life . oh , there 's some nut peace petitioner over there . let 's go off this way . those crazy commie bastards . i do n't know why we tolerate 'em . parasites . 
plans are for the architects , politicians and so forth . 
things have been going pretty well between us , have n't they ? 
same time . what about you ? 
i heard them morgan . 
it 's that serious , huh ? 
we better call the doctor ... <person> . i 'll say how it happened , part i saw . 
very sporting of you , <person> . 
would he know ? 
what do you mean ? i 'm just doing what we 've always done . 
you sure i 'm not fat ? 
okay , not bartending . why on the water every day ? 
i do n't know about that . 
you think it can go faster than an f- <number> ? 
your contract went out to the bank .

you 'll get over that . 
your mother wo n't be going right away , <person> - 
near <person> <person> . she went for help . 
yeah ?

sinister is what i 'd call it ... ! ours is so much cheerful ! why do n't you come and stay with me ... there 's plenty of room in my suite . 
are you discussing gamebirds now ? all birds are not gamebirds , you know . 
you ... know us ? 
it 's irregular , but ... i just love that strip of yours . i figure i 'll take the `` <person> <person> '' guy instead . 
they do not have your connections . 
why ? are they what 's most important ? 
sure . i 'm sorry . 
about the past year . 
it has no purpose . it 's just beautiful ... does everything have a purpose where you come from ? 
question is why they sat here when the storm moved in . check their stuff while i sniff around . 
why ca n't we just explain it ? 
you 're afraid to risk believing . <person> in them . believe in your self . take a risk . it will humanize you as a person . 
out ? out out ? 
i 'd say about a deuce , deuce and a half . not bad . 
did n't know how he got in there . had a broken leg , turned out . just fluttering all around there . 
'cause i got a lot of wall space there . 
kampai . 
if <person> comes here , he wo n't believe that i am out doing the `` meals on wheels '' . 
i ca n't explain it to you now -- you 'll see when it 's all put together . anyway , we got it a couple of takes ago . let 's move on . 
you wo n't tell him , and even if you did , he 'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the commencement speech at wharton . 
not if they 're where i think they are . 
why do you all keep asking me ? 
better than i 've ever been in my life . 
i do n't know . relationships seem too distracting . i 'd rather concentrate on my studies . 
jesus , <person> , you 're breaking my heart here -- 
what ! ? 
<person> 's first officer . do you really believe he 'll listen ? 
i do n't know ... i mean , i 'll be here , uh , indefinitely . 
why ? 
you ai n't like that no more . 
i 'll have your leg . 
merely comfortable . here 's <person> with our refreshments . can you get the door ? 
your little friend 's real sharp there ... yeah , i do n't like to wear the wig on tv , because with <number> and a half <number> people watching you , you 've got ta be sincere . i just like to wear it when i 'm out slippin ' around bowling alleys an ' things like that . i think it gives me a little more class , do n't you ? 
i 'm sorry but ... 
there are n't any more ! that 's the whole barrel . 
that 's nice . 
<person> <person> did n't own a dog .

nine-thirty , ten maybe . 
you want me to be the bastard . 
every word . 
are you serious ? ? 
could we hear god ? 
for killing a man . 
if you 're here . 
we already have black soldiers in our army ... 
truman , stop it ! 
being rich is < u > not a trap < /u > . that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them . 
nope , there 's no way . 
what do you mean ? 
` thanks for doing this , <person> . ' 
that 's right ! 
outside <person> 's . 
i do n't know . i 'm just starting to remember it now . i do n't ... 
how 's the water ? 
but he is n't going to like this , <person> . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i would n't give him a second thought if not for you . 
<person> , i ... i ...

the storm 's gon na last longer than <number> hours . 
it 's an open ticket . i can go anywhere up to $ <number> . 
whoa , i knew you were going to say that . i absolutely anticipated that , <person> . but i said to myself , <person> , <person> , we can move up on this , so go find <person> ... he 'll be pissed for a moment , but then it 'll dawn on him -- 
i -- 
yeah ... i saw that girl come on to you at the tv show .

a <number> dollars ... and it 's on all night ? 
what about vice-president of the chamber of music , you used that title did n't you ? but then i suppose you had no choice there either , because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying , <person> mr . vice-president .

i have n't been to see the marquis for ages . and i wo n't -- ever again -- i swear it . i wo n't speak to him , i wo n't even utter his name -- 
yes , i believe that 's right . 
i 've taken a lot of morphine . oral morphine ... for my back . can i wait till i can say no and sound convincing ? 
you do n't believe in anything do you , <person> ? 
let 's hope forever . 
they kidded me a little .

man to man , i 'm not . 
my sister ... she lives in the next valley . 
what team ? 
no . but it 's a nice idea . 
i mean , how can you go through life without never having made a prank call ? 
was it ? 
this is the last thing she 'll ever write . she 'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss . 
i 'm an information gatherer . you wan na go somewhere and talk about it ? 
of course . how is the old boy these days ? 
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days , you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs. wheeler . 
i wish they 'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget . our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we do n't have . 
i tracked this <number> , a big buck . god , he was such a beauty -- ! what 's this suitcase here ? 
you know what i mean . your reputation . 
so they tell us . but what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant , and the church , meant to stand for all those oppressed , has become the tool of oppression ? when no conscience is tolerated ? no dissent , no objection ? 
yes , <person> president . 
you 're forgetting <person> <person> ? 
as a matter of fact . i 've given up writing altogether . 
but mine cost the most so i do n't see how it could smudge . 
you 've been interfering with my life ever since i met you . do n't stop now . 
thank you , <person> . 
another distraction . it 's not right . 
i suppose you 'd use them as collateral on new loans , would n't you ? 
this can not be easy for you , captain ... i would feel awkward if i had to give you a tour of our vessel ... 
you hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered ? ! 
no . 
no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it 's been a pointless journey . 
maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic . 
oh , this is just the medical breakthrough i 've been waiting for . are their any side effects ? please say no ! please say no ! 
about <number> . 
aaaahhhh . 
yes ... 
that 's okay . i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it . i hate when people take advantage of tourists . it ruins it for the rest of us . 
yes , air . but i 'm usually wrong . <person> . 
oh , i do n't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon . but in such a deranged state he could harm himself , or perhaps others . 
you talked to his wife ? 
to the asylum ? 
<person> koros . she sensually extends her hand , <person> shakes it - 
right now i would n't be surprised if <person> <person> showed up singing send in the clowns . 
sit down ! when the watchman surprised you , you shot him - what 'd you do with the gun ? 
it was a test . 
and who is we ? 
folks , i 've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig . 
uh-huh ? 
major <person> said he 'd call to let us know . 
not sure . <number> ?

you called the casino a cesspit . 
<person> called at eleven thirty looking for you . you were with her , were n't you ? 
do you want to fuck me up the ass , boy ? is that why you called me a 'ewe ' ? are you a queer ? 
i do n't know . i 'm sort of at a critical ... juncture . 
okay . recommended ... 
some bread and ... 
but ef you *do* whup me , i swear you better not ever go to sleep again , because the minute you go to sleep , or you 're settin ' down , or your back 's turned , i 'm gon na knock you belly-up with a bucket . 
well , they 're my species . 
you supported his application , dr. philby . you are his senior , advisor . i depend upon you to restrain his ... excesses . any repetition of the behavior i witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both . 
if i was <person> , it would be , `` any school you want , precious . do n't forget your tiara . '' 
oh , i get the idea . yeah , maybe . 
why were n't you at the platform ? 
she had the baby ? 
erica . 
they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning . <person> , that 's what you are —— a weak , pale , half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live . 
-- i 'd be the first topoint that out . in all kindness i would . but , like they say , you know , she 's got to want to change , has n't she ? 
i almost had to yoke him this afternoon . tell me , tell me , <person> <person> , to turn my music down . did n't even say please . who the fuck he think he is ? <person> <person> and shit . 
can you shut it down ? 
can you ... can you spare some cutter , me brothers ? <person> rams his stick into the tramp 's stomach . the boys laugh .

i thought so . he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen 's -- 
<person> . you 're trying my patience . <person> <person> is making his private life our business . we gave him kronos . did he say , `` i 'm sick . i might not be able to see this through ? ''

my wife and i are just taking a little vacation . 
where are your parents ? 
he 's got a car ? 
could you see anything ? 
why ? just because you left us standing on the side of the road ? 
let me tell you , honey , midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship . they 're portable . they 're controllable . they 're eager . and they 're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor . 
we 're going to have to reconfigure . 
what ? 
that was terrific . 
we leave <person> in an hour . <person> 's we get some supplies aboard . 
<person> haynes , <person> <person> , i 've told you about <person> a hundred times , <person> , you never remember anything i say .

and i 'm tellin ' you it ai n't ! now , turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here . 
yes , it 's true . they 're going to make it public wednesday but is n't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early ? 
well ... what 's the matter with that ? 
we know you 're a busy man , with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor , and we did . no strings . 
why do you say that ? is there something wrong ? 
<person> <person> <person> . 
all right , then this is old stuff to you . 
that has the added virtue of being true . 
i breathed ! 
rico ! <person> ! <person> ! is that enough ? and keep your meat hooks off my radio . 
those 'fools ' are my people . 
it wo n't work like that . 
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says . so that 's what they built . 
no . i 'm saying they were always fake . the saints , the messiahs , they were just illusionists . 
old habits die hard . are you alright ?

i , i do n't know . 
why ? 
can you give me a realistic idea ... of how long this is going to last ? 
goddamit , <person> -- 
it 's probably because you got him fired . 
do n't say that , we can do it somehow . it might not be perfect , but -- 
a bad attitude . 
nope . i think the man is a liar . 
i do n't agree with you . 
they did too ! 
me arm hurts . 
me and tiny , we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle . 
they 're but off ! do something !

oh , yes , i 'm fine , thanks , just fine .

well , by saying that , you 're acknowledging the existence of a higher power . <person> , to a narcissist , is impossible .

i did n't know . 
why not ? well - nobody 's a great man in your estimation until he 's dead . 
i can look after myself ! 
oh , is he ? you getting jiggy with mantan ? 
no , no , no , most of them -- i used to think all of them -- are just fantasists , guys who get off telling degrading stories . when i came across this fugitive chat room , listened in , i started to think some might actually be real , that they 'd gone live . the challenge was to figure out which was which . then i had my disagreement with <person> . 
it 's all right -- look . 
do you read me ? < u > the list is in the open < /u > ! 
did n't <person> say ? -- he talked to freddie ... apparently it 's not going to work out -- <person> says there are n't enough rooms .

jacob , i do n't believe in demons , not in the empirical sense . i do n't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls . i do n't believe in enternal damnation . i do n't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us . we do n't need them . we do a good enough job on ourselves . 
my step-dad 's . i 'm strictly into stone . i was wondering when you 'd walk by . 
maybe not ... i do n't know . i 'm not sure i 'm gon na go . she does n't need her burn-out of a father there ... 
and i am m'sieu laval -- if you will allow me to introduce myself . 
now you may call it an unreasoning optimism . you may call it obtuse . but the plain fact is we still have ... close to ... close to ... 
look closer . 
goodbye , <person> <person> .

that 's a possibility . y'know you boston cops are perking up . that 's <number> sound theories in <number> day , neither of which deal with abnormally sized men . another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent . 
< i > more < /i > than that . you 'll get used to it . 
his— racket ?

i 'm doing sixty years at otisville , no chance of parole . even if they cut my sentence in half i 'll be seventy-three years old . that 's some fucking deal . i do n't know if the parole board , the judge , the pope or <person> <person> himself can get me out of here . i have a really bad record , i 'm not sure what 's going to happen .

oh , no ! oh , my goodness ! let 's get him into the bedroom . 
then why are you putting on mascara ? 
what ? is there someone else ? 
why would they ? ! who the hell 's <person> anyway ? their parents are gold traders from eastern europe . they buy things . they come to <person> <person> <person> and they buy up things . <number> of the things they buy is the new york times . and you know what ? be proud because they 'll never trust you , sir , because we speak for the average american . 
simple . we sedate him , induce a somnolesent state , and study his rem patterns when he 's unconscious . if he has the disorder , his rems will be highly abnormal . <person> smiles . 
i 'll be right back , baby , really . 
because you 've been down there , <person> . you already know that road . you know exactly where it ends . 
oh , i see . what do you use instead ? 
what do you mean ? 
i better get cleaned up , then . 
go ahead . say it . 
dr. ruth ? 
and not just killed , <person> . we 're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end .

he 'll come down . leave him alone . 
bapu -- please . where are you going . 
oh god . we . liz . we . we . killed a woman . we ...

then let 's do it . 
<person> rice . 
no -- i love you so much and i want you to promise me something . i do n't want you to ever worry about me . if anything should happen , i 'm going to be fine and everything 's going to be all right . -- and i have no regrets . 
not until trading places in '83 . <person> <person> was always the virgin in horror movies . she did n't show her tits until she went legit . 
delinquent property tax notice ... i hope the cracker killers pay well 'cause if not , back to the ghetto you go . <person> stays here , of course . 
which could maybe what ? 
yeah , to play <person> again . 
do n't be silly . i 'll just be ten minutes behind you . 
without a stitch of clothing on , sitting and facing you ... 
excuse me ? 
and i take this < u > opportunity < /u > to suggest that , equally , i admit to < u > nothing < /u > , and that i would like my lawyer present . 
it 's natural . 
<number> down and <number> to go . 
well i 'm the man to see . besides sheriff i 'm also tax collector , captain of the fire brigade , and chairman of the non-partisan anti- chinese league . a man of many parts . got a place to stay yet ? i also sit on the townlot commission . got a couple of lovely cottages coming up for <person> . here , let me show you ... 
just about anything , you know . it can be funny or ... not . just tell me somethin ' . 
i 'm a parent , i do n't have the luxury of principles . 
are you breaking the contract ? 
that <number> , last week . 
the ear is from a missing person maybe ? 
should i call back and talk to your girlfriend ? 
you know , most movies that win a lot of oscars , i ca n't stand . `` <person> 's choice '' , `` ordinary people '' , `` kramer vs. kramer '' , `` gandhi '' . all that stuff is safe , geriatric , coffee-table dog shit . 
whatever . 
oh , who knows ? they do n't know that . prove it . 
maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- 
<number> -- 
so they 're jews . . . 
oh -- you 're <number> of that now ? 
yes , <person> ? 
yes . 
that do n't seem right . it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother . 
ok . 
please ... kill ... 
but it 's not funny now . 
i 'll give you a lift , son . too hot to be walking ... people die out here , y'know . 
i never knew . 
i 'll get you the list of videos , if you do n't mind , i 'll offer the other passengers a beverage . 
that guy <person> came around this afternoon ... asked me if there was a contract out on 'im . 
because i ca n't bear to watch . when they lose , i die inside . it 's like some little person named <person> just crumples up and dies . i wait for the scores . i still die , hearing the scores , but it 's over in a second . i ca n't survive the game pitch by pitch , inning by inning . i 've done it too many times . and i ca n't do it anymore . 
she threw up in her mask , yes . but she had n't eaten <number> hour prior to admission . 
... you got your doctor 's testimony . why do you need me ? 
what ... ? 
he taken the lord 's name in vain and he trampled on his holy book ! 
and getting stranger . where do i meet this cowboy ? i mean do i have to ride out to the range ? 
let 's just go get guns , i 'd feel better . 
former commander ? 
<person> <person> asked my opinion . here we 've got a purported x-ray , dr. lechter 's surgery . do we keep it secret , or broadcast it ? 
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems . 
i do n't want no dirty money . i run an honest business . 
i 'm really glad you think so . 
only on the surface . but that 's all i 've ever seen . 
but you do n't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious , do you ? 
no ! 
now does n't that just make you feel good to say it ? say it with me . 
no . probably i do n't . 
are you her boyfriend ? 
you 're a good man . jimmy the finn . 
very quick . between you and me , it 's not a bad way to go . making love to your wife ... it 's very sweet . 
i already know the way ... and it 's not like i have a job i have to rush home for . between you and me , i could use the time alone . 
really ? in that case , i challenge you to a battle of wits . 
because they 're playing our song . 
-- enough time tomorrow . i know . 
well , i 'm carrying <number> people . and he 's got only himself . 
maybe it 's for the best…i mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrong…people who are bad should be killed . do n't you think so ? 
i may spill something . 
i need to ask you something . 
hey , i 'm fine . <person> , you , how 's your day , our gallant international neighbors ... ? 
he liked to laugh . 
something seem unusual to you about that ? 
maybe ... if you get here on time . 
<number> , mother fucker ' ? now you are fucked . 
how much ? 
<number> to <number> hours . 
no , but i hear it 's terrible . then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child , fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine . 
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it , but right now it 's only money . 
<person> meetoo ! 
what do you mean ? 
good . i mean are we dead or something ? 
yeah , well , all i want is ... just , just do n't be jerking me off . that 's all i ask . do n't jerk me off . 
data ... have n't you ever just played ... for fun ? 
<person> ' comedian . see you tomorrow . 
<person> skin ... 
what 's it called ? 
give us a chance , dad ! 
i 'm not thinking about your future , <person> . i 'm worried about <person> . 
whatcha mean by that ? 
need any company ? 
you do n't believe me ? well , i was working the weekend of the break-in and my god , all the executives were running around like crazy -- you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine -- and when the fbi came to investigate , they never even asked me about it . 
you do n't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make `` friends '' . 
the bridge of death ? ... which leads to the grail ? 
you are mistaken . 
do n't mention it . welcome home , luke . 
<number> cases in <number> years ... 
why ? 
it 's big , <person> . <person> big . it 's called <person> <person> <person> . 
i could n't go near that woman . 
sean , please.. 
i 'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills . 
yeah , but how ? his nose and mouth are blocked . 
same all around ! for my friend , too ! 
emma ! will you *please* -- ? 
`` existential motifs in russian literature '' ! you 're really close . 
until she remarries , fletch . 
we call that <number> muad'dib . 
shut up . you have bread , do n't you , and a toaster of some kind ? 
i did n't know then that i was a nigger . 
goodness is right . if you do the math , that 's over thirty grand a week profit . i want you to be my partner on this , <person> . fifty-fifty . that 's fifteen <number> a week for you , my friend . in your pocket , free and clear . 
what does that mean ? you 've been thinking about the case ? or you thought everything out before you killed <person> ? 
eastern europe . like what ? romania ? hungary ? 
this door 's locked . try shooting the hinges off . 
being here , with me . 
if we get with a counselor . at the church , maybe they 's ... 
real soon , <person> . now shh . 
you talked funny when you went to school here . you talked funny all the way to high school ! 
ca n't remember shit . crs . 
you did n't look then , the way you look now ? 
i 've got a feelin ' today . 
doug , do n't ! 
we 'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe . that 's a perfect excuse . there was no other safe big enough . 
soon ... it 's too bad because they 're very friendly as you can see . i 've grown quite attached to them ... this way . 
who 's the co-pilot ? 
they did n't sign their goddamn tax returns ! 
<person> tramell . it 's part of her game . 
no . 
could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here ? not about this , but ... <person> ? 
you 're such a liar ... 
bring him in . 
i 'm telling you the truth . and after that , i 've always givin ' my money to retards . because that 's the reverse of what he did . 
oh hell yeah . we 's just in the wrong place at the wrong time . so do n't feel so bad dude . 
mm-hmm . <person> & lot longer . 
believe it or not , he told me i had n't heard from him in <number> years because he has n't had any good nightmare . they 're his inspiration . but now he 's got a new script in the works . 
good , then let 's go ! 
`` -- an axe ! '' 
big backyards , fences , some hedges , why ? 
well , go ahead , tell <person> . he 's gon na kill me anyway . it 's a matter of time . 
money ! 
this ocean business ... i know where i can find a map . i need to go back to the station . where will you be ? 
of course -- everything they asked -- 
you just expect me to whip something off , that it ? 
... their damned souls will be ours . 
why ? 
because i 've been kidding myself . because i realized you were right from the beginning . this whole thing was just a wild goose chase . 
there 's no hurry ! the race is over ! 
your chauffeur 's been waiting , <person> . 
mother , go back ! 
what ? 
yeah . what a day . 
why n't you get it dry cleaned and burned . 
flattering . and , who 's your colorful little chum ? 
ca n't remember ? ... what do you mean ? 
<person> , admiral . it was n't mentioned in the job description . 
you listening to me ? 
negative , on surface ... a manufactured object . 
you 're a cop . figure it out . 
why did you do that ? 
cool off , huh ? how 's this for cooling off ? 
what do we do if there is n't ? 
-- i ca n't have every deadbeat on the hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves ! 
i 've just come back from the hospital . your victim has died . 
if i 'm working , i can help you . 
not like this -- 
that would be lieutenant garber , and he 's very busy upstairs ... 
do n't do this ... please ... 
what 's that , <person> ? 
it 's worth a shot . i can arrange a controlled meeting . a careful dose of sedatives for <person> , some security , you and i monitoring . <person> comes in for a quick visit and with any luck , no more missing father complex . 
morning , ma'am . 
are you a relative ? 
ohhh i 've never been there . 
about - thirty-four seconds . 
yeah even then look what happened : <person> <person> kissed you and <person> <person> threw a worm at me . 
we 're bring'n im in tomorrow , <number> am . 
where 's the pinto going ? 
arlyn , he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about . 
there 's about a <number> years ' parole time in there night or day . 
i do n't know about you , but what i did to get through it was i dove into work -- days , nights -- night shifts can be lonely at a hospital . i did a lot of reading . that was hen i first discovered <person> . she made me so happy . she made me forget all my problems . <number> , i suppose you had a little something to do with that too . 
when 's he coming back ... ? 
must be . 
i ca n't do that . he 's the man . he 'll fire my ass . 
no way . 
angelo , it 's eleven thirty . 
i said , i 'm not my sister . 
be nice . that thing saved my life . 
and those who explode bombs in public places , do they perhaps respect the law ? when you asked that question to <person> <person> , remember what he said ? no , gentlemen , believe me , it is a vicious circle . and we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions . because the problem does not lie here . the problem is : the nlf wants us to leave algeria and we want to remain . now , it seems to me that , despite varying shades of opinion , you all agree that we must remain . when the rebellion first began , there were not even shades of opinion . all the newspapers , even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed . and we were sent here for this very reason . and we are neither madmen nor sadists , gentlemen . those who call us fascists today , forget the contribution that many of us made to the resistance . those who call us <person> , do not know that among us there are survivors of dachau and buchenwald . we are soldiers and our only duty is to win . therefore , to be precise , i would now like to ask you a question : should france remain in algeria ? if you answer `` yes , '' then you must accept all the necessary consequences . 
fucking a . 
i know . 
the car does n't vanish <person> . the movie in your head has broken , that 's all . but now i 've re-spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car . 
no . it did n't , <person> . 
please ! and what happens after tomorrow ? 
at least you handle the boat all right . stop . here ... cut the engine . 
what are you talking about , asshole ? 
he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh , it 's a long story . 
black . 
he came tearing around the corner , out of control -- 
not according to his teacher . it just got me thinking about <person> and what if <person> 's inherited his father 's condition ? 
why do n't you put your mother 's secret book back ? 
you do n't like brussel sprouts ? 
you 're in luck ... it says here they 've taken women from several races as indentured servants . 
when you are going to see <person> , does your heart beat until you tremble ? 
no . but i 'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back . 
okay , that 's it . you 're going back to -- 
okay . 
want to sit down ? did you need somethin ' ? 
it was my joke . i was tired , and did not care to go farther . there 's not prettier woman here than that . if she wo n't suit your fancy , my friend , then you must wait awhile . 
so it was n't funny , huh ? well , i thought it was . what d'you say , <person> ? was n't it funny ? ! 
tan ? what tan ? it faded on the airplane . i 'd try to get my money back , but who do you ask ? <number> hundred dollars a night , for what ? 
that-that won ’ t do . that ’ s not the way it goes . you saw it , you tell it , that ’ s the way ... 
you wan na see my politics ? 
yeah . 
it 's what i do . 
i 'll give you <number> guess . 
<person> starks . [ <person> ] thanks . 
maybe . 
look , he 's in pretty good shape . 
if you 're this goddamn smart , how did you ever get caught ? 
carpal-tunnel syndrome . from a life of typing . commendatore . < u > history < /u > , a hazardous profession . 
i 'm so tired ... 
you 're shooting `` bride of the atom . '' <person> <person> . 
ahm - he 's male . he 's english . he 's a doctor of er ... at least <number> things . i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf . or <number> of those guys who kills lots of people all the time . i think we 're looking at someone moderately normal here . 
just what i said . do n't look so scared . 
i know it ! but they 've got nothing to do with this case ! do you realize there are <number> <number> thousand votes at stake and unless we hang <person> <person> we 're going to lose 'em ? 
there 's hot cider in the kitchen . 
the freighter started through at <number> . the sea water seeped into <person> 's watch and stopped it . at <number> . 
think we should call the local p.d . out there first ? 
you 're so easy ... 
< u > nuts < /u > to you too ! 
i 'm lucky i found it . <person> put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage . 
no one knows . the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals . 
are you okay ? what 's the matter ? are you all right ? what- 
turbine rotor 's shot . 
i like to sail , believe me , i love to sail ! instead i make boats and other people sail them . 
oh , that 's the best part . 
you just missed them . 
you 're wrong . they 're fascinating . like in a dream ... there 's truth without logic . what 's his name again ... ? picasso . 
was it <person> ? 
o'grady . 
great . god , i 've wanted you forever . 
<person> <person> ? 
none of your ideas can be goofy , <person> , if they concern me . 
no , its easy . 
i have no idea . 
you flatter me . 
i still do n't think it 's loaded . 
i 'm sure . but what else do you do with your time ? do you go to school ? 
sometimes . 
no problem , sheriff . 
but she was seeing someone else on the side . 
i do n't know what to say except i 'm sorry . i just do n't have rabbits on my mind . 
come on , fergie . a rehearsal . 
walters had nothing to do with your father 's murder . 
a complaint follow-up form . 
what could happen ? i 'm the plastic man , remember ? 
she was hurt ... pretty bad . <person> , they took the little boy with them . 
<person> miles . you know -- he 's organizing the cortina skiing trip . 
i need morphine . a lot . and a pistol . 
... yes . 
hey . you plan to be a criminal defense attorney , know this going in : everybody 's guilty . 
no . 
i hate reading . 
whatever you like . i 'm afraid it 'll all be too big for you . are you alright , <person> ? 
you 're right , <person> . you 're absolutely right . everything 's my problem . 
thanks very much . 
you really are <number> dumb asshole . 
it 's insured . 
it 's his father sir . he 's suffocating him . we 've all seen it ... 
you have grown up very good . 
how long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions ? 
ca n't you see i 'm busy here ? 
oh , <person> <person> , i should have guessed ... 
money -- ever heard of it ? 
on anything male that moves ? as opposed to anything male that does n't move ? 
oh <person> , might n't i touch <number> ? it would thrill me so . 
well it was a friend 's idea , really , and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it . so ... i should really put a <person> <person> in there -- 
you see , particularly with the marge problem , you can just blame me . 
yeah , do n't want to be late for my own funeral . 
will champagne help ? 
tell them what you want . 
that means they 're unemployed . 
no harm done . 
i ca n't take her with me . 
you wrote his scripts for him ? 
... in some weird way i respect that . 
stay where you are . 
it 's actually a very beautiful thing , and look there would n't have been a vada . 
but surely rogers is n't -- 
elementary physics ... a beam of energy can always be diverted ... ooh , my head are we there yet , <person> ? 
the sand . 
keep talking . 
i have to tell you . it 's strange . 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
they got the bull-fiddle . 
i did n't want a piece of yours , i wanted my own . 
yes . 
i 'm helping him bring his money into america . he loves the idea . you just missed him . 
any women on board ? 
now there 's something a girl could make sacrifices for . 
stu ... it 's a < u > party < /u > . 
no , my old man got a place , forty acres . he 's a sharecropper , but we been there a long time . 
my pleasure ... but to be honest , i did have a slightly ulterior motive here . i was wondering if i could ask a small favor ? 
what alien environment ? 
i do n't know if i can . it 's just that war is war . things happen . 
the driver will ... 
oh , all this packing makes me hungry . what would you say to dinner at , uh , oh , <person> <person> ? 
porters ? 
well , this *is* an orphanage . 
oh ? 
i just want you to know that 's why i dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- faulknerian nobody . 
you guys must be starving ... . 
but i 'm not hungry , are you ? 
listen , <person> , you got ta understand my situation . i 'm responsible for thousands of people . i got a <number> <number> a year goin ' through the place . it 's all over , i 'm gon na tell you , it 's all over , if i do n't get that license . and believe me , if it goes bad for me , it 's gon na go bad for a lot of people , you understand ? 
how about `` later ? '' 
the doctor <person> used to go to . he was passing just after it happened . 
well , that 's why they paid so well . 
are you going to kill her ? 
i 'm so glad to see you . you ca n't believe the people in here . they 've got patients posing as doctors ... 
so what ’ s with the nickname ? 
you 've got me all wrong . i do n't charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable ... 
yeah . 
<person> , <person> , have a drink , eat your cake , blow out the candles and make a wish . talk to you monday . <person> ? 
what 's its value today ? 
so your memory 's coming back ? 
did you get it , too ? 
woh , excuse me , <person> ... i see what you 're saying ... i 've got a little indian blood , that 's true . but -- i am not an ... an indian . i ca n't just go in and -- 
i love you too . 
i do n't know . i just want to try it . 
right . 
when you see <person> , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in ... the sooner we back off this reservation . <person> ? 
yeah ... how do you know it ? 
ditched you ? 
next you 'll be sick . 
very logical , <person> ... but your heart does n't constrain itself to mere logic . to leave all of this behind and be with me . 
just for a minute 
max , what is it ? what are you doing ? what 's happening ? 
oh , come on , look who 's talking . you 've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years . you should smoke some o ' this . you 'd be off the couch in no time . 
yeah . 
i ca n't believe it . oh god , i ca n't believe it . you 're an angel , auggie . an angel from heaven . 
i ca n't . 
<person> barbara . i 'll try not to get depressed . 
i think in the spirit of group therapy , it 's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others . 
<person> got very silent about a day ago . <person> <person> 's got a fever for <person> . this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft . people get crazy . and <person> <person> , you should know , is crazy to the tune of <number> years for thirty . signing bonus of <number> . <person> . 
<person> <person> was my mother . do you know who that is ? 
... i heard different , thought that was ... 
i just heard from him -- he 's still hungry . that means killing <person> did n't get it for him -- so he 's narrowed it down to us . you 've got it . 
because i guarantee she 's married and has a couple kids . girls like mary do n't stay single . 
i 'm calling for your brother <person> . he 's getting married and he wants you to come . 
i think i 'll see hat action . 
well , yes , but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend . 
of course . 
his body was found on january <number> , <number> , but do you know if that was long after he had died ? 
- so i watched europe . once you showed up in england..it was easy . 
hey , folklore -- 
it may never come out . 
this way , miss . 
i like to watch . 
wat ... 
no you do n't . and i 'm not gon na screw with my kids heads right now -- 
cuz you 're a cop . 
mmmhmm . 
you 're gon na use a ram ? 
no -- not yet -- but -- <number> tickets to <person> -- first class and sleeper -- night train ... right ... right ... leave them in the name of -- <person> <person> <person> ... right ... thank you . 
i 'm all right . 
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered . i plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket . 
scott , do n't say that ... 
no ... <person> tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity . all of them work for me , and you do n't ... let 's go . 
i do n't rate that at all . 
am i in there ? 
you 're nuts , goin ' back there ! 
do n't worry , <person> . <person> 'll probably get just what he needs . 
i do n't ... it was n't just <number> thing . it was everything . it was them , it was their whole world . and i was trapped in it , like an insect in amber . i just had to get away ... just run and run and run ... and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship ... even the titanic was n't big enough . not enough to get away from them . and before i 'd really though about it , i was over the rail . i was so furious . i 'll show them . they 'll be sorry ! 
thanks , <person> . 
why not ? 
i saw him last night . i thought i was dreaming . i thought i was out of my mind . 
i usually do n't . 
i am a man . 
feed , mostly . thought we 'd get something for the kids . 
but i did live . 
fine , forget it . it 's obvious that we 're not going to be friends . 
i do n't know . he moved away . 
i can not bear to look at that hideous suit <number> minute more . 
no . that 's where <person> fixed the bricks . 
get your own room . 
i 'm fine - it 's just morning sickness . 
who 'll make the rules ? 
chi-chi has gone to doggie heaven , bitch ! 
guns . lots of guns . 
i mean , i need the money . 
unh-uh , pal . you 've got yourself mixed up with somebody else . 
okay , fine . i do n't know shit about shit . but i know the difference -- 
what do you think we 're gon na do ? he 's probably got guys outside the fuckin ' house ! 
<number> pennies and a ball of lint . 
no , just <number> . 
he 'll turn around . 
a bootleg ... 
not so far as i 'm concerned , you 're not . yes ? 
this is hard for me , <person> ... very hard ... but it 's been <number> months now , and ... < i > < /i > i gave the order . 
but have them wait for me 'till they move in on him . 
what do you mean ? 
tomorrow is her birthday and i want to get her something really nice , like a ... 
let 's get away from here . 
more than <number> years .

my son ? 
and you were with <person> . he was my roommate in flight school . 
what 's that , <person> ? 
well , let 's do it . 
have i done the right thing ? 
but i like the presidential suite . 
maybe there are notes or drawings of this place , showing how those plates work . 
leave a tip . 
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative . whom do you think i should believe ? 
hon ... i did n't want to die , but really , this is fine with me . as long as i never have to wash dishes again . 
that 's right . 
look , <person> , ca n't we have a civilized discussion about this ? 
i almost saw catalina . 
yeah ; it was great money ... i could make a dollar a day , sometimes . but only in summer . when it got cold , i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing . 
i do if you do . 
-- i wanted to be him . <person> then i wanted to be him more than anything ... 
wait . 
well , take them off . 
i 'm sorry ? 
<person> stetz . her boyfriend . we 've questioned him , searched his place . did n't find anything . 
yeah , how much you wan na bet ? 
<person> president , there is another possibility we have n't considered . this may not be a coup at all . 
`` we '' ? 
just like that ? 
be a gentleman . you have to help me down . 
am i ? 
what do they do that they had to kill her ? 
really ? yeah . <person> . 
<person> lloyd . 
maybe there 's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours . say that you 'll do it for me and my friend , <person> <person> , here . 
out shopping -- you 're bleeding , dad -- 
i 'd just like to get to the point , <person> <person> . <person> 's not waste these people 's time . answer the question , mr . witness . please . would a <number> minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence ? 
oh , come on -- you and grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant . when <person> -- 
do n't thank me . <person> <person> . it 's his will that we should survive . well . that 's what we have to believe . 
huh ? 
thank you . 
well , first of all , it 's entomologist . 
fuckin ' a . 
end up in a high-profile lawsuit with <person> , the first amendment martyr ? i do n't think so . take a look at this ... this is a summary of a dossier that 's being prepared . 
exactly . 
come on , let 's go ... 
no , he was wrong , <person> , i did n't find out . 
i do n't care . i just do n't have what it takes . they 'd be better off with someone who 'd never flown before . 
no ? funny that . neither did i . 
what if i were to say `` you 're fired ? '' 
we are launching everything we have . 
no problem , amigo . 
i 've already lost it . 
v'ger is that which seeks the creator . 
it 's a desert . that 's what deserts do at night ; they get cold . 
oh , please . i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i do n't see all my kids here . 
you 'll love it . no base , no bars , just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance . 
rod , i 'm not a rascist . i 'm telling you to be the best version of you , to get back to the guy who first started playing this game . <person> back when you were a kid . it was n't just about the money , was it ? 
oh , <person> ... 
another woman ? 
deanna , on my mark . 
oh , heavens - i must say , yes . 
and to think i thought you were <person> <person> in pumps . 
a lincoln ? what <person> ? <person> <person> ? <person> <person> <person> ... six ... ? 
you please me , <person> <person> . a very clever idea . 
maybe someday . 
sneaking around with your brother ? 
a true friend would do it . 
maybe we should pay luther a visit . 
you 're in gun country now , my friend . 
i can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when <person> and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root . i can hear the alice-sit-by- the-fires now : `` we discovered it in the amazon rain forest . now we cure you with it . now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks . '' 
you know ? 
just in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
lucy ! be serious . we could be executed for treason ! 
but everything that 's happening is good ! you can be a part of it ! 
no sand . that 's your drugs speaking . 
nothing . 
where were you ? 
is that all ? charlie what else do you want ? 
i know of no better time . 
you 're his friend , <person> . why ca n't you leave him alone ? 
no . 
why does it have to be goodbye ? 
we also got <person> <person> and <person> <person> . 
you fit a lot of descriptions . 
risa , i serviced that bus . at the garage . there 's nothing wrong with it . 
who is <person> ? 
so who was <person> talking to at the last minute ? nobody . 
i want you for my roommate . 
if i tell you where <person> 's headed , you promise it 'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else ? 
guess it 's never been easy . 
is that all you 've got to say to me , <person> ? 
what team ? 
please ... 
mr.wallace <person> is in the executive building on the second floor . we want to go in and turn right at the first street . then we want to walk <number> blocks down past stage <number> to the white executive building . once we 're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there . now do we have name ? 
just give it a nice little tap . 
what are you talking about ? 
i do n't want to do that , 
you hear me complaining about that ? 
what 's your relationship ? 
magua say : `` yes . good idea . '' 
never touched me . 
you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways . <person> man , i 'm blacker than you . i 'm keepin ' it real and you 're frontin ' , trying to be white . 
what 's your location ? i repeat , what 's your location ? 
look , you 're not gon na take <person> 's camper . 
now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a successor to our dear friend , <person> <person> . 
while i find that fascinating , <person> , we really need that goddamned door open ! 
the world is fantastic . it 's the ultimate absurd circus . i am shot from a cannon into the energy . 
so if his head struck something narrow and flat , the gunnel of a boat , a net roller , a fairlead , could that have ... 
is it intelligent ? 
a complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition . definitely not part of the big auto show . there 's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location . 
i do n't get it , that really works ? 
a cure ? 
what a peculiar question . 
no , i 'm fine , thanks . 
i know who you are <person> <person> . your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous . some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive . 
what 's the fuss ? i do n't get it . 
her ? ... oh -- the first lady ... she was giving that commencement speech up in bryn mawr . i managed to catch her before she left the hotel . 
we redesigned the timing mechanism . it ca n't possibly malfunction . 
where are you , anyway ? 
you still owe me ten bucks from last week , if that 's what you 're working up to . 
are you feeling better ? 
bet you say that to all the girls , <person> <person> . 
have you ever been in love ? 
why ? you wanted for a crime , <person> ? 
what 's happening to us ? 
when i was an ensign , i could detect a three-micron mis- alignment ... 
no . 
what do you do , fink ? 
passing <number> . passing <number> . lock your harness ! 
you ca n't come here . 
yes . 
i see . are you a socialist , <person> <person> ? 
they kid a lot . 
i 'm not afraid . frida ! i love you . 
we just did . 
of course he is , but at least there is n't a security guard outside my door . 
well here 's the purse . 
i mean new york 's <number> thing , but can you see this guy , imagine it , running around the goddam beach all suntan and he 's going in swimming , like , and then somebody yells <number> , <person> ' -- how does that sound to you ? 
i am . let me get the cards . 
what are you talking about ? who 's <person> ? 
my friend , with the funny hand . 
d.c. 's very high on giving you the promotion . there 's just <number> problem . 
you want to talk about this ? 
i got big ideas , though ! 
i was talking about you . 
i 've been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ? 
football is my life . 
see you later . 
yes , i remember . he was all schoolyard . they threw him a football once , he tried to dribble it . 
it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want . what is it you want ? 
no , honey , it 's the police . <person> , officers . 
it 's not that simple . <person> money , planning . you ca n't just up and go . oh , i 'm going to do it , do n't worry about that . i 've just got to move slow . <person> my moment . <person> time 's just around the corner . soon as i finish the ... 
what 'd ya see ? 
what killed him ? 
fifteen for a straight delivery . <person> with the provision of a safe place . visitors tend to find the second option more convenient . 
for a month . 
how many employees ? 
a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and -- 
hell , i know how it ends . hey , <person> 's the sled ! 
cuz let me tell you , you boys got ta run the ball more . you get into a kicking game , ya 'll gon na lose . 
<person> ! 
but you are aware , he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager . 
occasionally . always on the lookout for the future ex- mrs. malcolm . 
i wo n't light the cigars - how about that ? 
come on . where do you want to go ? anywhere you want . just say it . i can get us in anywhere . 
is it pretty ? 
i knew you would come . 
did n't you get my message ? 
that 's right , white bread . give it up . right now . 
why do n't you let me ? 
that 's right , <person> . mind if i come in ? 
if it would n't be too much of a bother ... a little bite to eat would be ... 
mr decker ... . 
what i 'm not . 
quod nomen mihi est ? 
what 's going on ? 
do you still feel suicidal ? 
soo -- pah doo -- per . 
i may have said perhaps ... 
colonel <person> sent him . he was <number> of our mohawk allies . 
do you believe in love ? 
so why tell me now ? 
it 's not gon na be easy . your brothers can possess people . so they probably wo n't look like themselves . you have to be suspicious of everyone . 
no , i like him . 
oh , that ... sure , i saw the whole thing . it was disgusting ! 
did you come here with <person> -- to *not* watch movies ? 
well , i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning , <person> <person> . i wouldn ’ t like to think i ’ d kept you waiting for nothing . 
and . it 's wrong . 
michael , will you do me a favor this evening ? will you stay home with <person> tonight ? i 'm meeting <person> for dinner after work . 
marco ... 
you mean that 's what you 're going to call it . 
well , she 's running now , too . these fucking people like to run , do n't -- 
sleep is something <number> must learn to overcome . i learned how to do it when i was a child . i never slept . and i had friends who even slept less than i did . the one who went to bed first , paid a penalty . and we really did n't do anything . after seeing a movie , we 'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while ... then we 'd sit down on a bench somewhere ... listen to some drunkard ... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes ... or look at the sheep passing by ... or go for a stroll around the market place ... or else we 'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name ... 
what ? 
... to get her heartbeat back ... ? 
he ca n't be far . 
none whatsoever . 
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in ? 
the nightmares . 
the doors and walls are monitored , mrs. peel . this is a very secure establishment . 
he 's dutch . you ca n't even speak dutch . 
nepal ? have you been ? 
i know it sounds like a lame question , but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question , but last month-i do n't know if you 've heard about this , but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- 
that 's not the reason . i 've got a date at <number> thirty . 
speaking of which ... 
that 's not how he tells it . 
sign . 
we nev -- we do n't name names ! we say the pope . 
stay in the truck . 
where is he ? ? ? 
i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes . 
what do you want to do ? 
i 'm really beat . i need some serious `` z 's '' -- 
yah , how much money was that ? 
oh shit . <person> ... what 're you doing ? 
no . 
all the time , sir . 
ok . 
is it that obvious ? 
but <person> did n't -- he still thought -- ! 
it 's the same choice you made . 
i 'll get my hat . 
it 's only meaningful when you 've got <number> lines of code to back it up . 
it claims to restore monthly regularity . 
yeah , well , actually ... 
we 'll cut him in on the bets we make . and still have enough profit to send ho-jon to college . 
wait till you see her , auggie . 
i *did* like it . all i said was , `` it 's not 'king <person> ' . '' 
... i know , i 'm so ... because i said : yes , a woman who ... the ... the community < u > respects < /u > her . please do n't go . please do n't go . what can i do but beseech you ... ? trauma , < u > toil < /u > ... when are we free of them ... ? when ... ? 
what did you want to be , <person> <person> <person> ? 
yes , i photograph very well . look -- 
so ? 
that 's ridiculous . 
okay . 
no , this is on the level , <person> . i 'm not good enough to make this <number> up . the sheriff gave his gun to the professor , the professor gave it to earl , and <person> gave it right back to the professor -- right in the stomach ! who ? no , <person> was n't hurt badly . they took him to the county hospital where they 're afraid he 'll recover . 
parasolutrine ? 
we 've only been over this how many times ? 
i don ’ t . 
edmunds ? can you copy ? 
look -- i 'm tired , i 'll see you in the morning , <person> . 
goodbye . 
you never know . you may someday dine at the white house with the president . 
yeah , it 's subtle . 
it 's hard to figure . he went out several time last night , in the rain carrying his sample case . 
they have done nothing of the sort . 
i 'm sure there 's more than that ... fucking pigs always travel in packs ... ... here , take this . 
not luck . they do n't want me . 
let us explore it together . 
what about me ? 
<person> <person> ? 
can you develop an ulcer in <number> minutes ? being cool is hard on your body . 
`` ray ! '' 
but you ca n't just kill a man for his teeth ! 
no , it 's <number> <number> dollars . 
you listen carefully ! you ever fuckin ' touch her again , you ever do anything like that again , i 'll fuckin ' kill you . pure and simple . do you hear me ? pure and fuckin ' simple , i 'll fuckin ' kill you , you bitch . 
i only went for my last <number> years . 
he was just laying all his things out on <number> of the beds ! coats , suits , shirts , sox , even his wife 's -- 
thank you . 
will i see you tonight ? 
i admit i may have seen better days , but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut . 
how do i know you wo n't keep them all ? 
no , sir . 
well , it 's a wide range of , eh -- 
okay . 
how does a nice cup of cocoa sound ? 
i'1l get your bag . 
i know what i am . i do n't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder . 
think you can narrow it down for me . 
your shrink always gives you bad advice . he only hears what you choose to tell him . <person> 's an asshole , he cheated , he borrowed money and never paid it back , he 's never had a regular job . 
had . she died in a car accident last year . she was decapitated . 
then she 's not as smart as i thought she was . you 've seen her in the depositions . tell me you do n't have any doubts ? 
right now at least <number> girl is dead and <person> <person> is in there fighting for her life . she is the last of his blood line . if she dies -- 
well , perhaps sometime we ... 
six . their plane went down right outside scranton . 
i 've never been supercargo . 
and she 's turned you into a servant . 
all i know is -- he said to me tonight -- `` what does your wife think ? '' my wife . thinks we 're married -- 
i almost did n't . 
oh , yes -- yes -- that 's right -- 
hey man , do n't sweat it . 
looks lonesome -- bring him over here . 
we 've got to move fast . this is an idea whose time has come . 
just , i mean , well , you 're here every single day . 
hyggelig a mote dem . <person> <person> <person> <person> . 
i do n't have a boyfriend . 
captain ? 
all right ! 
what ? 
right . <person> . so , how about we take a bath together ? 
and keep your sword greased . 
so you killed them ? 
not my people . 
you would ? really ? 
i 'm trying to be delicate with you , but you 're not understanding me . it 's not just because of carl , or my music , but because of you ... i mean , what would it come to ? if a person has no love for himself , no respect , no love for his work , his family , his friends , something ... how can he ask for love in return ? i mean , why should he ask for it ? 
i wan na be wrong here . but we need to go to the precinct and talk about it . 
bad games , bad towns , bad pay , bad flights , bad hotels , real bad food . <person> , rootless , lonely , maybe your copy gets into <number> issue out of <number> ... 
bullshit . 
i 'm not snow . 
would such , a demonstration be possible before the meeting ? 
are you sure you do n't ? 
it was n't a school like yours and there was no sister <person> . 
yeah yeah , we 'll think on it . 'bye ya , <person> . you relax up there , ya hear ? 
he came to see mr kinnear . 
exactly . you see , it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old russia . the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming , and you know how vain women are . 
show me . 
small brains make your balls itch ? 
me ? i could never go to a place like that . 
no we do n't ... 
dick , you do n't have to make a statement . <person> covered it for you . 
we made it ! 
throw that money in the river ! in the river ! 
you better make sure your old man asks her out , because if he does n't , they may never have a first date . and if they do n't have a first date , they wo n't have a second date . if they do n't have a second date , they wo n't fall in love . if they do n't fall in love , they wo n't get married , and if they do n't get married , you 'll never be born ! 
no . you can be mine ! 
how can this be ? you and me at the same time , the exact same thought . it 's scary . 
<number> o'clock , work the phones 'til you go . 
`` deserve '' do n't mean shit , <person> <person> . 
we can learn something from our asian friends . they smoke a thousand cigarettes a day ; they 're completely stressed and overworked ; they drink like , well ... 
... .getthat on the tv ... .there ... 
i do n't know the kid , and what little i do scares me . 
really ? 
but you ca n't kill the bogyman . 
no , they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business . i grew up here , and i know my way around the studios . 
thanks . 
and then , something did . <person> <person> was found dead . with his head crushed . 
what ? 
oh , <person> , do n't upset yourself so . 
i 've offered you some warm broth . i thought perhaps- 
it 's absolutely not like that ! this is for your own good ! come on get the rest of your armor on ! 
i would . but i 've got a weak stomach . 
well , at the end of the day ... because of your segment ... the brown & <person> <person> <person> ... could own cbs . 
did she always have nightmares ? 
i might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you . maybe an even hundred . 
what 's your subject ? 
we 're not upset with you , <person> . we think you did a terrific job . do n't we ? 
oh . does that make you sad ? or anxious ? i 'm always anxious thinking i 'm not living my life to the fullest , y'know ? taking advantage of every possibility ? just making sure that i 'm not wasting <number> second of the little time i have . 
well , you were right about what that bartender said . 
well ... 
you know , i-i think ... if i could pry this door off ... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they do n't have legs . they do n't run around . 
maybe ya better forget it . 
i do n't blame you ! it 's not about that ! it 's about the boy ! 'cause he 's a good kid ! and i wo n't see this happen to him -- i wo n't see you make him feel like a failure too ! 
your instructors tell me you 're doing well . top quarter of the class . 
norman <person> ' mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years ! 
true . 
yes ... 
‘ <person> <person> ’ . newman street . ask for <person> . 
i 'd sooner swim ! 
i kissed her while she was laughing . 
the prison board made the decision . a board of which i belong . we 're the who . the why is simple . <person> and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor 's care , where hopefully they 'll receive the help they need . 
and <person> ? 
we 're going to speak to her . 
i 'll bet you ca n't remember what you were doing here , can you ? i mean , how much are you making now ? sixty ? seventy ? and you were living in this shitty place . 
anyway , i was just showing you this guy as an example of what 's available -- i did n't think you 'd be interested . 
yes ! do n't you remember the day you took that chinese vase from the royal palace and made it into a lamp for my night table ? 
we sure did , but we had to go in hiding for a week . 
you think <person> killed her ? 
good to see you , <person> . <person> 's everybody doin ' ? 
no charge . 
my papa taught me <number> thing : do n't never bullshit a west indian bullshit artist . 
we 've been ordered to - 
you know better than to interrupt me . 
you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , i 'm telling you . 
say , is n't that dr. <person> , the world- renowned agronomist ?

as much as i do . it 's not that . i do n't want to be depressing , that 's all . 
that 's all i want ... it 's the only thing i have ever wanted . 
well , i 'm no doctor . all i know is , the next day they had really high fevers , and their faces got very fat . they baffled medical science , they were in a magazine . 
you wan na know ? well , since you 're so goddamn curious , i 'll tell ya . <number> of you toons killed my brother . 
yeah . it 's a fact . 
well , where are you --

because i wanted to .

she undressed alone ... she bathed alone .

that 's what he told himself . but it was n't even about me , it was about <person> . he wanted what <person> had . that 's how they are . i understand them . 
nineteen ! my dear young man ... once the human organism has ceased to function , nature has deemed that creature to be dead .

no argument . 
you dodged a bullet . 
yeah . 
i want to see . 
that 's it ... <person> <person> . 
yes it is . 
what kind of man are you ? are you a good man ? 
for that i 'd kill a nun on <person> sunday . 
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half <person> . you know how long it took me to find that hose ? 
stellas . i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs . 
you wo n't consider another course of action , for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ? 
i wish there were something more i could do to help you . 
our moms suck ! 
not wrong , dumb ass , wong ! you know , like the chinese name ? 
what book ! 
not all ... but it feels like a kiss .

business . i need to leave town and i find myself in dire need of some cash . 
no , you fucked you ! do n't invert stuff ! big <person> tried to smear wigand ; you bought it . the wall street journal , here , not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment , refutes big <person> 's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination ! and now , even now , when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed , the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi , the cat totally out of the bag , you 're still standing here debating ! <person> , what the hell else ... do you need ? 
you must be new in town . 
we live in <number> . 
<number> years . 
and that you 're stupid ? 
<person> . what happened to your date ?

what are you doing ? 
i 'd like to hit this guy on a gut level . 
resting up ? <person> <person> , i 've got to go with <person> on this one . i hate to think we 're just in this for the money . <person> 's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she 's got to get spayed . we 're going out of oasisburg on a win . 
all right ... elevate me ! 
she 's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone . 
i 'll give it my best shot , mother fucker . 
i 'm not a podiatrist , i 'm a cardiologist . 

<number> including you . 
tell me what it is . where do you go ? what takes you away ? 
what ? bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off ? 
thanks . 
i 'm not interested in you . you disgust me . i 'm interested in my own nature and know i ca n't trust you to tell me the truth about me . 
you sure you do n't wan na ... ? for old time 's sake . if you do n't trust me , you can tie me up . 
ev-i-dence . 
good call . 
forty-five thousand . 
do you realize how hard it 's going to be to tell my parents ? i still have n't told them i did n't get the pilot . 
you need some convincing . consider it a convincer . 
you 're sure ? 
well , i hope she was n't too much of a disappointment to you , <person> . 
<number> seconds . 
<person> ' trouble for someone ? 
you mean that was a ... 
“ ... but it ’ s getting there . “ 
it is kind of rough . 
understood . 
you want some too ? 
he has a point . on my planet children often play with ape dolls . 
tired ? 
but really , m'sieu , this is n't necessary . 
the inheritance . 
i love you ... 
you would n't . 
you 're lying . 
reluctant to speak , eh , <person> ? well , i can understand that . when a man loses everything , anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time . just give it some thought , work with the idea , i 'm sure you 'll have plenty to say in a few days . 
wait , do n't hang up . 
<person> . 
no . i mean , i remember mrs. ansel wearing some of this stuff , but ... i do n't feel funny about that . i really liked her . 
<person> spanked a waitress ? 
your compliment was sufficient luis . 
you 're crazy . 
a little mushy ! you think the taxpayers would like it , utah , if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls ? 
oh , go on . have <number> . fuck it . you think you 're going to live forever ? 
go on— beat it . do n't push your luck . 
no name . you sure ask a lot of questions . 
let 's dig in ! 
i got ta go home and get my hat . 
who knows ? that 's why i filed it down . 
it does n't look like it . 
oh , i can explain about that later . you 're losing your bank - do n't you realize what that means ? 
mmm-hmmm ... 
it 's your play . 
she 's workin ' the late shift at the hospital . she 's at home now , i 'm going over there to talk to ... 
and to history . 
fine . send it right away . i do n't want him to fire <person> . 
we see each other every couple of months . 
thanks , curly . call me jake . 
you mean my problem ? 
soon he 'll be a plastic cube . 
i think she 's in with them . 
quite right , but we still make the rules . 
i mean it . i do n't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries . 
where did you hide it ? 
not a drop . maybe the guy works for the red cross . 
<person> god ! 
sure . mate in <number> moves . 
and you want me to do you some big favor ? 
have you had any dizzy spells this week ? 
he 's a very unusual android . 
well , that 's , that 's , i 'm not go inta , inta - see , i just need money . now , her dad 's real wealthy - 
haddonfield . it 's a <number> hour drive . you can reach me through the local police . if you did n't find him in <number> hours , i 'm sure i will . 
fuck you . 
i think you 'll find it normal enough . 
about <person> ... 
there is no handle ! you just push a button . 
as do you . 
yes -- you are . 
take some allergy medicine . 
sarah . 
oh , no , no , no . y'see , <person> , as it happens , that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams . and she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice ! 
instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul . 
did they win ? 
how come you do n't know it ? how can you say you hate the jews when you do n't know anything about -- 
there 's no sin in charity , <person> . 
simply preposterous . do you know what i did last night ? last night , <person> <person> , i held a sort of a self- inventory . i said to myself last night , <person> <person> , i said , `` lovey '' — <person> <person> ! `` <person> <person> , '' i said , `` you are an ungrateful fool . . . `` 
hotel ? what were they doing in a hotel ? 
well , sir , he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time . 
i 'm sorry , <person> <person> , i count only <number> . 
i understand . 
i 'm going to be completely honest . i 'm not going to lie to you . i ca n't make the police let you go ... but i do want to help you . and i want you to trust me . can you do that , <person> ? may i call you `` <person> '' ? 
winter with the delaware , my father 's cousins . and in the spring , cross the ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called can-tuck-ee . 
no you 're not . <person> <person> is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he 's got the ambition . you have n't got the ambition but luckily you 've got me . and mr helpmann . mr <person> was very close - 
<person> <person> , my aide , lieutenant casselle . 
i ca n't right now . i 've got a game . 
i can show you how to get out of prison . and it 's no hype . 
i 'll let you off while it 's still daylight . 
then why you going out with him if he 's a schlep ? 
why not ? 
yes , but i 'd sort of like to put that behind me now ... 
<person> , i -- 
you do n't think he 'd be sap enough to do the job himself . i hope they give him the works . even if he did n't kill the kid , he 's responsible for her death , and they can fry him any time without making me sore . 
what ? 
who is <person> ? 
no . please , <person> . why are you in so much trouble ? 
-- then you do n't need me . 
well , <person> 's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra , so at the moment , there 's just <person> , <person> and myself ... and <person> <person> . 
jesus . is that what he told you ? 
come here a minute . 
that is the point ... and <person> 'll slip off the hook . 
i do n't know anything about a faction . i just met <person> ... or whatever his name is ... a couple of weeks ago . i barely know him . 
they 're paying him scale . 
<person> ' . 
i 've brought you some things . i hope you 'll like , <person> <person> . i hope you do n't think it too forward . 
he 's a bad man . sends people to siberia ! 
no . of course you 're not . you 've just hurt your back . that 's all . you 're going to be fine . it 'll just take some time . 
it might help my analysis if i knew what <person> was . 
what do you do ? 
<person> . 
i 'm so glad . you know , i recognize that passage in your book . the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre . 
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other . where they lived the other 's life for a day . you know those guys share everything , right ? 
how you and ma doing ? have n't seen you in town for a while . 
we 've only just read about it in the morning papers . 
i kind of half expected you to thank me . 
i do . 
sits down next to honora , glass of sherry in hand . 
no , we were patients . 
what do you know about them ? 
we learned he 'd found the immigration notaries in liverpool and traced them to new york . then he figured out the birth records in church hill ... 
nothing . not a thing . i 'm right as the mail . 
<person> . <person> . i want to talk to you . permit me to do this a second . i 'm older than you . a man acquires a reputation . on the street . what he does when he 's up , what he does otherwise ... i said `` ten , '' you said `` no . '' you said `` twenty . '' i said `` fine , '' i 'm not going to fuck with you , how can i beat that , you tell me ? ... okay . <person> . we 'll ... okay . <person> . we 'll ... <person> , twenty percent , and fifty bucks a lead . that 's fine . for now . that 's fine . a month or <number> we 'll talk . a month from now . next month . after the thirtieth . we 'll talk . 
where ? 
they do n't have that kind of money , <person> <person> . you know that . you 're the only <number> in town that can help me . 
enigma . 
what d'you think ? 
that 's not what you said . 
we proceed , representing your estate . 
lem me down , bugface ! 
<person> dealer . 
just an idea , but let 's just fucking split . we 'll meet up anywhere . <person> or <person> or atlanta . anywhere ... 
we 're fine ! how are you ? 
how 's egghead ? 
and who remembered it ? who was there on the dot , at twelve midnight ... ? 
<person> 's trying to keep him upstairs . 
oh , <person> is pretty harmless , really -- 
i empathize with your plight , fletch . however , you threw her out . 
jobs doing what ? 
heather , i feel awful , like i 'm going to throw up . can we jam , please ? 
burt , can you hear me now ? 
another coincidence . 
that ’ s right . and auto supply ... 
what i 've always wanted , to teach you . 
... but the person who has it . tricked me , and sent me to the phantom zone . 
i 'll make it up to you ! 
you 're upset . 
they gave you a pardon , man . whatdaya want ? 
slim , but yes , there 's a chance . they have a shelter . it 's not much , but ... 
ok. ssh . <person> . 
i know how it feels to be dead . 
a bad climb , no , just another challenge . what 's life without 'em , right , <person> <person> . 
hi . 
... standard issue ... 
no . 
i walked into it knowing i 'd get hurt , but i thought i could stand anything . i just was n't ready for that kind of pain . we were supposed to meet in l.a . when i got back there , he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife . 
he ai n't dead ? you did n't get him ? 
marty . 
you can swim ? 
hey ! <person> ' a ! just ... just like a hot shit ... except cold . 
ya know ... `` it '' . 
saw my outfit or something , my coat -- 
is this like a trick question ? 
out where ? 
we 're all excited around here . my brother just got the congressional medal of honor . the president just decorated him . 
you missed the last <number> , including her birthday . your wife 's gripe sheet . 
you can be my special friend and come and put that in me . 
john -- does n't -- matter ! ca n't i get that through your head , you poor , silly , disgusting little wretch ! 
-- well , more than anything else -- -- i 'd like to suck his cock . 
so you ca n't talk to me ? 
yes . good morning , saunders . have you -- uh -- any idea how this happened ? 
i 'm afraid . 
... <person> ... 
look at your reflection in the mirror ! ! 
and you ca n't tell me who you are . 
so you tap everyone 's phone ? you use computers to probe financial records ? new search and seizure laws ? 
if you 're going to be indiscreet , i wish you 'd be a little more discreet about it . <person> men , like winton , love you and leave you . 
at the top of the empire state building -- 
i 'm like a joke to them . 
come on malcolm , it 's only <number> ohms , it 's nothing , it 's like a joy buzzer ! and it 's not about the pain , it 's about the interference with concentration ... 
where does he get off to talk that way to a working man ? it 's not ... 
well , you just have to move further out . 
<person> , i think you better stay ... . 
you got ta push the little yellow button ... 
no you wo n't . 
right . and then communication satellites , and then anywhere . 
we all got a secret side , baby . hope you do n't think i been lyin ' to you 'bout other things , sugar . 
you 're tootin ' we 're gon na stay . 
<person> christ . <person> <person> ! anybody else hurt ? 
well ... i do n't know - it was weird . at first it felt icky , then it felt kind of okay . then , i started getting really hot and then i started shaking and then like , i do n't t know ... it felt like an explosion , but a good <number> . 
you know , <person> , i 've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy ... i mean , is this what i get first thing ? before you even `` hello , '' you accuse me ... ? 
maybe i should n't take it . 
shhhh ! do you want to frighten our little daughter ? 
you 've met her parents . 
you 'd prefer that ? ... <person> ... you do n't really have a gun , do you . 
i am . and you 're will . i 've seen your picture , that 's how i recognize you . i almost said something at the store , but it would have been awkward . like this . 
i have people in york estates right under your nose . if you do < u > anything < /u > except what i 'm telling you , you 'll get <person> and <person> back in the mail . we clear on that ? 
i tremble with fear ! you 're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound ! 
relax . we 're almost there . 
yessir . we should a brought wieners . 
they 're mesmerising . 
hugo . 
i sleep it off . 
the <number> in the street . i chased after you . 
it 's home . 
of course . 
why should i ? you need practice . i can teach you to fight with the green destiny , but first you must learn to hold it in stillness . 
luke . where you goin ? 
right ! that 's exactly what i 'm saying . my father said , first of all , i 'm your father not your friend . i 'm your father . 
who ? 
you know i did n't ever want to hurt you . 
no . 
i do n't know . i better get off now . 
over here . 
because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more , <person> . you 're a pleasure to me . 
you do ? 
do n't mention it . and do n't try anything , either . i got a tire iron right where i can get at it . 
those are n't mine . 
i wish i could be that way . 
find a new job . 
because i 'm happy . 
first things first . 
what do i do meanwhile ? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me ? 
of course you will look mean , <person> , you will look really scary . 
it 'll yank him right off his feet if he 's not expecting it . the line could get tangled in something . 
i 've got my suspicions but still , nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off <number> person . 
yeah . 
<number> more , eh ? 
for your breath . you could use it . <person> some in your mouth . 
that 's it -- there 's nothing like being twenty-two . now may i suggest that if we 're ever to finish this story you keep at least <number> feet away from me ... now back to the typewriter . 
i guess it was a little too inconvenient . so for fourteen years , this stuff flowed into the groundwater , free as you please . 
let 's see your bread . 
what sign ? fuck the sign . i want my car . 
uh-huh . <person> for you . 
you mean , am i gon na help you kill them cowboys ? 
i ca n't tell . 
never , oh ! never , nothing will die . the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die . 
rose , we have a crisis . i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against <person> <person> . 
mm—hmm . 
what do you think ? <person> likes it . 
mourning . maybe watch some t.v . why ? 
well , <person> , i only wear them in washington -- that 's the trouble . but if you ever come down there , i 'll show them to you . 
the bearded guy , the creep . oh , <number> other thing . <person> , if that 's his name , he kept mentioning my feet . said i had very pretty feet . 
the old man cheats on his wife with her own clone ? 
<number> , <number> months ago . when i was at computer crime . i got into a chat room with someone named mydick . i 'd talked to him before . everything i saw yesterday , everything in the autopsies , it 's identical . the forensics are dead on . mydick 's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig , nylon cord , torture with pliers , rip the nipples -- when the `` item '' screams , she chokes . he had a thing about eyes , always the eyes -- stab their eyes . it 's the same guy . <person> was mydick . 
you know anybody that 's got an army for rent , that 's fine ... but my , uh , <person> said to go take that sucker out . an ' let 's face it , the big ox is n't gon na get any weaker . i feel like hittin ' him now , while i 'm good an ' mad . some nerve ... what does he care whether you guys get killed , long as he keeps rakin ' in quarters ? 
i thought you were watching him . 
on the back it has -- 
come now , mr . chance . 
well , there 's a good amount of agreement on that . 
did you ask walter to get you a shrink ? <person> , did you ask <person> to get you a shrink ? what 's wrong with you ? are you ok ? 
that 's what you 've been looking for -- a farter ? 
<number> in each ear . what would you do without me ? 
do you believe him ? 
i do n't mean nothin ' by it . i just do n't know many regular girls , that 's all . 
let me get this straight . we drove all the way down to klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking ? 
but the second mouse gets the cheese . 
winifred , the kids want you home and so do i . 
what do you think you were in your previous life , <person> ? 
if there 's anything i can do for you - 
with trina . 
thank you , <person> . 
at times . at other times i think she was ... more . but who would know that better than you . i mean , you sure 'nough you her . 
no , last night i think i chased <person> around as a wolf and killed him . i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed . and my throat hurts . 
if he does it 's his own fault ! but i 'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh . 
ah . <person> . it 's good . it 's great . 
well ... 
very well . 
perfect ... 
just the same . 
i do n't understand -- 
nothing . i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs . 
you mind your own business ! she 's an old friend of mine and i like her -- what 're you going to do about it ? 
because we 're pals - buddies - the <number> musketeers . 
they 're converting the deflector dish into an antennae ... 
i do n't find this `` turning the tables '' thing very interesting -- 
i -- i 'm afraid i ca n't -- not right now . can i talk to you later ? . yes , that 'll be fine . 'bye . 
yup . do n't you want something to eat ? 
i know what you mean . 
well , we 're fbi agents . 
are you getting <person> something for her birthday ? 
sure . where they 're negotiating . in the company office . we 'll go up there and picket the place . 
and you 're gon na lose . and i 'm gon na get you - you betta run fast ! look out - i 'm coming in close . all right ? 
how ? 
<person> ? is he new here ? 
pictures do n't lie . 
i 'm not doing this until i speak with <person> . 
wednesday ... no , it 's tuesday , i think . 
it 's the least i could do . i heard shouting . 
what , nervous i 'm going to win ? 
i know ... i know ... it 's difficult for all of us . but sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gqod of the country . 
consumer recreation services . it 's their building . they ... 
i can do it , <person> -- you know that . in the bible stories you read to us , everybody 's always goin ' on a long journey . <person> goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he do n't even know where he lives , but he finds him . everybody finds what they supposed to find . 
i do n't know a thing about him , but is n't he the <number> you 're always yelling about ? 
i was missing you . 
a < u > gasket < /u > ? reed , we 're at a party . 
will it lower the curve ? 
yeah . security . 
i ca n't afford stuff like this right now . 
he sleepwalks , you idiot ! he 's fully capable of walking out of this hospital . oh my god ... he thinks i 've gone home ... 
i 'm jp monroe , you stupid little bitch . now get the fuck out of my life . 
if you do n't know her that well what makes you think she 's capable of murder ? 
i think so , thank you so much ... 
i thought you 'd missed the train . 
hey , nobody enters the command center without a power coin ! 
bombers . 
well that was our mistake then . and then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from woolworth 's . i do n't know if it 's the <number> branch or all of 'em . 
and <person> ? 
well , you know ... <person> told me before that you were drugged up . 
yeah . 
i 've got another one . warmer . what will you do when it 's all over ? 
i do n't think so . just period , i think . she told him ... god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of . <person> has an entire book -- a notebook . on every page it says `` <person> <person> <number> verse number <number> . '' he wrote that a few years ago after he 'd learned to write . his father 's name was franklin . 
oh . anything else ? 
please . it must have flown here -- 
oh , he did . 
bravo ! <person> ! our chairs are indeed almost touching ! and we want to remain seated on them , correct ? we do n't want them snatched from under us , am i right ? because if <number> goes , the other goes , and then - boom ! boom ! and we are both down before our time , you see ? and neither of us wants that , do you agree ? 
oh . well actually , i 'd just as soon find it myself . i just have the toothbrush to carry up and i think i can manage it myself . 
i 'm fine . 
yeah . and i thought everyone liked <person> . 
listen , <person> . i 'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here ... i thought i 'd go out with the extraction team tonight . unless you have an objection . 
logic indicates that is the case . 
all fashionably without heads . 
<person> <person> ... now that we can see the lake , i think we should follow the shoreline to -- 
no physical evidence . we ca n't prove he did it . we probably ca n't even prove he touched you by now . 
i 'm crazy about you . by the way , your pin . 
the spork . i get it . you 're very clever . 
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life . 
upset . no . i never get upset about business . 
madrid has just blacked out ! ! nothing more coming through . 
where will he go ? 
its about tonight . 
just have n't been this close to toontown for awhile . 
regardless of what you think , lieutenant , the fact remains that <person> is missing and that we must find him . 
no . you 're a wreck . 
i got lured . 
right . 
all right , thanks . now , let 's see . <person> will i start ? hey pal , how would you start ? 
did n't seem to me like that 's what was going on . you were all over her . 
just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet , and we 'll get along fine . 
about <person> ? no worries , man . i 'll call him . he 's a reasonable dude ... 
a < u > few < /u > ? 
wonder why he does n't fly both ways . 
do you remember what triggered it all ? 
<person> ' my partner . i 'm headin ' north up around the niobrara in nebraska . <person> na kill a couple of no good cowboys . 
no , you listen . we 're partners now and even though i 'm running the show for you , i 'm still running the show . that means i get a little respect . so i do n't want to hear anymore of this scooter , <person> , <person> , skippy , <person> , bullshit . it 's <person> . and i got ta tell you , for a guy who spends all his time in a gym , you could be in better shape . 
why ? what has happened ? 
much too young . 
... gruber 's not bad . 
by her own hand . there are many such stories . 
he mentioned a name , at the very end . `` <person> ... '' any followup on her ? 
some people said that . i never thought so . 
she did n't . she just left . 
no . well all right . but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right . 
<person> zero is a crackpot theory . you said so .

and me coming in with <number> pair -- 
these are exciting times , <person> . we 're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs . look at edward jenner . he was n't content to bleed people with leeches , he pioneered a new frontier of thought 
art . well what do you want to know about it . 
that 's your way , not mine . 
-- because there 'll be no remorse . not in my world . 
okay ... you 're not gon na like this but , well , it looks like anastasia is ... still alive .

maybe there 's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place , ever think of that ? 
so i 'm told . 
something you can feed the pets , perhaps ? let 's have it .

is he handsome , self assured , carry himself well , does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor , does he have good bones , suggesting good breeding , does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions , as they reveal a great deal about this man 's character so please get over yourself for <number> and a half seconds and tell me is he cute ?

some people do it for the fashion 
okey-dokey . 
from up close or far away ?

most vividly . `` st. <person> <person> , '' `` <person> <person> <person> , '' `` <person> <person> <person> <person> ... '' ... then <person> laid some `` <person> <person> <person> '' on me , and left me in the dust like a whipped dog . 
she 's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all . oh , i got rid of her , <person> , i did n't waste no time kickin ' that bitch out . <person> , she was screwin ' everybody in savannah . i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin ' piss out of him !

a channel . it 's just a little further down the dial , that 's all . <person> , it 's publicity . <person> 's publicity . <person> ? 
that 's for sure . now , i just need , on these last , these financing documents you sent us , i ca n't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here , so i -

i know . but if it is a trap then why are we going ? 
you coulda told me what you were doing . 
i 've made so many mistakes , <person> . we all put off the very last duties of our lives because we 're afraid of admitting when our lives are over . 
to hire someone solely on their ethnicity , gender or religion is not right . it 's un-american . i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job . 
i 'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not . to me . 
we 'll match your rate just prior to your ... accident . <number> half in advance . 
quit kidding . you did that vulcanizing job on <person> <person> - and we know it . 
i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling . 
for you , she is beautiful . for me , there is only my wife ! 
i mean , you 're kind of cut off , are n't you ? 
whatever our name is .

how long ? 
<person> vig . <person> <person> for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn , who 's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory . 
not really . it 's completely inert . no sound or energy sources have been detected . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill 
should n't take it personally . 
he 's sorry , <person> , he 's sorry . everything ... that makes everything all right . he 's sorry , everything 's ...

i ca n't really . yeah , no . i mean . i ca n't afford it . 
for your own amusement ? 
he would n't say that . what he would say is `` <person> , you ca n't afford to live in a cheap hotel . does n't the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you ? do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all ? phooey , <person> ! '' 
leave it in the front of your house for me , okay ? 
yeah . 
you do n't know what he thinks . 
yes , but do n't take any chances . 
do n't worry , major . your rights will be fully protected . 
yeah , a little bit . <person> , this is important . when you feel it start to give , put the clutch in . 
some people do it for the money 
you were paid to take me out ! by -- the <number> person i truly hate . i knew it was a set-up ! 
what 'd he say ?

<person> could save us an awful lot of time . 
why ? 
you 're nuts .

i thought i would ask you a few questions if that 's okay . 
i do n't know , <person> ' . wadda you feel like doing ?

what 's average ? 
thank you , your honor . <person> : ms. costello is a rebuttal witness . as a 'surprise <person> ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here . 
i know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones . 
i 'm utterly satisfied .

whoa , whoa , whoa . i said i 'd drop you home , but i 'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds . i 've already pulled twelve hours today . 
no , hallie , not tonight . parties and mass murderers do n't go together . trust me . 
macaulay , you drew up wynant 's will . <person> was cut off , was n't she , if she re-married ? 
can we talk about this ? can you just try to calm down ? 
it does . 
there 's just <number> more thing i need you to do . 
no . 
yes , do you think that 's why he looks so sad ? 
no , i never saw him before in my life . 
yeah , this is <person> . 
do i not please you , <person> ? 
that 's how we met . we 're members of the international same name club . believe it or not , there are <number> <person> <person> in america . but only <number> in the new york metropolitan area . that 's how <person> and i got to be such good friends . we 're the only ones who show up at the meetings . 
she has pretty red hair ... she is very kind i think . 
we 're half a <number> off . 
what ? 
a young patriot ? -- who recites <person> and <person> ? -- turned loose in our nation 's capital ? i think i can . 
... the pet wrangler suggested it..he 's also got a ... 
yes ? 
not ... complaining , actually . 
he bled a bunch , but no , there was no peeing . 
what d'you say , <person> ? 
army life is too dang easy , my feet have gone soft . back home , we go out squirrel huntin ' , i walk forever and a day and then some , do n't even raise a blister . 
exactly what i mean . it 's all ruined . 
there 's more to it than trying to see if you 'd steal from the company or if you 'd lie or cheat . 
twelve . 
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards . my own wife included . 
what about <person> ? 
if we 're going to virginia , why do n't we drop by fort knox ? i can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the god damn cia . 
that 's very linear sheriff . 
he did ? 
no . 
thomas . he told me it was a very nice place . 
not far from it ... 
when ? 
no buts . i 've waited twenty-seven years , twenty-seven years i have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle . i will not be derailed ! i will not be embarrassed ! i will not be denied ! i am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water ! 
i know this is a very personal subject , but could you be a little more specific ? 
why not , lad ? absolute justice ? 
simone does not control my destiny . 
you always talk like this ? you 're not gon na start chanting or anything are you ? 
oh - nothing . no extra charge . 
where do you find the time ? where do you find the energy . it 's tough enough to keep your mind on school . a woman here is a real pain in the ... 
he did n't mention the money . what he said on the phone is n't important , is it ? he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother , and he did n't ! that 's what i want you to do something about ! 
so she 's uh , flourishing ? 
you . 
they may nail me into this now , mccoy . 
when you exit , head east on <number> . 
please ? 
i guess it is <number> forty-two . 
nothing . i never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer i knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... but you wear it well . 
sure do ... my mom 's from canada 
i wish i could help you . 
boys , we was chained together . i hadda tell ya somethin ' . <person> ' out alone was not a option ! 
alright , i 'll try ... `` cocksucker '' . that 's what she calls me . 
they do n't know . <person> said this is the worst crime they 've ever seen . even worse than ... well it 's bad . they 're bringing in the feds . this is big . 
it 's a common medical term . 
i will . 
just be natural , goddamit . 
go back to the hotel . 
richie , take the keys . start that big bastard up , and drive it up front . 
food does n't agree with me . 
well , most guys i know who work in mergers and acquisitions do n't really like it . 
i like the sound of that . 
oh . oh , my . 
this is my doing . this is my arrogance ... my vanity ... 
which leads us to ... 
the , uh , blur there . 
must be ... 
how did he sound this time ? was he nervous ? depressed ? 
are you kidding ? ... i 've got so much on <person> , it is n't funny . 
she went . 
do n't worry about it . you 're my guest . 
how about squeezing him through into dartmouth ? if all he wants to do is catch lobsters , he can learn that here . 
no , i would n't . 
... of the procedures ... 
< u > you ? < /u > spock , that 's extraordinary . 
all right . it 's a beginning . <person> <person> , nevada . 
come on . just tell me . it 'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms . 
oh . uh-huh . 
you know , in this light , and with that expression on your face , you look about twenty-five years old . 
the place is crawling with hoovers . 
i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes . i helped him to say yes . <person> . you 're not a robot , <person> ! that 's all . you got a mind of your own , do n't you ? 
you go first . 
<number> time i was flying supplies up the amazon . went down in the jungle ... . 
shut up , cunt ! do exactly as i say , or i 'll put this arrow through your throat . 
never won a race . but it got me in with the trainer . we 'd have a thing , i do n't remember , some fucking thing . the jockey would raise his whip , it meant the fix was in , we 'd all go running . people get greedy . first they bet small , they keep their mouth shut . within a month 's time , everyone and their brother was in on it . the odds would drop , i mean you could watch the goddamn board . it looked like a fuckin stopwatch , the odds would drop so fast . 
how 'd they know who you were ? 
i am , as a matter of fact . 
nick the greek . 
..and as lonely as i am ... 
no , no payment . i have given it back . i do n't want it . 
- but now it deposits you here . 
it 's impossible . i was buying or selling something . i 've been to cairo many times . 
this is my house . 
it 's a pretty common place to look for food when you do n't think you have any . 
well . we 've spent weekends before with nobody talking ... ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects ... 
if you can catch him . 
<person> singer over here ! 
yes ... that 's the first thing <person> asked too . 
i want my pain to go 'way , <person> -- make it go 'way , please <person> -- -- please ... 
it 's very expensive . 
i want to stand for what i believe in , father . 
back up ! back ... 
did you invite them ? 
it 's you who invoked the parlay ! believe me , miss , you 'd best hand it over , now ... or these be the last friendly words you 'll hear ! 
yes . 
come on . <person> . do n't do this . he 's <number> of my students , for christ sake . i 'm not even sure if he 's -- 
and i suppose you do n't feel bad ! 
<number> <number> years old . 
then how are you involved ? 
which way did she go ? 
he 's already got ta be a part of <person> 's life . what do you know about this derek ? 
mind if i come in ? 
about <person> ? <person> ? 
then why especially does it have to be in german ? 
very well . 
find out is there < u > any < /u > chance we can get some rain tomorrow , < u > will < /u > you ... ? 
shoot , italian boys love them some black women . they ca n't get enough of me . 
and ... uh- 
no , i 've never played anything cool in my entire life . <person> , who i 'll stab to death later , never gave me the message . 
what do you mean ? 
i dress up when i want to make an impression . - so how 'd it go ? 
the water 's going putrid in the barrels . 
that 's exactly right , <person> . so the question as i see it is n't `` why should you work for n.s.a . '' it 's `` why should n't you ? '' 
hey , you did n't happen to lock the truck up when you got out ... 
hmmm . 
yes it is . can we please not do that ? please ? cause it is . 
not that i can see . we 'll know more once i get the lab reports back from seattle . 
if you remember , sir , my test scores were in the top -- 
well , <person> damn it , <person> -- <person> 's mom does n't work eighteen-hour days , and <person> 's dad did n't leave her , so figuring out who 's gon na take who where is a little easier over at randy 's house . 
i like you , dil 
a <number> bucks . in the last <number> months . 
you think so , eh ? <person> comes first , l or ... <person> ? 
<number> of <number> things will happen . we 're either going to get <person> <person> , or he 'll finish his series of <number> , and this case will go on for years . 
we 've got to , <person> , everyone 's watching . 
what ? 
no . i got it in prison . i went in for <number> years . when i came out she was married to my best friend . <person> ? 
you know what i want . 
why am i being lectured in this way ? ! 
yes . 
i take it you learnt to live with yours then . take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being ... 
this your store ? 
ohh no , it makes my skin creep ! 
yes , sir . do you want the other cauliflower ? 
me too . 
they left an hour ago , pink nuts . 
sometimes i think he is fooling us with that crazy business . 
shit ! 
yeah , thanks a lot . 
thanks . nice meeting you . 
where 's you get it ? 
you could n't get to him ? 
but we do n't want to be greedy now , so let 's let him have it at $ <number> . 
now you know what to watch for ... 
no , <person> <person> . 
now do n't do that . do n't you do that ! do n't infect him with the idea that it 's okay to quit . that it 's okay to be a failure , because it 's not okay ! if you 're angry at me for being successful , for being what you could have been -- 
what is your rank within <person> <person> ? 
i ca n't wait to see the pictures . 
he 's a liar . but that 's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- i still love him . 
<person> jour . 
but suppose for a second you did . 
are n't you going to say , 'i told you so ' ? 
what ? 
thank you , <person> . that 'll be all for tonight . 
what about you ? 
maybe we should bail ? 
enjoyed it ? 
going for a pony ride at kiddielands , want to come along ? 
yes , well ... 
chief , sometimes i do n't know whether you 're kidding or not . 
it was the plo . 
would they notice and eighty-eight ? 
how did you get your hand out ? 
there . 
look , it 's my ass facin ' the penitentiary . you send some hard- headed roc whore , and she fucks things up . 
come with me . i 'll explain on the way . 
it 's too clean . 
did he ? 
small talk . try the weather . 
if he could -- 
no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away . 
then , why did you come ? 
i 'm looking for you , actually . 
but he had to dump the body there to make the move . 
we never really shared <number> . 
yes . they 're free . 
i did . that stuff i gave him was counterfeit . they 'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it . 
what ? how did you know i had a cat ? 
<person> ? when did i say ... ? 
facing north ... i 'd hate to commit myself without my compass ... pardon me ... are you an explorer ? 
<person> , i 'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let 's just say what it is . when you first came here , i did n't like you and i was worried . <person> means a lot to me and this family . do n't go looking here for whatever you looking for . do n't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time . 
her prints belong to <person> <person> , convicted for soliciting <number> years ago . 
got a letter from your wife . she writes pretty regular , tells me the family news . 
you 're frightened , are n't you , norman ? 
nothing . i 'm in third grade . what 's a revolutionary what ch'a ma ' callit ? 
why am i out of order ? 
i deserve a lot more than that truck ! <number> years , <number> years i busted my ass for that fat rat bastard . 
you -- you are n't going to have any friends left , if you do n't watch out . 
we need an exit . 
we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house . 
you heard me the first time ! 
no , you see , i do n't really love him . 
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with . 
`` guessing '' is not in my nature ... 
you do -- 
it has nothing to do with him . 
i can see that you 're still very bitter about us , but in the interest of science , i 'm going to give it my best shot . let 's go to work , boys . 
depends if my date wants to stop by . 
it 's a sign . he 's come home . 
how the hell 'd you get the beans all the way up top like that ? 
i got beat . we 're only alive because i knew something about these ships that he did n't . 
i have been to the dark side . i have seen a world that no man should ever see . 
where ? 
same place we are . 
i guess it proves you really care about me . you hung in there . 
try sitting down . 
that do n't make no sense ! 
not me , sonny . i 'm just going to sit around and listen . what 's this ? 
romeo ? -- he gave it to henslowe . 
oh , yeah ? thanks . how long do they say i 'm in here ? 
you 'd deny a dying man his salvation ? 
not you . him . 
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints ? 
i 'll explain it tomorrow ! 
most we 've ever used is half a cc . 
want to take it back ? 
why ? 
you 're too good to me . 
not exactly . but it 's his kind of neighborhood . 
in that case , i suppose we ca n't charge . 
<person> whale . this afternoon at the party . 
mph rmph rmph rmph rm ! ! ! 
it 's a growth business . 
saunders -- 
to live in . there 's a lot of us ... beyond the valley . 
we put him to bed for the night . 
what 're you talkin ' about ? 
nothing . 
a <number> years ... it 's a toast . 
i 'm a little short . i 'll catch you next time . 
never to pretend to know more than i did . 
what we just did , you askin ' for money , make a man stop . i ai n't callin ' you no ho . but i ai n't gon na be played like no trick , neither . remember ... you called me . 
so <number> day we 'll meet . 
told by whom ? 
lay off , <person> . i 'm not in the mood . 
motherhood . 
mom , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late . 
first you and me got ta get a couple things straight . 
aye -- i know , <person> -- and i have never loved anyone more . 
give me the gun . 
i loved it . 
he really loves you . come back to peking with me . we 'll find a solution . 
look he 's a mixer and a trouble maker ! 
why do n't you help us ? 
i 'll bet you can . sit . 
here 's the best part . we can charge five-hundred a pound . 
it 's okay . 
and what do you want out of this ? 
they were vampires , were n't they ? 
that 's ok . 
why not ? 
well , uh , <person> and i have an early plane . we were hoping to get back to new york in time for ... 
i think i will pass ... 
i just want to know what he looks like , is all . 
i do n't know . the truth , maybe . 
i have to say that i 'm not there yet . 
it 's in the stars . 
you forgot your keys ! 
there 's a better place ... 
please , <person> . this is not easy for me . our father took a < u > long < /u > time to die . a long time . it just about killed us all . and <person> and i made a pact that when our time came - we would n't let it drag out . 
i do n't know . 
just a little accident . i went by your place , picked up your mall . just bills , i 'll take care of them . 
nothing ... i just immerse you in water ... 
i 'll see you ... soon . 
do it ? 
soon . we 're going to <person> , <person> to see my cousin <person> married . <person> loves in there . 
hello . 
i could 've helped you . we coulda made a deal with <person> . if you 'd listen ... 
yes , they are . you 're out of shape . 
victoria ? she 's okay . 
< u > you < /u > said that . that was < u > your < /u > testimony . 
i say we go . 
okay . do n't worry about it . it 's okay . 
how about chargin ' the battery ? 
let 's go . 
invisible ! 
but ai n't no reason -- 
take your car . 
oh , it 's real selective ... about as hard to get a hold of as the manhattan phone book . 
close the law book . 
you 're doing fine . 
when did we get that ? 
yes . 
better than playing with yourself . 
because it seemed stupid and foolish . 
do n't know what ? 
where is he now ? 
it 's certainly ... dramatic . 
i hurt you ? 
horror flicks . b-movies from <person> 's heyday . 
i do n't care . 
not yet . 
now i 've got another lie to live down . thanks , <person> . 
come on , <person> . we 're on the verge of something huge . let 's consider the possibility , just the <number> of us , alone in this room . what if <person> was right . i mean , what if ? and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates . when it got to the museum , it hatched . 
even if i got there first she would n't go with me . 
you are personally responsible . if i can get conjugal rights , will you visit me at sing sing ? 
i 'm going to take <person> for a walk . 
yes . 
that 's because he is . does that upset you ? 
you 're strong enough . but you 're going to need courage , <person> . 
contaminated substance . very dangerous . shooting mud . 
i 'm not ! i 'm just trying to get some facts . 
well , i was n't sure whether he was parroting me because that 's all he was capable of , or whether he sensed that that 's all i wanted to hear , and he was trying to please me . 
i got him . 
yes . 
i 'd ignore her . people can change , <person> . 
# <number> . way behind schedule . it 's top- secret , but everybody knows it 's a digital broadcast space . they see the dishes on top , the fiber optics going in . 
is there ? 
you 're on the grift . same as me . 
i 'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here . 
maybe he just could n't pull the trigger ... 
what about mrs. <person> and ... ? 
answer the phone . 
yes . <person> <person> . 
no . no , it all depends on what offers i get . 
<person> egyptian trick . you 'll see . 
how ? 
for him , not for the law ! i 'm surprised at you , <person> . <person> , i gave you credit for more brains than <person> . 
oh no , <person> <person> . no . no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment . 
do n't tell me what to do , just give me his head on a platter ! 
just get the fuck outta here . 
exactly . <number> -- 
shoot , i appreciate that man . 
that 's what i mean ... <number> , <person> . 
oh , <person> -- 
i do n't trust anyone . that 's what comes of working in television . 
god damn it , i knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit . 
no need to call me doctor . i 'm a therapist , not a psychiatrist . 
you know why , right ? 
but those notations stop ... ... four-and-one-half minutes after <person> <person> <person> 's ... 
hello , <person> . 
will you quit gabbin ' and do what you 're told . 
i 'll see you around . 
take it easy . the glass is bullet resistant . 
i 'm not sure i do , archie . 
how many men you killed ? ai n't you gon na answer ? 
we all know what happened . in a fit of jealous rage you killed <person> and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you . 
now i do . back then , was a different story . 
have i ? i 'm trying all the time . 
you 're right , son . you must care the links with your family , always . it 's the only important thing in the world . 
duh . what else would i be talking about ? now stop askin ' stupid doorknob questions . well , a year and a half ago , this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour . he snagged this coke . but , he 's a good cop with a wife and a kid , so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust . 
rita . pass the wine . 
if he 's not there , try ... <number> - <number> - <number> . 
and that 's the job ? nothing about serving your country ? 
yes , sir . 
the roller disco <number> . 
can you change something this big ? 
<person> <person> said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life , and meditated a separation , in which case , she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance , and subject them , at any rate , to a doubtful and expensive litigation . they were quite insistent on this point , and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital . 
... to fort mcgruder in his truck . 
it 's <person> <person> 's birthday . 
ai n't nobody goin ' to neither , long as <person> <person> 's around . 
he 's staying at the hotel i 've gone to with , uh , with the lady in question . must 've seen us . 
it was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact . <person> <person> came to represent every killer <person> <person> had not caught . the idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine . for someone like <person> , there would always be a suspect zero . we could n't let <person> go where that idea was taking him . 
i figured that much . why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for ? 
i have to go . 
oh -- you would ! 
no , c'mon , i wan na know . i wan na keep score . 
you have such a great personality , <person> . you should open your own charm school . 
who engineered this getaway ? 
that 's me . 
i 'd love to . 
why do n't you reset and run it again . the pods check out ok . 
ok. for <number> thing , we 're gon na need to turn that music down so we can talk , ok ? 
that we 're going back . i do n't want it to end . i do n't want to be what i was when i left . 
i was here <number> years . and i only hated <number> . 
downstairs , i know . <person> 's terror ordeal : page <number> . 
you said he was behind an extortion scheme . 
yeah , i remember the girl who was in it with me . she was something . 
i do n't anymore . 
ai n't it just ? the man who invented beer , <person> , that man was having a prime day for himself . 
take it , easy , boy ... seems to me you 're different than a lotta boys that come to me . most of 'em seem troubled , confused , but i 'd say you knew exactly what you want . 
i 'm sorry . i do n't mean to take out my frustration on you . you 've been a great help to me , and i 've let you down . 
of course not , they 're closed . <person> <person> 's place . he 'll do it for me . 
he said he thought we 'd make a pretty good team . 
yes , it 's been several hours since we 've eaten . i did n't realize that so much time had past , did you , <person> <person> ? 
yeah , i guess so . what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other . why do n't they try liking each other once in a while ? 
keep your voice down . 
something i ate . 
hello , <person> . <person> 's business at the blue parrot ? 
shut up , you slut . you think you can take him from me ? well , over my dead body . 
you ' new here , man ! see you , boys . 
socially ... i 'll have a beer . 
that 's impressive . how did you do that ? 
maybe he just figures <person> will appreciate what he 's created . it 's the dark end of the street , <person> . how do you like it now ? 
i-you know , i do n't wan na . 
i ca n't take it anymore . i 've got to call evelyn . 
yup . so darn lucky . i wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan , and a cop pension i ca n't live off of . good thing i was n't any luckier . <person> ! another shooter right here ! 
sure . that 's <number> of my numbers . it 's how many months old my little girl is . 
you do n't want to . 
yeah , ok . i found the first licorice comfits album at vintage vinyl . the one on testament of youth . <person> released here . japanese import only . 
i do n't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night , you are through with that play ! is that clear ? is that clear ! 
teresa banks . 
a dollar on the <number> , <number> on the <number> . 
he said he could n't take us any farther . he has to go sell the elephants . 
like , that there 's a point ? an organic connection between all living things . 
i can reconfigure the scan for c-12 , amylase proteins . 
barton . <person> requires ... understanding . 
oh come off it , <person> . what about what's-his-name ... <person> ? you could 've at least passed the baton on that <number> . 
this clear layer in glycerin . we 'll mix it back in when we make the soap . 
well , maybe i will . you sure you do n't want anything ? 
dorothy ! you ca n't sleep here ! you ca n't sleep in the middle of a field ! 
just come down , <person> . just -- 
i was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask . 
you 'll know it when you see it ... tis a splendid sight , all covered with gold ... do n't fear making noise . dragons be deaf as tree stumps . 
it was my fault , t.j. fuck ! 
i know , but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the senate ? 
you 're part of this , are n't you ? ! 
tch . you are so sweet ... now i know why you 're saying this . ... you 're afraid i 'm in danger and you 're trying to protect me . 
a gun 's a gun man . it do n't need to be loaded . 
yeah , we 'd have to fly you out for meetings , you know . 
i do n't believe it ! i ca n't believe it . she 's lying . you 're lying . you 're lying ! every word you 've been saying is a lie ! come on , say it ! 
look lady , i do n't have time for games . <person> put the ... . 
<person> , i 'm calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry . but -- i need your permission to fire him . 
what will you say about us ? 
all right , we 'll take <person> with us -- 
now you are upsetting my fowl . please go . 
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on , the waste - i 'd been taught to re-use everything , the dung from a cow to cool a radiator , a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a <number> years on what i saw thrown away . 
here he comes right now . 
i know . 
we all , had to look at the body . it was awful , <person> -- awful ! 
yes ma'am , i do . 
then why did you chose to < u > inform < /u > me of it ... ? 
no , look . it 's the others . they 're the ones causing these delays . 
here , put my jacket over you . 
everybody 's too stupid ! 
norman , you are so funny about that . no , i did n't . 
i want it -- 
oh . 
catch him and your record 's clean . 
that 's right , <person> . and we 're getting married when we return . 
you could n't understand ! <person> , <person> <person> , i 'll be on my way to washington in half an hour . whatever happens , i 'm all ready for this ranger of yours . never mind how . you 'll get your instructions from <person> <person> here . it is n't anything you have to do . i would n't trust you to lick a stamp . <person> 'll do it himself . you just use your *high office* to help him get it done . understand ? 
remember , <person> , not a word to anyone . 
if i was n't , this would n't work . now once i deliver i 'll have to trust you . 
not for long , you ai n't . 
how about me getting the help . she 's quiet now , is n't she ? 
what 's the matter ? did you <number> have a fight ? . 
oh , and god , <person> , i did ... this really terrible thing to him . because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice . 
we ca n't go anywhere until i get to a phone . 
he missed <number> weeks . 
sweeney . 
as a matter of fact , i do . look at their eyes . they 're obviously nocturnal . come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt . so our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode <number> . ' 
me , i 'm proud to be a jew , i got no problem . you do n't like it , fuck you . but with these guys it 's like a dirty word . all they wan na be is good red- white-and-blue americans , and the way they see it you ca n't be a good american and a jew . so <person> <person> becomes <person> <person> and <person> <person> becomes <person> 0 . <person> -- like anyone 's gon na think he 's irish for fuck 's sake -- 
are you all right ? 
i do n't wan na work at all . 
no . 
ok .

oh . you know him . 
taylor 's dead . 
i guess you 've seen some bad things . 
clark . he 's late again . i ca n't figure him out . 
who ? 
and whose houses do you design ... ? 
that is a boy from home , <person> 's brother . 
so i heard . congratulations . it 's the most important step in a woman 's life , is n't it ? 
i traveled <number> <number> miles . what about your united nations ? 
i 've shown it so many times i know it by heart . the first time i showed it , in <number> , was the sunday my first wife died . they kept it hidden from me all day so they would n't have to close down the movie house . i only found out that night , after the last show . those are things you never forget ... so , <person> , how are these home movies going ? 
lena ? 
debbie , i 'm telling you , i did n't do anything , hardly . 
well , i changed the ending a little . 
<person> , <person> , here you go . 
the death of <person> <person> was a great loss . to us all ... 
were you or were you not working in the watchdog office over the weekend ? 
and so , on this , the most solemn day of the jewish year , a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that -- 
peck ! <person> ! douse the fire ! 
that 's in <number> days . 
well , are you ? 
i 'll find you a priest . 
do n't worry . you wo n't see him again . what happened ? did you change your mind about going ? 
i do n't want to leave the convent , <person> . 
yeah , but it weighs better than thirty tons . no way they could stop it . 
is this my glory , sir ? 
his wife 's influence . 
shortie , look ! 
and this used to be your house , i bet . why do you want to scare everybody ? 
did you think i would n't ? 
last year <person> was in a.p . <person> . and <person> won the science fair . what are they doing in special needs ? 
would that impress you ? i mean you 're the kinda woman that probably has <person> written all over your personal ad . 
naw . 
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed ? 
before or after the explosion ? <person> -- 
oh yeah ? how 's he doing ? 
<person> <person> -- you 're about to meet <person> -- in hell ! 
suck my ass .

you wife is n't dead is she ?

i … her letter came to me by the nurse . 
loretta , shut it . 
hell you did . your turn . 
if you 'll follow me , professor -- 
no ! wait ! erik ! the cloak ! the cloak invisible ! it only seems to work on my father ! 
about that shooting last night ... i was there and ... 
jess , c'mon ... 
most articles focus on the first half of her name -- describing some feline monster . i want the woman of catwoman . after all , if it was a man dressed as a cat , the story would be on page <number> -- just another loony . oh , i want this one . i want her bad.. 
can you move the ice afterwards ? i do n't know nobody who can move ice . 
of course there is . look -- the veranda room -- right there . 
gotcha . 
ca n't it wait ? 
still , 'old friend . ' you 've managed to kill just about everyone else , but like a poor marksman , you keep missing the target . 
no . 
that 's good enough . 
i asked you to be nice to him . 
tell me . 
well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ? 
what do you mean ? it does n't get to look much better than that ? 
i know what you went through tonight . i kept thinking of what you said : that all good things died here , violently . 
you would do that , would n't you ? 
the only proof is those bodies . 
whatever . 
uh-huh . i 'll be right back . 
your concentrating too hard , killaine . what about <person> <person> ? she had a motive . i guess you know by this time whose gun it was ? 
i 'll have some of that . 
a fellow your age , hiring an airplane to write : 'hildy : do n't be hasty -- remember my dimple . walter. ! it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it . 
you do ? over here ? on < u > my < /u > side ? 
-- she 's not dead ! just have to get her heart pumping aqain ! 
boy , i thought <person> was a tough businessman , but somebody 's really taking him to the cleaners here . 
in the cellar . buried under a stone in the floor . 
i 'm tired of being a flag . i want to be a bull again . lets get out of here , <person> . <person> 's blow . 
speaking of <person> , there 's more good news : you wo n't even have to change your last name . you 'll always be mrs. peel . 
we ca n't wait . we all go together or not at all . 
you 're pissing me off again , <person> . 
he has a timer going as back-up , in case we got a hold of the remote . <person> ... first , run your fingers along the edges , feel for a sensor . 
oh . 
we are in a dungeon . how do we get out ? 
save us all a lot of trouble . 
she was the <number> -- 
oh , would you ... ? 
yet on november <number> , <number> - the day of the president 's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 magnum . but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill . here , take a look at it . now , does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you ? 
i 'd never try to sell an indian . 
thank you , <person> . 
soiled with dirt , foul ; sullen , hostile , forbidding -- as a black day . foully or outrageously wicked , as black cruelty . indicating disgrace , dishonor or culpability . 
you 're what ? 
because i saw the other people ! and they knew you were good ! you were good , goddamnit ! 
around <number> . 
<person> ? oysters ? 
did she talk ? 
eddie , how was i ? 
admiral , if we go by the book , like lieutenant saavik , hours could seem like days . 
and is that what you 're going to do ? is that what you 're going to do ... ? 
any particular kind ? 
do n't be silly . hi , <person> . 
right ... you 're the gatekeeper . but i want <person> . <person> , speak to me ... 
he did n't kill her . 
<person> ! you ca n't be serious ! 
i tell you , this station will be operational as planned . 
no , sweetie . cynicism is bullshit . 
i 'll see what i can do -- you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you 're going to be hurting for a while . 
of course it is ! that 's why i 'm telling you ! 
but an oracle can . 
um , yes . i have n't fought with them , since i started here . 
who gets it , the company ? 
how many of our class left ? you and me out of twenty-eight . 
i guess you could say i was n't thinkin ' , captain . 
i 'm sorry , <person> . 
i just mean it 's weird to me ... i 've never been anywhere near here in my life . 
i think so , daughter . how old are you ? 
ah - you 've heard that ? 
i 'm not filming . i 'm watching <person> die . it 's just like a move but realer . 
oh yes , and certainly _we_ will ! 
-- jeeeeeeesus -- 
i do n't think she 's talking much ... you know what i mean ? 
shut up ! 
you stay out of this , look , if i had a red xk-150 with a black interior , i sure as hell would n't be handing out relationship advice . 
i call myself phoebe . 
you have your passport ? 
me ? ! 
we gon na crash ? 
when did she die ... ? 
yes . 
you just had a good example of it . a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna . 
she 's okay . 
let 's take a look . 
i really do n't know . 
they will kill you . and then they will kill your wife , too . 
i ca n't save her . 
but there was an attack . i can still see them coming . there was a fight , was n't there ? 
perhaps i 'm old-fashioned . i know it was supposed to be very warm there , mitch , but ... well ... actually ... well , the newspaper said she was naked . 
i 'm never smiling again . <person> dragged me into the boys ' locker room to tell me ... 
they called here after you left ... 
who am i ? ? who are you , you schmucks , you ca n't even make a decent swastika ... . give me the paint . give it to me . 
well when can we do something ? 
we 're gon na spend half the night driving around the hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks , then we 're gon na look for this other party you heard about . but , <person> , all the parties and bars , they all suck . i spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who 's eyes are darting around to see if there 's someone else she should be talking to . and it 's like i 'm supposed to be all happy cause she 's wearing a backpack . half of them are nasty skanks who would n't be shit if they were n't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes . i 'm not gon na be <number> of those assholes . it 's fucking depressing . some skank who is n't half the woman my girlfriend is is gon na front me ? it makes me want to puke . 
we , yes . yes . they , they present their side , and i get the same chance . to cross-examine ... to ... to ... 
stop blaming yourself . 
i wish i were . but if i were , what would i want with you ? 
is it bad ? 
looks that way , son . guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there 's <number> left out here -- we got ta find him . 
<person> metel . the devil 's trumpet . do n't worry . i ai n't goin ' religioso again . it 's a flower that grows on these islands . where i come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a mickey finn . it 's toxic . ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it ... or ... in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system . 
fairbanks is a three-hour flight . i 'll be back by dinnertime . 
who did you bribe for your visa ? <person> or yourself ? 
what ? 
relax . you 'll see it all later . 
i do n't know . i just feel it . 
does n't matter . whatever he wanted he did n't get it . we 've got no need staying around here . it 's light enough . let 's pack up and head out . 
you 're a little ahead of yourself -- the usual routine would be for you to propose , and if i accept , then you 'd give me an engagement ring -- 
you do n't want to know , believe me . but do n't worry , i washed my hands ... 
such as ? 
hi . oh , hi . hi . 
to bed with you , c'mon . 
in any case , you 've got to recover chimera and bring it to us . 
oh , no , <person> . they 've only just begun ... 
why did n't you notify the police ? 
nothing . but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her . 
pat , i 'm not kidding . i really think it 's the greatest -- 
okay . <person> . where the hell is that ? 
or once . 
before i get off work . 
<number> should do it . 
you do n't think i 'm kissin ' his ass , do you ? 
from what i can see you 're a pretty fair wheelman . there 's a hairpin coming up -- that 's the place for it . the cops 'll plow right into you . 
yeah ! 
he 's the best painter in the world . i 'm gon na give him <number> of these . 
especially with an election coming up in a few days . 
yes sir . 
i do n't know . <number> or <number> minutes , tops . 
this place is an untapped resource . check it out , dude , these vocal jazz girls are < u > hot < /u > . 
yes ? 
the serial killer ? 
i did n't know <person> had a beach house . 
she 's blaming herself for sheila . i know how it feels . i 've been thinking about <person> . maybe i could 've stopped it , if i 'd listened . 
what are you afraid of ? what people think ? 
seems like you told me about a promise you made -- 
not true . 
he says on the photo he 'll call tomorrow at eleven . why not come back then and listen for yourself . 
what 's too late about it ? look , we 're not dead , are we ? that 's the only thing that 's too late . 
oh no . you ’ ll have to do better than that , mr lombard . 
oh , really ? 
-- and you wan na know the common element for the entire group , like he asks ... i 'll tell you the answer : i 'll tell you , 'cause i had that question . i had that same question ... .carbon . in pencil led , it 's in the form of graphite and in coal , it 's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it 's in hard form . `` well ... all we were asking was the common element , <person> ... but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge ... ahhh , <person> ! full of useless thoughts , eh ? '' thank you . thank you . and the book says : `` we may be through with the past but the past is not through with us . '' and no it 's not dangerous to do that . 
<number> days . 
no . 
it 's not me , <person> . i swear . it ca n't be . 
and ours . it 's our grandchild . 
nah , not now -- all those hard-ons around . i 'll wait . not now . 
huh ? 
hair on her hand . plus jen- nifer had raven black hair . 
hell if i know , crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas . 
the television said they 've started with the looting already . vultures . 
no . i 'm not . 
what an asshole . 
detonation in twenty minutes . 
i guess it was <number> , <number> . 
you ... you found that at leon ’ s ? 
we 're going somewhere . after . and no . i did n't ask your father . 
... time , royal succession , regicide , bribery ... 
they tried to kill you ? 
<person> ' , <person> ... 
oh , he 's coming , he got something real special this year . 
well , we laughed . we laughed all the time . 
are you disappointed ? 
that is my least vulnerable spot . 
that 's a nice name . 
no . that sounds more important . let 's forget about tonight . 
mother , for petesakes . 
how would you do that , <person> <person> ? 
i 'm sure you 'd be great in <person> <person> . but , you know -- this writer 's pretty damn good too . 
will you wait for me ? 
a couple of weeks back . 
i 'll take my chances with <person> . 
well , i 've been moody and dissatisfied . 
sure . 
i know . i know . they 'll say anything . 
alright , get in the car before i have to embarrass you in front of your friend . 
you mean <person> von gaigern ? 
okay , sweetie . 
<person> , you leave it up these people ... ! 
why ? am i making you hot , or does the truth scare you ? 
if nature gives a man a collector 's mind , it does n't matter what he collects . butterflies . <person> <person> . <person> farthings . a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass . 
<person> <person> . <person> ? i did lousy at school . 
woody ! 
that guy treats women like objects , man . 
'it 's booty time , it 's booty time , across the u.s.a . it 's booty time ... ' 
no , somebody powerful . oh . look . what 's that up there ? 
no . have you seen my glasses ? 
goodbye . 
point is , listen to them . they 've lost faith in old symbols . they 're ready to bond with you , the icon of the future . if it works , do n't fix it ... 
she was very badly raped , you see . we were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house , in this very room you 're sitting in now . i was left a helpless cripple . the doctors said it was pneumonia , because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic . the doctors told me it was pneumonia , but i knew what it was . a victim of the modern age , poor , poor girl . suddenly his mood changes . he wheels right up to <person> . 
awful sorry i betrayed you fellas ; must be my hogwallop blood . 
better than not getting a job ? 
excuse me . 
a man has to choose what he will be . i believe that . 
okay . 
not for me . 
we 'll send you the release forms , ted . our staffers will help in any way they can . 
where are you going ? 
i do n't fuck my partners . 
really ? you told your father what you told me ? you let him see your passion for acting ? 
rwanda-burundi . <person> <person> . 
hey , that 's great , <person> ! good thinking ! 
what are you wearing ? i mean , we should wear suits . 
if you 're in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <number> . 
do you mind if i use your bathroom ? 
absolutely not . 
something like that . 
do you mind if i check upstairs ? 
do n't call her mother all the time . it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving . what happened to <person> ? 
of course you should . c'mon , i 'm already a <number> hours late . 
but your voice have they dropped ? 
what 's that ? 
okay , stand by in operations . let 's go . 
c'mon . what 're ya tryin ' to be ? the phantom lady ? 
<person> asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ? 
theo , did you see the animal ? 
hey , you dealt us this hand , we 're playing it all the way . <person> . 
the charge is murder . 
that 's good , i 've never seen anything so healthy . 
i though we went over this . 
no . 
now , <person> , a body ca n't help their feelin 's . 
wrong color . it 's silver . it 's not easy living up to this . 
dan'l webster ? 
where is she ? 
yes , you can get carrot juice or italian coffee , and the people there -- well , none of them quite fit in . you 'd love it -- why do n't you come there with me -- they 're having a marathon poetry reading on new year 's eve . i go every year . 
you have n't eaten your lunch . 
<person> ! 
what the hey . let 's go for a drive . 
what about her ? let 's c ut up the money , i want to get north . 
phooey on that . 
let 'er go , <person> ! 
how do you know i 'm not ? 
they 're anxiety attacks ? that 's a little disappointing . 
did you hear what i said ? come inside ... . 
who sought the warrant ? 
... we 're the bait . 
you mean < u > with white < /u > ... ? 
no , that son-of-a-bitch walker is alive . 
men like you do n't need orders . 
if you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little ... we 'll be here . 
boys like him have -- expectations . 
stens ? was it <person> ? 
that 's rather nice , is n't it ? 
why of course -- 
but recent events have been so dramatic , it does raise the perennial question . what keeps us watching this <number> man twenty-four hours a day - eating , sleeping , working , sitting for hours in contemplation ? 
it can wait . anything else ? 
i can not tell you a goddamned lie . she 's selling you a pig in a poke . we better do this tonight . 
no , i guess you 're stuck with the <number> you 've got . have a seat . 
sounds like you got a crisis syndrome . are n't you exaggerating a bit , <person> ? call it three-and-a-half , maybe <number> ... 
and pointless . 
who did ? mrs. feur ? 
waal , then , invite someone < u > else < /u > , then ... 
thank you ? <person> , sometimes i understand why they hate you . 
my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ? 
give me a drink , will ya ? 
before your time . it was <person> <person> 's brainchild , or , lack-of-brain child . the behavioral sciences unit at quantico is essentially the product of <number> men : <person> <person> , <person> <person> and myself . <person> was a field agent , <person> administrative , i was teaching criminology . <person> came up with the concept of a serial killer 's signature . he invented profiling . everything we know about profiling started with <person> <person> ... 
she 's here now . 
and ? 
i want you to find someone for me . 
can you fix it ? 
well , that 's because he 's the devil . and he wants to keep his throne for another <number> years . <person> is fine with me , but not with my brothers , so they broke out of hell , causing my dad ... 
yeah . how did you know ? 
yeah . 
yeah , get out of here ! beat it ! 
if i had answered , what were you gon na say ? 
okay ... it 's so good to see you . 
who remembers . 
perhaps not . you seem to have misplaced a private . no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck . 
but i came here to ... 
in a couple of days this whole thing -- 
i guess that puts me in my place . thank you for the hospitality mrs. caldwell . it was a true awakening . 
just did . <person> ? 
stop looking at me like that . she 's not an indulgence . she happens to be our new receptionist . she goes with our new surroundings . 
she 's fine . 
oh , what did i run into ? a bunch o ' jesus nuts ? religiosos ? prayer wo n't stop a bullet from <number> of those storm troopers and prayer wo n't keep <number> of those monsters from eatin ' your liver for lunch . 
dawson , sir . 
well , good . <person> like that you do n't have to keep an eye on . 
i just called for a second . 
no , <person> . i 'm trying to tell you that when you 're ready , you wo n't have to . 
i think it 's a different place for each person . 
... sittin ' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar ! and let me tell you something else . i did n't join the service to let people like you turn ... 
okay . you 're probably right . 
also <person> dewitt . 
... tell them ... 
listen to yourself ... do n't worry , it 's alright . we 'll find him . what 's wrong with you ? 
having considered my position here at court , i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign . 
this whole time , you 've kept your head . you did n't go money simple like me and wes . you 've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here . and you 've been fair too . i mean , even after i ... you know ... 
you 've got to stop them . please ! 
no fibers , skin flakes , hairs ... 
<number> days . i left to think . 
no.the guy 's dead.what more do you need ? 
fine . i 'll do the shopping . 
whoa . do n't touch that . < u > pursuit < /u > < u > mode < /u > . <person> pilot . computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits . installed <person> <person> . underground rumor has it they modeled it after you , sir . 
do n't jack with me . 
i 've suffered the tortures of the damned . the tortures of the damned , sir . 
only everything ... 
herb . < u > i have to go < /u > . 
your hair fell out ? just like your father . <person> hair . 
she 's in the hospital . 
here it comes ... . 
that woman was a student of yours ? 
you know the motherfucker 's a bail bondsman , do n't ya ? you know every last <number> of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ? 
what ? no i 'm not . 
assets are anything of value a company owns . sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole . by selling them off , i make a profit . 
your honor , <person> <person> lived with the defendant for many months . i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson . 
tickets ? 
i guess so . 
a donny chiba triple feature . `` the streetfighter '' , `` return of the streetfighter '' , and `` <person> <person> '' . 
because that 's no good . remember , we did what we did , we took the money . it was a material calculation . but what 's the use if it 's underground , or in some funny bank in some funny place ? if you ca n't spend it , if you ca n't have it , what use is it ? none . it 's nothing , all for nothing , if you do that . i did n't get into this for nothing , so that i could have nothing -- 
i just figure things 'll go smoother , you know , if we have it all worked out from the beginning . 
i got ta tell you , <person> <person> , i 'm not comfortable getting in any deeper . it 's <number> thing to look after jess ... 
<person> ... i was thinking of <person> . what d'you suppose happened ? 
i 'll be sure to ... 
know what i did n't know . and do n't call me that . 
right . i was a great athlete . tell her , <person> , i was the best , i was all schoolyard . 
now , ma -- you just try to set an example for me , and keep hold of yourself . 
oh , you know . she was sixteen or seventeen . 
vamanos ! 
well , we should talk . you going to have time for dinner ? i 'd like you to meet <person> . 
you say that just to flatter me . 
then let 's set the date . 
you mean , like a trip ? 
want to go out and have <number> with me ? 
no , for the asylum . 
beethoven . he created it , and yet he never actually heard it . i suppose he heard it all in his head , somehow . 
thank you , <person> . you are very gracious . 
look , i 'm not trying to rub anybody 's nose in anything . the important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible . 
no . 
<person> criss is my inspiration , man . if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo , i 'd consider it ... money ... hey , how 'd you know that ? 
wrong answer , fuckbag . this is the very moment of your reckoning . in the next thirty seconds you 're going to open <number> of <number> doors . the first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood . 
oh man , i can just picture you slow dancing like a dork ! 
and i do n't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not , <person> <person> , but i did n't cut you . 
knock it off ! 
that light is not daylight , i know it , i . it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua . therefore stay yet . thou needest not be gone . 
red herring would have been too obvious , do n't you think ? 
very good sir . 
plus , what else ? <number> <person> <person> , <number> <person> <person> , <number> soldier 's medals , <number> vietnamese crosses of gallantry and ... uh , a handful of <person> <person> . 
'cause your lips is getting black . 
better get him to a hospital . 
good . 
you did what ? 
stop being defensive . i want to help you . i wrote a song for you . 
you are ready , then ? 
<person> farmer , is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ?

`` <person> <person> '' changed my life . 
if <person> has the letters , he 's much too smart to let you find them there .

you snore at night . that bugs me . can i take you out ?

we are gon na finish this film < u > just < /u > < u > the way i want it < /u > ! because you ca n't compromise an artist 's vision !

that 's right : there 's not hardly enough work these days , nothing that pays the big money , anyhow . then along comes this job , paying so much goddamned money i could n't afford not to take it . somebody 's paying through the nose for this . 
wo n't he kill you if you do n't let him know you 're auditioning ? 
i made it a contest ... the one who does best gets his cereal back first . children like to help ... they only need to be kept after a little bit . 
okay : this may sound crazy , but -- 
how could i ever leave ? 
ma ! leave me alone ! 
well , life is n't that simple . so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet ? that has nothing to do with either fear or love .

you 'll never get away from me ! 
perfectionist . 
your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born . i was drunk and i was foolish enough to answer her . 
the job is worth about <number> <number> euros . pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money , <person> . you leave tomorrow . 
guess again . 
god , you have great legs . 
it 's the waves . <person> 's music , my mother used to say . she was crazy for the ocean .

hello , my name is <person> <person> .

she 's ... she 's dropping the anchors . i thought the coast guard could find us easier if ... 
do n't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth . 
your father was a friend . goddamn it ... i watched you grow up . how do you end up treating me like this ? 
yet you could do it to me ! snatching me from my mother 's hands like <number> monsters in a fairy-tale ! could n't you have waited ? six more years and i would have had that shape ! and now you weep ! you have n't tears enough for what you 've done to me . 
phone 's out . i hope the pipe 's -- 
viewer ahead , sir . 
i can understand that.. but please do n't start crying again . 
it 's rare ... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep . they diagnosed <person> with simple insomnia ... but that 's not what it looks like to me . he has every indication of having _insomnolesence_ . 
or maybe you just think you do . just another small town . <number> guy chasing you . you go big town . just gon na have <number> guys after you instead . <person> kissy kiss . it gets down to <number> thing -- are you a human being or are you <number> of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? cause you got ta remember you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , that 's where you gon na be . 
< i > the money exchange will take place at top of the world at the stratosphere . get there at exactly midnight. < /i > 
i 'm not from a newspaper exactly , i - 
mine . 
not what . who . 
no , i came because we need - 
same thing that happened to you -- i stopped poutin ' there on the sidelines . got in . <person> on the team . i joined the working week , you slick fucking asshole , so why do n't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy , <person> . 
mr helpmann ! 
i do n't know , kate . 
about a dozen officers and men . 
okay , but that does n't excuse his – 
you tell lies , dad . you tell amusing lies . stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime . they 're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty . and the thing is , i believed you . i believed your stories so much longer than i should have . and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything ! -- i felt like such a fool to have trusted you . you were like <person> <person> and the easter bunny combined . just as charming and just as fake . 
it 's not what it looks like ! 
<person> , i did n't know . 
listen -- 
penny -- ? ! are you all right ? 
what ? 
uh . no it wo n't ? 
you no-good pup ! 
sir , yes , sir ! 
yeah , yeah . <person> , you wo n't tell anyone about me , will you ? 
but you could bring 'em in here ! we 'll pay all your expenses . 
honey that 's very mature , i 'm proud of you <person> . 
he notices . 
tell him the state of mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown . 
get it over with ... 
yup . that ’ s why you get to keep your money . 
i said i did n't want to do the sketch . 
what a gasser . 
i ca n't say for certain until we get him back to the lab , but my guess is he was masturbating , his heart seized and he died . that 's when the girl found him . something smells like shoe polish . 
okay . 
i need flesh and -- 
how can i ? you lied to me -- the way <person> did -- and after promising you would n't . oh , i want to believe you , <person> ... oh , but i ca n't call you that anymore , can i ? it will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which i do n't even know yet . what is it ? are n't you going to tell me ? hello -- ? 
that works on my nerves , you bein ' so buddy-buddy with him . 
what ? 
`` fun loving '' -- insane . 
me ? ? 
afraid i 'm ruining your reputation , m'sieu laval ? 
some other time , <person> . some other time . 
you 'd meet doctors , lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they 're divorced . why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife ? that 's the way those hotshots are , all of 'em . 
how long ? 
yes . 
some people got faces that stick in your mind . 
so what i want to know is why <person> still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in . 
prepare a tear harness for the female ... 
yeah . 
no , he did n't . 
i can imagine . 
we are here on sufferance . i am here ... 
told each other everything . that why your picture 's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau ? 
what ? 
space for what ? to o.d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it is n't . correct ? 
she 's a < u > cartoon < /u > , dude . 
no . 
do you really love me or are you just saying that ? 
shhh ... 
all right , when ? 
the sheriff . 
vat about it ? 
you 're going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you . 
i do n't think he sees you as a guy guy . 
<person> would n't hurt a fly . 
oh , that 's just my daughter in the bathroom . 
no , sweetheart , it 's a stag party . does stay home . 
i asked you my name . you just saw my commission slip . what 's my fucking name ? 
we have to get to sonora . there are jobs waiting for us there . we 'll pay you for your trouble . 
i guess we 'll just have to kill her . 
she is preparing a great abundance of food . 
what is ? 
thanks . you are just a wonderful person . 
you mean , besides <person> ? i 'm a human being . sure . once . first time i ever ran away from home , i got as far as atlanta . i met this boy . he 'd been with his parents on their way to chicago . they stopped at a gas station . he went to the john . when he came back they 'd split . we sorta started looking out for each other . aw , he was sweet . and boy , was he good looking , y'know , dark hair and eyes . the chicken hawks were on him all the time . he hated that . sometimes we 'd find a safe place to crash nights and we 'd curl up together and we 'd talk about all these crazy things . the <number> of us getting married someday . having kids . <person> stuff . 
hyperactive little fuckers , too . tough to keep up with in a wheelchair , i bet . 
it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind , but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design . 
she ’ ll get over it . 
i 'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days . you 'd be doing me the favor . 
<number> throws it is . 
here . <person> <person> . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms . 
no . 
i didn ’ t know my husband and <person> knew each other . i just ... do you think we spoke about it ? i ’ ve known for <number> years . he ’ s known i ’ ve known for <number> years ... but not once have we spoken about it . there are things <number> just doesn ’ t speak about ... 
waal , that 's what i 'm saying . 
could n't handle it then . now i can . 
i do n't want to take 'em out . just want to keep 'em interested . 
whatever . <person> . `` tell laura i love her . '' that 'd bring the house down . <person> 's mom could sing it . 
o.k . and i 'm not in love with this fukker ? that 's how i feel about him . 
nothing but net ? could be a swish . or a muthafucking air ball . 
it tastes like fish . 
that 's great zydowski , you tech guys are really on the ball . harding - call the print lab at the fbi , run the prints through their library , see if it 's less screwed-up than ours ... 
pete ... 
no , no , that 's impossible . 
could you bring it up ? 
no . 
run a check . fbi , interpol . 
anyplace really public , they 'd know about it -- they know everything at the committee , <person> -- 
i did n't forget .

tough ... ... i get off duty at five-thirty . how long you been divorced ? 
we 'll see . if it does n't , what the hell , at least i gave it a shot . 
i told you -- 
no . i 'm going over there . you take the car from there , get out to the lake . 
i do n't want to have to sit next to snorri all that time . 
of course , of course ... 
why are you marrying <person> ? he 's a fool ! 
i went to bed . <person> 's a big man , but i 'm in trouble after a couple of drinks . i 've suffered all day . who found him ?

i 'm already late .

<person> does n't exactly cover it . 
no . she 's gone . 
he had to come from somewhere . 
but , i do n't know how . 
why get rid of her at al1 ? you 've used the coffer of shadow too much . it is beginning to rule your heart . 
okay , okay . i 'll let you hit those books . 
do n't worry about it . 
actually , <person> helped me put it together . 
it was n't supposed to be , it just struck me that way . 
you remember how i was , louis.. the vampire <person> ... 
no . 
how 's that ?

hey , chemicals , fear , sleep- deprivation -- and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult -- hell 've a recipe for a mind-fuck .

new york 's finest . this is his case .

you could do that ? 
i am thrilled for you , but tell me this ... how 'd you get <person> to do it ? i 've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion , but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea .

you can have what i 've got . it 's right there . 
you have to ask ? 
a whole ten cents ? ! 
oh no ! 
you want to take my console into your office ? 
yeah , i really cleaned up on him . 
it was a piece of wood . a shitty piece of wood . it 's not fair ... . 
good , you can get this under control now . 
let the blow drive the boat down wind . neutralize our canvas . 
still stuck on her , huh . 
thanks a lot . 
yes sir . 
come on where ? back to a one-room apartment that i ca n't pay for ? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not ? 
well , besides <person> , of course . 
how 's this about me ? 
oh ... 
was his father stationed here ? 
no , this is the place for the young yakuza . 
that 's what i heard . 
positive . <person> , they planned this . 
no lightspeed ? 
you say in the report <person> did n't have a gun , but you let him get away , too . 
do n't snap at me like that . you 're lucky i do n't punch you right in the face . 
yeah , birds . all they do is make a mess of everything . who needs them ? 
i miss them , too . 
you have to save this boy . good exists in this world . i can prove it because you can , in your life , save this <number> person . 
that 's a good idea . 
what does a man usually tell a girl ? 
it 's not healthy with it closed . 
fucking <person> <person> lost my kronos complaint . <person> must be filed by fucking <number> o'clock ! if it 's late , there 's no case ... every problem has a solution . 
then i 'll go with you . 
will i go crazy or something ? 
it 's not . you 're money . any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you . 
get lost ? 
key ? 
no ? say , listen—i 've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat . toughest job i ever tackled . ever hear of j.p. clarkson ? biggest man in the country , is n't he ? well , i tamed him . got him eating out of the palm of my hand . i 've browbeaten financiers , statesmen , foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but i 've never been able to do a thing with her . she 's been too much for me . i 'm glad you think it 's easy . now listen—if you 'll do what i tell you , perhaps i might develop a little respect for you . you never can tell . 
you 'll see ! 
to you , sir ? 
hmmm ... . 
hell , no ! 
you bet i did . i got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now . 
<person> . 
you are right . but it is a trap . 
<person> guard , special detective detail . we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk . 
only common sense . 
i could n't tell -- she could 've meant like , `` i love you grandma '' or `` i love you vanderbilt . '' 
i do n't rattle , kid . but just for that i 'm gon na beat you flat . 
but i do n't want to be like that . i want to do something ... 
charges ! come on , come on ! 
everything ? 
uh hey , does anyone wan na see my unit ? 
oh . new cars . i see . well , you came to the right place 
we 're a small convent , bishop . surely there are ... more appropriate shelters . 
who ? 
went ballistic ? 
what 's that ? 
i -- i thought you were -- 
only the wet ones . 
use the thrusters and you 'll be fine . we 'll huddle together out there . 
for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic . pardon me . excuse me , sorry , sorry ... 
-- in other words , <person> -- with this <person> <person> <person> on the fire -- the man who goes to the senate now in sam foley 's place ca n't ask any questions or talk out of turn . we must be absolutely sure of him . 
i 'm well aware of this asinine article . and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper . 
you heard me . you <number> , especially . 
he 's working a double shift . 
you want to know how much i got tied up in deposits with <person> ? we 're in for <number> weeks solid , <person> . 
yeah , that 's the one . 
she asleep ? 
yes , my bag ! 
who are these people ? 
i do n't hear no fat lady . 
no . 
yeah , but - 
what ? 
you sure ? 
i hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is , sire . my impression of <person> is that he is moody and impressionable , capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments . he is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity . you have dazzled him , and you have performed a diplomatic miracle , but <person> is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear . 
pete , if <person> <person> <person> walked in here wearing a dress , i would n't know him . 
you want to know my idea of a marriage ? it 's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there 's a down ... and when there 's an up , well , hell , a little goddamn applause or an attaboy would n't be too bad . i needed that , <person> . i deserved that . 
it was warriors plus <number> this morning . 
just remember <number> things . first , the law is a living thing . it made us free and it keeps us free . sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes . sometimes it makes mistakes , sometimes big mistakes . but in the end , the law prevails for the just . sometimes , it takes a while . 
it 's a television show . <person> ? that 's all . it 's just a bunch of fake sets , and wooden props , do you understand ? 
<person> nygma , you 'll forgive me for being rude . but what exactly is on your mind ? 
you wan na go out with him ? 
remember the message ... the future is not set . there is not fate but what we make for ourselves . 
yes i did . you asshole ! what about the room ? 
we 're a little emotional here . it 's <person> , maybe we 're over-reacting . 
indeed -- well , you may tell dr. corvisart , i should be entirely satisfied with half her success . 
i do n't know . <person> ? stanzi ! 
you name it , i paint there . 
you do whatever i say you do or else you put it on the trail , son . 
oh , i 'm sorry . this is <person> <person> . <person> , <person> <person> . 
put them down ! please make them put them down . 
it 's a present from my parents . 
you 'll never make that stick . 
yeah ! 
thank you -- i 've worked hard to become so . 
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers . nice guy . good looking . 
they 're your favorite flower . 
they were just bad men , that 's all . 
uh-huh . 
i know where we could get the money . a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars . 
yes , i saw it . 
you know , your hyper sensitive spidey senses ... like spider-man ... ... you know , like in the comics . 
i -- i was just going to lunch . 
really ? 
yeah , no shit . 
there 's something else too . 
no shit . like <person> <person> ? 
well , it 's just that i would think that the woman who is the real , non- imitation <person> would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea . really angry . 
you said it resembled my apartment , did n't you ? 
i dunno . do thigh high , leather boots go with a cocktail dress ? 
yeah , you ? 
i know that . i realize . but if a certain british doctor never asked `` what 's this fungus ? '' we would n't today have penicillin . correct ? 
yeah . 
he gets as much as he wants . 
sonny kicks ass . 
i do n't know . i 'm just a d.a . i do n't have access to all you expert sources . 
get up there <person> ! 
she 's praying . 
we should sign her to a talent holding deal . < b > int . keg house -- frances ' room -- next 
really ? 
i *don't* think that 's the thing to do ! no ! i think what you ought to do is -- *fight* ! 
well , that 's what i knew then . or who i knew , i should say . you see , i was trying to court <person> <person> . i went to the meeting to impress her . 
mom , meet <person> . 
not true , sir . it was only a slight tolchock . she was breathing , i swear it . 
who you workin ' for ? what do you do for a living , dickhead ? 
i 'm sure you 've seen this . perhaps you knew this man under another name ? 
i ai n't heard of nothin ' . 
and get those helicopters away from the ship . call them back immediately . 
that 's a lie . you could 've bought a dozen farms with the money we 've stolen . 
what ? if i was in nicolet 's place ? 
what are you talking about ? i 'm coming with you . 
he 's from southie ? how many people did you try before you came to me ? 
i knew him very well . we were extremely close until i dropped out . 
we 're going to register . as man and wife . and get shown to a cabin ... and then search every inch of that place , inside and ... outside . 
no . i 'll wait here . 
looks more like a morgue to me . those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on . 
i 'm not running a stage line , ma'am , and i ca n't take a chance on losing the horses . 
must be exciting , beautiful place , beautiful people . 
i guess i 've told you about my condition . 
do n't kid yourself . that portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous . he 's watching us like a hawk . 
what do we do ? 
where is he ? 
no , they 're living in nice now . 
i owe you something . 
you did this to him ! you 've removed his frontal lobes ! 
what have they got that we ai n't got ? 
... so mom . truly no grudges -- truly . a little odd that you did n't come to see me when you heard i was hurt , but the important thing i want you to know is your son is happy . i 'm working again . i 'll make do -- i do n't want a thing . would n't take it if it was offered . i 'll drop you a note from wherever i land and then it 's up to you . i hope we patch things up but know that if we do n't , i wish you both the very best ... i ca n't hear you . you heard me , though , right ? good -- take good care . 'bye . 
i am not pitiful ! i am the bridge to the übermensch ! 
what 's the matter ? you ai n't got no snifters in this motherfucker ? 
no . 
what will become of me then ? 
hey , listen ... i 'll give you something else , kittle . anything . remember ... remember that corpse washed up on <person> <person> ? it was never identified ... 
just gim me the goddamn remote ! 
can you see it ? 
well , we 'll just have to wait and see , wo n't we ? 
not a damn thing . what 's going on ? <person> <person> was here , all steamed up , looking for you . 
you got it . 
i would n't give up your day job . 
i have to go ... 
about how long <number> you heard the suspect 's second shot ? 
what ! ? ted okum does n't know shit . they 've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year . what <person> <person> does n't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl . 
how can i ? 
it 's not `` love me . '' it 's not `` trust my handshake . '' it 's make the sale . get it signed . there should n't be `` confusion '' about that . 
-- uplink all relevant files to <person> -- -- and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with <person> -- 
let 's see how we get along . 
manages what ? 
i 'm freakin out . oh god i 'm -- 
are you fucking high again ? just listen to -- 
why would the union -- 
he was not black ! he was ... tan ! weathered ! 
right here . 
the bottom . when you 're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack . 
why ? 
<person> , get this man 's file . <person> , right ? 
we 're doing the best we can . now if you 'll excuse me ... 
i 'm quite all right , thank you . 
you had it ? you did n't trust me ! 
oh <person> , the phone ... that was a fucking stupid thing to do , was n't it ? 
... would you use a small word ? 
see what i mean ? he was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years , anyway - but i knew how to handle him . that `` <person> '' - that do n't mean anything . i heard him say it . he just said `` <person> '' and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor . he did n't say anything about that , so i knew he was dead - he said all kind of things i could n't make out . but i knew how to take care of him . 
to be honest , when i 'm working , i do n't look at faces much . he knew the guy 's name . 
oui . perhaps i called at a bad time . i am sorry . 
give it to her , dad . it 'll make her happy . 
well , ya know , <person> ... does n't it say so there ? 
i 'm fine . 
try less appropriate . 
you seem to like movies , <person> . 
gus , it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here . we are talking unlimited power . we are talking `` get-down hot-cha daddy-o '' whatever you called it . 
no . missing teenager . disappeared <number> years ago . found her bones last week . buried behind some old diner , up by <person> street . <person> <person> . 
you 're not ready yet . they said <number> days . 
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to ? what is it , <person> ? ! 
watch your step , <person> . your grant could be on the line here . 
yeah . the boss sent me over to offer you a job . he wants you to write a daily column on the tribune . 
i 'm sorry , <person> <person> , this is the <person> <person> . no working girls here . 
so what happened since ? you 're worried about this kid who writes these reviews ? 
do n't question me , captain ! this is < u > my < /u > crime scene ! 
okay . <person> 's assume he wanted you to find him , that some part of him hated what he was doing ... most likely , that part is dead . schizophrenics with <person> 's infraction sever all ties with the real world . i 'm sorry , i really am . 
you guys , you guys , you 're all the same . the doctors at the hospital , you ... it 's 'what i 'm going to do for you ' ; but you screw up it 's 'we did the best that we could . i 'm dreadfully sorry ... ' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives . 
and if i can not ? 
how horrible . 
you do n't have to cover for him . it 's noble of you , but these things happen in business . 
i got ta catch up with him , <person> ! 
you bet . 
... worrying whether someone said something `` nice '' about them . all short-term , frivolous bullshit ; <person> <person> worrying about <person> <person> liking him ... 
you 're wrong . do you know i knew how to play this ? 
can i tell you something ? can i tell you a secret ? 
what are you going to do ? 
bring it left . bring it left , you 're high . 
yes , you have a dream . and maybe you accomplish your dream . but yet you failed . why ? 
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for <person> . we 'll find our own , thank you . 
check . 
like what ? 
i do n't know ! 
it 's true ! i was here last year doing a piece , remember ? i was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored mps . they were all incredibly fat and beery , huge trousers and braces . and so sweet . they all stood round me like children saying 'you ! working for television ? you 're just a young thing . ' they would n't let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying . they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'oo , can i ? ' 
-- sorry -- got an appointment to play shuffle-board . 
who do you blame for that ? her ? 
i 'm real touched . now get your sunday 's on . we 're going for a ride . 
yeah . somebody wanted to shake down <person> , she hired you , and that 's how you happen to know <person> was murdered . 
but i 'll take a rain check ... 
ta . ta . 
honey , i have a little secret to share with you . 
i say , this is all terribly formal . must i go an calling you dr. peel ? 
but i want to paint you . you appeal to me more . 
what ? 
she told me you said , `` mama , you want to kill me . '' 
she 's not gon na know , sir . 
someone waiting for you ? 
you know ? 
it has to be <person> . you said he ripped up his own pictures , he -- 
no , but <person> ... how much abuse can you take . 
for <person> 's sake , <person> ! throw me the keys ! 
but he 's <number> . what kind of stress can he have ? 
oh no , nothing of the sort . 
why ? 
know what ? 
it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen . 
what did he say ? 
what is it you seek ? 
but ... i do n't remember anything , i swear ... 
this my baby . i feel like a new nigga in this car . i get mo ' phone numbers rollin ' this , than i ever did on the bus . 
okay , then dance . show . 
why would n't they ? look at hyenas , jackals , nearly all species of predator birds -- 
playing dress-up with cretins ? that sounds like a symptom of madness ; not its cure . 
what makes you so high and mighty ? did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror . you do n't get eyes like that from ... 
i think it 's better if we find this man before he finds us again . 
cool . see you later . 
ah , i know ! you 're being very cooperative . i got no complaint against you whatever ; you got bank insurance ? 
i will , <person> -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems i 've been wrong about that . 
<person> meyers . 
he died in the bathroom . 
we all agreed to it . you had no way of knowing <person> was setting us up . 
he 's down in someplace called positano . <person> says we can make it there by morning . 
you see -- governor <person> made an appointment in this case that -- well , <person> is n't exactly fitted to the work , let 's say . he 's here to see monuments -- and pass the time . that 's important to -- to my work -- and everybody concerned . so , someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble -- 
you hired me , remember ? it 's my $ <number> . it 's my shark ... 
like what ? 
no . 
should i ? 
jack , do n't ! 
do what ? 
are you crazy ? 
i -- i -- 
which part is that ? 
what the hell have you done ? 
i do n't see how we can ever find our way back from ... 
you know , where i-i-i would get implanted from a-a donor . 
wait a second . i 'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place . 
oh , man . 
just luck , this , really . never been to <number> of these before . 
) they are now . 
i know they wo n't be home tonight . 
int . vitelli 's helicopter - day . 
ooh . 
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god , would n't you say ? 
i 'll meet you outside . 
shit . here we go again . 
he 's crazy ! 
he 's just a regular guy't needs help , honey . look at him . 
the same , your majesty . 
why ? ... what on earth for ? look , <person> seems to think you 're an innocent man . 
do you have the ... 
all right , darlin ' , do n't go off into the fourth dimension . 
so <number> of them got to him . 
i know that ! but *where* they gone ? 
but <person> <person> and <person> <person> 
you 'll pay for this , <person> a. <person> ! i 'm turning your file over to the vice-squad ! ! the prosecution rests , your honor . 
you mean , quiet like this : <number> 'm the boss . ' that 's quiet ? 
ted ... the reason i wanted to see you ... i want <person> back . 
you know , i think it 's a little late for that . do give my regards to gradski if you see him . 
nice of you to offer , <person> , but certainly not . just relax and enjoy your coffee . i 'm sure <person> will be back soon . 
not much . glorified cherry bomb . right by the civil defense sign ? some geek 's idea of irony . i been saying we need a camera in this hall . 
he wants to take me to see <person> . 
you do n't really think so ? 
describe him . 
nothing . 
how can <number> man possibly be so selfish ? 
she gone like they say ? 
it 's about me . 
all right . 
okay , let 's just . . . thank you . 
well . i 've found out some things . nothing really for certain . there are some strange people involved . 
yes , i 'm all right , i 'm fine ! go capture him . 
it 's ten o'clock in the morning -- 
wait a sec , <person> , <person> , <person> . ta- take it easy . 
here , have another glass , macfarlane . i 'll take you home and we 'll be friends again -- now that you know that you 're <person> 's man and my friend -- aye , forever . 
just wait . 
look ... you ... take her and get the hell out of here . i 'll keep 'em busy . 
you got < u > that < /u > right ! 
where 's she at ? 
why ? 
how do you know all this ? 
i would pay <number> <number> pounds just to see him hang . 
it 's not going to be lonely , <person> . not for you and not for me . 
he has a great body 
he wrote me a nice deposition . he says he just received the drugs . you did the selling . 
he did n't want anyone to know . he kept it out of the papers . he said a third wife was bad for his image . you 've got to protect me ! 
i know i do n't have to . it 's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot . o.k . ? 
no time to explain . just listen . when i yell `` stop , '' you jam on the brakes as hard as you can . okay ? 
what are you talking about ? 
we 're gon na have some help to get in the river . you know these waters , chief ? 
i think <number> of you has been part and parcel of making this situation ! 
you need to know what ? do i still love you ? 
she 's beautiful , you know ? 
your <person> ' kid . i work alone . 
yeah , it still runs . 
but it 's light in there now . 
and then some . if you 'd only told us you was goin ' to her room we could 've kept 'em busy -- 
i thought you were in a hurry . 
well ... all right . 
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car . it 's not fully proofed , but if you 're okay with a few typos ... 
that 's the beauty of the system . this is a fugitive chat room . it moves from place to place , chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours : a gardening website , chaucer buffs , a dating service . a pre- arranged code shows up in <number> of fifty porn rooms -- that 's where i stumbled across it -- notifying `` friends '' to meet at a certain time , usually midnight to <number> <person> <person> , at a certain website -- a deserted chat room , say , `` how to plant perennials . '' come tuesday , twelve a.m. , bingo , these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up : explicit sex crime gossip , who did what to whom , who wants to do what , when , why and how . 
wherever you 'd like ... 
that 's just my interpretation . actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners . you see ? walk in a gently 'z ' . there are <number> distinct movements ... 
<person> ? 
consider it . meanwhile , dig up whatever <person> <person> films you can . get receipts . i 'll call back . 
i rented a car -- it 's going to be here at <number> o'clock -- we 're driving to <person> <person> . 
huh ? grimsurd looks at his thumb . 
you wo n't . 
this is a new brig , captain . it is escape-proof . 
... that 's what it is . 
i 'm just gon na go . i figure the worst i can do is starve to death . 
you had to deal with him in running the club . 
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ! 
he personally asked you to ? 
uh-huh . 
they 'll love that . 
that 's fine , bela . we 're still rolling . just say `` dear , you 're lovely . '' 
turn on your radio ! 
i 've been trying to reach you . you 're tougher to get than the president . 
my error . 
yes . 
well , he ai n't mine , so skip it . 
not lately . 
probably hit by a car . <person> to see things in the twilight . 
goddamn . 
i truly hope so . i 'm tired of supporting a grown man . 
yeah . i 'm sorry ... <person> <person> , <person> and i broke up . she 's gone . and if we ever see <person> again maybe you can tell him that . 
nobody 's getting in here . you can tell them all that ! 
jesus ... 
then take me with you . 
i 'm saying , <person> 's pomeranian . i 'm looking after it while <person> and <person> <person> are in hawaii . 
before we begin , i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview . you could have chosen <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> <person> , whatnot but you 're here . 
i 'll deal with it . i will , i will ... 
all of them do . we 'll kill twelve birds with <number> bomb . and we 'll be rich . 
well , shoot it on the last day . 
ooo , i 'm sure mrs. <person> will love that . 
yes sir ! 
it was like that yesterday . 
- we made a fire . 
i never *asked* for any responsibility . 
oh no ? let me show you something ! 
i ca n't believe you did that ! ! 
i heard you were -- what 's that adorable phrase ? -- `` at her majesty 's pleasure . '' 
i would n't give the bum a mop job . 
i 'm a banker , friend . that 's legit in this state . 
poor question . too wordy . a good question gets right to the point . <person> , where 's my chest ? 
yes , i remember . why do you want to go to philadelphia ? 
oh , mrs. lampert ! i 'd love to see you try and convince them of that ! oh , dear . 
then we own a whole < u > town < /u > full of nowhere . 
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit . 
what do you think . 
i want to see my wife and kid . 
we got separated . 
the hell were you thinking ? 
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers . <person> is a sanatorium ; she is not a circus . the theater is henceforth closed . as for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse -- 
what is it ? where 's <person> ? 
i am in awe of it , <person> . 
really ? bulimic headcase . 
you said it like it was a big joke , <person> . like he 's wild . 
just promise you 'll do it . 
ok . <person> here . 
do n't i ? ... say , that 's mighty white of you , <person> . 
that soulless monster gets no tears from me . 
according to you i 'm a sexual failure . an animal , you said . you know now , do n't you ? 
tell them you 'll meet them outside . 
i hope so . i need it immediately . 
that 's a very nice name . where are you from ? 
when this is over , i owe you a drink . 
no you do n't . i do it all the time . 
i 'll get my jacket . 
just tell me what you want . 
the reactor . 
it 's getting better and better . keep going . 
perfectly all right . i do not like boots . 
you know what i mean . 
<number> kids tried to set me on fire . 
no we did n't . he died on his own . 
okay . what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming <person> and bourne . what if <person> did n't have anything to do with this ? 
that ill-gotten funds , borne of his degeneracy , might now effect his salvation . 
no . she really liked you . 
well , sort of . <person> likes <person> for a girl . 
no ! you mean right at the end ? alfredo that 's right , <person> , right at the end ? and do n't ask me what it means . if you figure it out , let me know ... 
i hear the dog really liked him . 
i do n't know . 
i want you to tell me the truth , mind you . 
listen , i 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i 've sorted out all this information ? 
stop it ! why ca n't i talk to you ! ! 
we found 'em both , dead . and the gear from the chopper . if they 're central american , i 'm a fuckin ' chinaman . by the looks of 'em , i 'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia . another thing , major , we were lucky ... couple of those guys we waxed are russians , military advisors by the look of it . something big was about to happen here .

bullshit ? i 'll tell you about bullshit . my gun 's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it . it is n't my macho bullshit that 's killing people , my gun is ... 
she must have been in a good mood when she said that . she usually calls me loud . 
exotic lands , primitive people , dangerous animals ... that 's what the public expect from a carl denham picture ! lead us into the mountains , <person> !

i just got to town . 
they did some great job of reforming you . 
i 've changed a lot lately . 
your passport ! what kind of a proof is that ? 
<person> up ! 
fair enough , i 'll take it to my place . 
some judge ... 
the `` stiff ? '' he happens to be <number> of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man . 
helloo ... you let him have anal sex with you . helloo ... you let him videotape you diddling yourself .

why , <person> ? you 're still a green . 
he 's a legendary masked mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete . 
yeah , well , you have to be nuts to do what you did . if you want my opinion , you should give this money back to the creeper . just give it back and tell him you 're sorry . 
fire the rockets ! 
turn it against her . 
no , dear . <person> must go on . as a matter of fact , i see no reason why you should n't be <person> 's understudy ... 
no , but i 've got this secret identity to worry about . i 'll swing the rest of the way . 
that 's the name they gave me . 
it 's okay . i want to talk to you . 
bet your ass i kin see fifty yards an ' i kin shoot this sonofabitch ... 
i do n't mind her if you do n't .

< i > <number> of a kind ... < <number> > 
royalty do not help people with their luggage . 
like hell . 
wait a second . he knows i know .

how do you draw now ? 
exactly . 
my frances ? frances and <person> have been kidnapped ? < b > ext . nevada desert -- next < /b > 
good morning . i 'm afraid this is n't a very `` <person> <person> '' for you . 
mom , i mean dad ? 
yeah . and an actor . 
we 're going to be right over here . 
i 'd say that 's a pretty good assumption . 
i asked where you got him . 
for starters , getting that gold off the ship . what they do n't know about is n't gon na bother them . 
actually , it is kind of rough . 
oh , you 've got the money all right -- you just do n't know you 've got it . 
good . 
that 's fascinating , vanessa . <person> , why do n't we go into the back and shag ? 
not in a cab ... i mean a disconnection ... get your head straight ... you know , get it together ... 
he 's not worth it ! 
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me . if i do not know it , i am innocent . 
<number> . 
do you think that guy 's cute ? 
i 'll be your guest ! 
<number> beer , <number> coffee , thanks . 
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .

<person> santa , where are you ? everybody ’ s here . 
i know . he loves that thing . 
everything .

that 's too bad . you would have been the first one in the family . 
can i write down my address and phone number for you ? 
oh , i know , was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and i broke it out ? yeah , you 're right , that was pretty fuckin ' nutty . not to mention stupid . but you know what ? i can fix that right now . 
leave us alone for <person> 's sake ! ... oh , it 's <person> . 
because ... 
heathcliff , <person> <person> , and in the role of catherine earnshaw , <person> <person> . 
yeah . 
and you defending her ? 
you 've tried it ? is n't it true that you 've been in and out of rehab centers for the last <number> years ? 
what ? ! 
if i do it , can we go ? 
a rough estimate . 
oh <person> , i just do n't know about this -- 
what about them ? 
i hope i 'm not being cross-examined here . 
it was made clear . <person> , stay ballsy . first week 's hell , then it levels out . until s.e.r.e . training , anyway . that 's hell-and-a-half . 
and your new apartment ? 
yes i am . 
alright . please do n't tell ryan i 'm drinking . 
then , it 's all over ? 
why do n't you tell me the truth ? 
if <person> says this is it , then it 's it . 
... and open the french doors and go on the balcony -- 
not good enough . we still got ta catch big geek . 
you understand this ship can not be crewed by only <number> men . you 'll never make it out of the bay . 
wait a sec . i want <person> to take a picture of you an ' me in front of the place ... 
we agreed that if i took care of the business ; i 'd be entitled to the extra . is n't that what we agreed ? 
should n't pick on that . <person> . i 'm sorry about your brother ... . 
thank you . 
yes , i do . please , <person> , be a good sport . 
or maybe just phone out for a pizza ? 
i happen to work for the police god dammit ! 
what ? 
of course i do . 
and german ? 
nah , we split up when <person> was <number> . her second husband done a runner after she got sick . they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital . we were always mates , me and <person> 's mum . i like to think they 're together again now . y'know . heavenly choir . 
a man does n't always mean the things he says . 
well that 's just typical is n't it ? 
i laugh when i feel happy . sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh . i had a lot of that . and other times that was n't enough . i had a lot of that too . i know you find it hard to believe , i 'm happy just loving you . 
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy . 
you 're ayip ! 
dad , i can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away . 
-- and you 've had some fucking meteoric rise , that 's for sure -- by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau -- 
i work too , but i still make time . 
like that ! 
i 'll take the whole tin . 
hi , <person> . this is <person> . i met you tonight at the dresden . i , uh , just called to say i , uh , i 'm really glad we met and you should give me a call . so call me tomorrow , or , like , in <number> days , whatever . my number is 213- 555-4679 ... 
serafine ? is that you ? what 's going on ?

yeah ... 
we bought him in kentucky . my mother and i took a trip down there to see him . 
gon na be tough . 
you ' oughta learn to relax . i told you i 've got it under control . 
why do you do that ? 
yeah . 
oh , i do n't know whether you know this or not , but you only have your fuckin ' casino because i made that possible !

yeah -- he does n't happen to know that we went together , does he ? 
it 's her room . she only got to the hotel this afternoon , . with him . i guess he took too much for granted . here 's the gun . 
sure , you can help me ! you can help me jump over that cliff ! i 've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain , but i have n't got the nerve to jump ! 
do n't make so much out of it . only reason i have n't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i 've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive . believe me ; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and <person> had . i 'm no better than anybody else . i 've just been busier . 
it 's a real mess down here . some- thing must a'gone wrong . no man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years . 
to do what ? be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular ? i mean , what would be the point . would you pass the butter ? 
i see them , prof . everywhere . they 're invading my life . 
i think it 's more complicated than that little man . 
yes you will . the human side of you is stronger . i know it is . 
you seem to feel fine about it . 
joke ! joke ! aspirin ! it does n't matter what brand . 
the flags of discontent . it 's the only way anything ever gets changed . do n't try to follow us . i 'm pretty handy with things like this . 
he 's only got <number> damn jacket . that 's him , i 'm telling you . 
what did you think of him ? 
well -- i -- i do n't know -- i would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet , but -- really -- i think i would live the same . 
was n't deemed a threat . 
sure . 
no ? 
you are no good to me -- in jail . 
fah from it ... 
god , i hate that time . that pick up stuff time . i just went through that before i came here . you know that song `` <person> <person> <person> <number> '' i play ? that 's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections . 
you 're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment . 
leave it -- i 'll wash it for you . 
did n't recognize you . 
you got a leak in the number <number> compartment . 
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i was n't afflicted by that man 's violence . 
that and more . 
that klutz . they send him back here , i 'll kick his ass good . 
ahm ... . 
all in the cause of humanity , helmuth . or should i call you one- <number> ? 
you 're always pointing out my negative qualities . my analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people . 
tell us about him . 
allie , he 's not . 
there 's something i think we need to talk about . 
bobby . 
frank , but not now . <person> . you 're trying to wipe out some old business . but not now . i understand . but you go call 'em back . you call the bishop back . 
no , i really like my tongue ... we 're very attached . oyyyy ... <person> , now ... promise you wo n't get angry . 
after you , ma'am . 
the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money 's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination . i feel sorry for -- 
you 'll never get it if you do n't slow down , my friend . 
dude ! it 's the v-chip ! it shocks him ever time he cusses ! 
i gave you ? 
a plague o ' both your houses . 
i can wait . where would you like to go ? we 'll make this a special night ... 
oh , yes sir . 
well , do n't let it . what are you doing ? 
it 's always been a source of deep regret , but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible . 
i have no idea . 
`` my '' ... 
<person> ' , gorgeous . more egg nog ? 
i promise . i wo n't . 
i thought i 'd wait for you . 
ever since i was a little boy dressing up has always been my greatest joy but when it 's time to be discreet there 's <number> thing you just ca n't beat that 's a strapless , backless classical little black 
what do you want with him ? 
what 'd ned say ? 
if i can .

<person> sim ? do you have him ? he 's alive ? 
you 'll be fine . i 'm going to lose you . 
do you want to see themis and <person> butchered ? if i die fighting commodus he wo n't care about you . if i live i 'll come and get you . 
leave me alone . 
yeah . <number> minute you 're studying great expectations and the next minute you 're drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend . 
thank you . 
you were n't so lukewarm yourself . at least at first . 
yes , but -- 
<number> years . 
dad , can i talk to you about track ? 
because i 'm scared , that 's why . you never smoked ? 
how old are you ? 
<person> <person> , i thought you were dead . i see you shaved off your chin whiskers . 
what are you coming here to do ? 
she 's so damn ... english . 
we 've repeated . a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page <number> . 
they 're fine . everybody < i > else < /i > ... is fine . 
i 'm already walking . where is it ? 
the scum of the earth . 
another accident ? you got to be more careful . 
... probably contain more than a hundred <number> birds ! 
<person> president , this can not be breathed ! especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin rogers ... the chinese would never trust us again . the only way , i emphasize only way , to pull this off is in secret . 
yeah ? 
alicia ! come here , have a seat . <person> <person> <person> why you wear the mask . 
-- i 'm not talking about <person> ! to hell with <person> ! 
no . 
differences exist , of course , but they 're irrelevant . for the jew , his jewishness dominates everything . even the ones who renounce it , who hate it , who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife ... ca n't escape . they 're still just jews . 
oh right . well , i have n't heard anything about the disappearance or anything ... not on `` page six '' at least . 
i hear nothing . 
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers . 
how come ? 
no . no . do n't joke about that . that 's not funny , claudia . <person> , now . 
no ! no do n't shoot me i do n't want to get shot !

i think you 're way out of line talkin ' to me like that . what you 're sayin ' is libelous , and you 're in no position to challenge my expertise . i went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid . he 's weak , he 's incompetent . he jeopardizes the whole place . there 's not much more i can do for him . 
read it . it 's a grabber .

yeah , that 'll work ... what the hell was he doing here ? 
come with me to california . 
i 'm on my way to venice . why ? 
you know , i never told anybody this , but i always had a feeling that when you die , before you go to heaven , you get a chance to fly around high school for a while . 
... why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody ? 
no buts ! accept what 's done , <person> . what we done was right . another time it might not be , but tonight it was ... at least i hope to christ it was . now you make your call ... but not a word about tonight .

to be on the safe side . i mean -- 
just a feeling . nothing personal . 
how long do you think commodus will let us live once he 's in power ? a month ? half a year ? <person> will be a prison where he 'll hold us until it 's time ...

i used to be smart but now i 'm just stupid . 
but you never came across just <number> . 
yeah , well , you know doctors . they sure hate to use that word . 
here . 
it 's more like what are n't i doing . my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company . we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley , but then again who has n't up there .

i can put you in the ring with him . even book the dates . but those big boys know how to fight . they could make you look real sissy . i was looking at that painting upstairs . it 's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything . so what 's your real name ? 'samo ? ' 
i 'm looking for you . i need your tactical unit . 
<person> <person> and <person> <person> ? 
we 're from channel <number> , yes . we 'd like to find --

considering the nature of your work , that could be unhealthy . 
meet and greet . `` i flash you some of mine , you flash me some of yours ? '' 
i saw him leaving wearing it . 
i never knew about the sailor the- ory , <person> . he might have that <number> little thing i need in his files ? 
well , mostly , i do n't believe it . 
for <person> 's sake , lilly ! 
hell of a way to die . 
i know , it 's pretty silly , is n't it ? 
gently . 
so how 's <person> ? 
huh ... ? sure i 'm all right ... 
the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later . 
<person> christ , the man does n't want to talk , so get off his back an ' let 's get on to some new business .

you 're a very stubborn man , <person> <person> . very pig-headed . <person> , show <person> <person> how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station ... 
i do n't think the producer has to do much , outside of maybe knowing a writer . 
not only did you knock me down , you stepped on my new white air jordans that i just bought and that 's all you can say , `` excuse me ? '' 
every day . 
you married that fool , <person> , that 's what . never mind , you can stay with us . 
no . no thank you , <person> . you go home . 
course , if it 's later rather than sooner , i 'd hate to be you at <number> o'clock . you 've got a lot of explaining to ... 
you said , `` teresa banks '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ? 
what are you going to do ? 
calendar for the day . you 'll find the senate manual in the drawer . anything else you want , just snap for a page . 
lock the door . lock it 
what the hell happened ? 
<person> ! why did n't you tell me before ? 
well , i , you know , i took her to the van , you know . it was goin ' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me , you know ? and she started crying , `` <person> , <person> , what 's the matter ? i love you . do n't go ! '' and i was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes , stupid mouth and i was filled with disgust , man . and i fuckin ' ... oh , man , i really ... 
a look in his eyes ! hold your hats , brother , here we go again . you think he 's <number> of those cases you 're always draggin ' in and feelin ' sorry for . like the litter of kittens you had—the only <number> she wants to keep has <number> toes and it 's cockeyed to boot . look at him . the bum ! and the crush you had on that little abyssinian ... . 
you are like me , we refuse to be fools , to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men . i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over . that was my misfortune . that was your misfortune . i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was . i had no choice . 
league record . and he hit the radio announcer , a sportswriter , and the bull mascot twice -- also league records -- <person> , the guy 's got some serious shit . 
no -- you 're right . 
that 's bullshit , 
i have a few more questions to ask her . 
it was n't a sign . it was a coincidence . 
claire . 
you sent my assistant on an errand . 
clarice ... you 're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying . 
this is natural . 
hollywood , mainly . 
stop it ! 
merrin ! <person> ! 
how soon ? 
i had to help get rid of the body . you saw it on the subway . and i warn you , <person> -- go back -- you do n't know what you 're doing , or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister . you go back to school - - go back and forget <person> . 
i 'm running the show . i make the plays , and you back the plays i make . stop thinking with your fucking balls . kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ai n't the time to `` go for it . '' i need your cover . cover my ass . 
promise . 
i never signed the contract . he 's not going anywhere . 
the bald man ! the one who tried to kill me ? 
well ... 
i 'm a junk yard . 
yes , of course . 
but , darling , they 've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe . 
thank you , captain . 
is that the truth ? 
how do you mean , start ? 
not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take . 
he records himself raping and killing her -- 
unfinished business . 
what a load of crap . <person> , a week ago i had n't even heard the word parabnormal -- 
how much do you think you 'll need ? 
the place is falling apart . 
all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version . 
i 'm gon na kill somebody today . 
you know what i mean . 
what 's lucky about that ? 
you sent them to that ship . i just checked the colony log ... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine . signed <person> , <person> <person> . 
whenever you wish . 
well , sometimes you should n't listen to me ! now i do n't know if i can make it down to <number> . i 'm having trouble making <number> , and without telling me , you sign me for a fight at <number> pounds , and if i do n't make <number> , i forfeit $ <number> ! you 're supposed to know what you 're doin ' . you 're supposed to be a manager ! 
that 's not ... fuck that shit , <person> . you 're a , hey , you had a bad month . you 're a good man , <person> . 
you got a gun ? 
oh , i forgot all about it . how 's the hands ? 
cooper . <person> <person> . oh you know , whatever pays best . little bartending , used to teach tennis , played a little competition ... . 
[ i 'm professional . i just do my job . ] 
wha-chu-say , palequero ? short time , long time , only ten dolla .

i should have done more , run more tests -- 
i still do n't feel safe leaving spencer with someone . how do you spell it again ? 
it 's over . i talked to her this morning . 
`` <number> day , <person> was visited by a surgeon . he ran his fingers across her naked skin , pulling apart folds of flesh , inspecting follicles ... '' 
it 's a heart attack . 
i thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs . 
really ? 
so there is . you do n't want to go to bed . i do n't want to go to bed . let 's go somewhere and hear some music -- have something to drink -- something to eat -- even dance . 
i do n't want a floor plan ; i want to know who ! who 's taking the ticket for this , <person> ? 
i admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly . 
i planned on catching him , captain . 
empty plot . memorial stone . <person> . they never did put her under . <person> , huh ? 
i ca n't go through with it , i tell you . 
... well the party got crazier and crazier , <number> of those , y'know `` beatnik '' type things . 
you want to kill a jew . i already did . 
jesus christ ! 
you thought my father was crazy ? 
we 'll be mighty glad to have you with us . 
with that computer -- nobody better . out there ... it 's different . you twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on madison avenue . 
for a consideration . 
what ? 
oh , i do n't know . they 'll clear all right . 
what 's she like ? what 's she like ? ... 
i 'll say . 
it 's all been a dream . 
i know . 
i think we both know who did . what 's so urgent ? 
i see . the men . you 'll strike , maybe , for your demands -- but what the wives want , that comes later , always later . 
anyway , the good news is i have all the information you need . got it from her bookie -- nice guy . you should definitely call her , ted . i mean she 's a real sparkplug , that <number> . she seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help i 'll bet she does it . 
do n't be alarmed . if it 's a lesion in a way she 's fortunate . all we have to do is remove the scar . 
oh , uptown . you know . some joint . it ai n't much . 
sounds good . oblique but intriguing . phone it in . 
so ? 
oh , how did you get burnt-out ? 
there 's no limit to what he could do . he could destroy the earth . if anything should happen to me , you must go to <person> . you must give him this message : `` klaatu barada nikto . '' please repeat that . 
not many . 
that 's what people keep telling me . 
oh <person> ... joe she did n't kill the baby . 
just tonight , please ? i ca n't handle the nightmare . not tonight . not after <person> . 
or something . they 're doing a play for the holidays .

close to retirement ? 
take it off . 
she had another name once . 
i 'll tell you , that was an interesting case . the van dorn girl . i 've handled runaway cases like it before . usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid , she pops up in about a week . everybody denies ever seeing her , but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home . well , i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice . in fact , certain people for this girl and -- nothing . i guess i gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal . 
yes ... 
<person> , the enterprise is <number> years old . we think her day is over ... 
he did . 
<person> , you know how much i do - but over the phone , now really , that 's kid stuff ... 
just until the deutsche mark turns ...

you know , it 's interesting . the south lost the civil war , but they still seem to get all the glory . 
what has he been to me ? i mean , he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing . like it was easy . and i 'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she 's the one with no sense ...

of course . <person> <person> , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing <person> <person> to select a program ?

if he has anything to say about it , yeah . i 've been asking a lot of questions and i do n't like the answers i 'm getting . he 's made a lot of people nervous , including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star . 
what did you think , that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a slayer ? 
here . <person> . 
i see some faint lettering . it appears to be the ... runic alphabet ? 
<number> <number> dollars . <number> thousand <number> hundred and fourteen dollars , to be exact . 
if you 're up to it , i 've got us set up in a suite upstairs -- 
look , we handle it ourselves , for right now , okay ? we cover the bank , whatever . you and me . that way if nothing happens , or more accurately , when nothing happens ... i do n't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are . 
i know my behavior is ... erratic sometimes . 
if it please the court , i 'd like to ask <person> <person> to remove his shirt , so that the jury can have an < u > accurate < /u > idea of what we 're talking about . 
<person> ya . we broke that mothafucka . 
viktor , <person> simply has to get close to simone in this scene ! he has to touch her . he has to ! 
eric , that is not appropriate . 
that boy wants me to . 
i have some friends who have had a accident -- 
well , that does n't matter ; that part never interested me anyway . the beatnicks were before my time , and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope , clichés and the clap . but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl . 
you 're kidding . 
yah ? 
what happened ? 
do n't tell me you 're on his side . <person> . 
a snake ! ! 
i would also like to apologize .

i understand and i 'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up ... . ... after the first of the year . 
do n't you want to kill me ? 
no , you do n't . 
... until the plan changed , when <person> 's mom gave us these tickets . what , rachel . 'forgot ' i told her ? 
you have issues . i mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out . 
where ? 
<number> years of it . surely , you ’ d have divorced him if he disgusted you ? 
eject the core . 
when i thought about this , that was always there , in the back of my head , that image of me on my knees , crying . it would n't go away and it would really upset me . it was something that i could never get away from ... but now , i feel it 's okay . i feel good . 
okay . 
no , not that i recall , i was asleep . 
i 'm taking care of that , <person> . just hold her . <person> . i guarantee you this 'll clear her head . she 'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing . 
i do n't know . 
baby , i finally got you alone in this <person> and i do n't wan na be discussin ' hair care . 
our doctors are seen by appointment only . 
divorced . remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist , or pediatric gynaecologist , in sausalito . 
what 's its current position ? 
lydia , we 're the first trickle ! in a couple of years this whole town will be < u > filled < /u > with people like us . 
holly ! 
that 'd be a first . 
actually , you know , that 's not a bad idea , send a signal we 're growing up . 
as long as that 's your only problem you 're ... 
me , too . 
show me a human and i might have ! 
i have my family . also our lord jesus christ . 
yes . perfectly . 
<number> frontier land 's the only land affordable to poor people . so after <number> years indentured service in virginia , they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin ' by another 's leave ... their name was <person> . <person> & alexandria . 
oh , yeah . 
okay , you just got ta calm yourself down , that 's all , just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you 'll be fine . 
we need fuel , and a couple automatics . 
you have no conception of this , do you ? 
yeah , he 's the mafia . <person> <person> <person> or cement and contract , you know what i mean ? 
i mean tomorrow or the next day . 
<person> much ? 
yes , an astonishing power over weak minds . 
he gives a good report and i walk ? 
no , it 's you that is full of shit . and blood . and bones . a typically imperfect organic being . you 've been hopelessly predictable all along , but you 're going to have to do better than that now . 
i 'm an electrician , not a wet nurse , y'know . 
i 'd get bored . 
... yes you heard me ... do n't ever call back here again . 
nothing . they 're my patients . it 's my decision . i want the dreams stopped until we get some answers . 
then you would use your -- 
yeah - <person> . 
baack ! 
you look nervous . 
least i 'm not down there herding sheep ! 
oh , that phone call ... 
and why do you tell us this only now ? 
sailor ? you expect me to believe a man 'd be goin ' around with a arm sewed to his nose ? 
well , why 'd you have to tell that indian story ? 
no . she was mindless but not like <person> <person> . but the houngan cured her . 
what did you think of the music ? 
our platoon has the best assignment of all . we 're the first into battle ! 
nice embellishment . 
and thus unable to declare her love 
if that 's the way you want it . 
light him . 
yeah . 
yeah . so the idea is that ... you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep . 
it does n't seem right . 
ronny , please ... 
archie . 
gotcha , <person> <person> . who is that ? that you , <person> ? 
what was it like ? 
on what ? 
jesus . 
when you remember ... 
then i 'll just christen the jug , with your permission , <person> . somehow or other , waiting 's wonderfully shorter with a jug . 
be patient . 
well , why do n't ya read it . 
she did n't hear me . she asked me to repeat , so she could understand what i said . but i would n't repeat it . <person> shyness . so i 'm a bachelor . 
<person> . 
i do n't have any time to see you now . i 'm doing grand rounds and then i 'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then -- 
just find the girl . 
worse . 
i keep the heat on . 
very well . 
oh man ! hey , you still going out with her ? 
when ? 
felt like a hydro concussion ... an imperial cruiser . 
how long were you in ? 
that 's always a good idea ! would you like some money ? i have a great deal of it . 
hold it , hold it . here . 
he gave me some new code-fixes this morning . i said , `` did you really do this just today ? '' cause i was impressed . he said `` what 're you implying ? '' 
who has ? 
like hell they ca n't . they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on . 
you bet . 
you are the human . the hunter . the thing that comes in the day and kills -- 
never mind that . if you ca n't get my breakfast ready - and ca n't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job . 
no fear of that now . 
<number> chip ? 
for what ? an abortion ? 
it could n't possibly interest you . 
a polish pilot . it 's like <number> of those jokes on the wireless . 
the thing is , i really like him . i finally meet a guy i really like and i 'm a fuckin ' werewolf . 
uh ... they change it every month . i would n't know . if there 's trouble on the floor , you 'll get security coming through . what you got ta do , is get inside that doorway once they do . you got ta draw 'em out . 
interesting . mine say the same thing , and they do n't mention you , not even as a valet , although we could talk ... 
you sure knew a lot of people in high places . 
what did ya do ? 
the army hands you a command , you go wherever it is . 
help me , goddamnit , we can get the disks later ! 
me ? 
well you figured wrong ! and now i 'm public enemy number <number> . you have an answer for that ? 
yeah ? 
look , you stay away from the mayor . next fall , barring a disaster , he 's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends . you read me ? 
we think you are dirt , less than dirt , worthless . 
presently , <person> <person> . 
just say what you have to say , woman . what other people think should n't matter to you . 
go ahead . open the fuckin things . you should each find fifteen <number> -- 
sir . commander , <person> on emergency channel . he orders you to surrender this vessel . 
fbi ? what you investigatin ' ? 
wh-wh-where ya going , m-m-mac ? 
nothing comes to mind . 
i know , but since we 're talking , i thought i 'd mention it . 
he always shows up when somebody 's in danger . 
and you 've checked the ram to be sure it 's synchronized with the clock . 
ask him . i do n't know . 
huh . that was nice of me . 
i 'd be very surprised if our suspect was from brainerd . 
no thanks , birdie . 
not if you want me to keep makin ' 'em for ya . 
why would i let you do that ? 
it was staged ? 
captain , it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place . it will happen again if we do n't correct it . 
the name <person> <person> is blackened . you share that name . 
they 'll change the limit before i change my mind . 
... so it blows up that big ... what they call an omelette surprise ! 
i do n't think that 's true . 
perhaps 
he needs me , ma'am . 
you had no inner feeling ? 
no . 
hey . 
yeah . but not for long . 
i deserve to help you . do n't you see how much this means ? my father ... he ... he was a good man ... 
i 'm sorry for the woman , fettes . but her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens . as for me , fettes , i let no man stop me when i know i 'm right -- when i know that i need those lifeless subjects for my student 's enlightenment and for my own knowledge . and if you 're a real man and want to be a good doctor , you 'll see it as i see it . 
oh , fine . how are you ? 
they wo n't be left back . they 'll stay in their grade . 
keep your eyes peeled . 
i do n't know . it would n't be very smart . 
never read a book in my whole life . 
practice enough this week , you prick ? 
but , <person> , i would -- 
and get your bone smooched . 
then -- 
<person> monescu . 
is that why you did n't write anything else ? 
okay ... take your time ... i 'll ... i 'll go for a walk around . 
sorry ... 
you do n't know that . 
i feel much better . thank you for asking . and you ? 
and <person> 's instructions to divert them -- it 's all there - look , even his home phone number , when he logged on . 
it 's no problem , i had a mother once myself . 
did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps ? 
this is n't `` piggy-back . '' 
well what would you call him . 
an extension on that astronomy paper ? because , uh ... 
i 'm sorry , <person> , i do n't know much about.. 
a few years older , perhaps . 
ma ? did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time ? 
well , last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities , and now we 're talking about your concern over the garbage problem . 
your ... lover ? 
you follow directions good . now let 's wrap this production . go to the sunrise studios backlot . i 'll call you when you get there . 
not an option . just get up slowly like everything 's cool . <person> , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , i 'm not gon na let you down . 
but i do n't gamble , <person> ! 
why ? 
if you went down on a horse ... you 'd tell me , right ? 
you just havin ' a fit . you ai n't goin ' nowhere . 
wow . why would they do that ?

as brave as my father . as wise . 
i was an american , i just did n't know it yet ... 
object to the form ! 
are you sure ? 
d-day . 
you 're only twenty-five tons off quota . barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day . it 's just a day off . you do n't have to take it , i just thought it might help . 
not exactly . 
well , i guess they 'll just up an ' run anyhow , them <number> . 
you figure ! 
at least let me give you this back . i washed it . 
this gets better by the minute . 
none of this was here before . 
why you drinking so much ? 
is this a bad time . 
`` oh , tract housing , huh ? '' laugh . `` you need a new real estate agent . '' 
i do n't know . 
i 'm not in love with you . 
oh my god -- and you are looseleaf harper .

... -tor long . 
not without massive sequence gaps ! 
mexico ? you going to mexico ? 
you 're tense , darling . you could use a long , slow screw . 
then listen to this : i have to get those leads tonight . that 's something i have to do . if i 'm not at the movies ... if i 'm not eating over at the inn ... if you do n't do this , then i have to come in here ... 
well , that 's funny , because i happen to have <person> <person> right here . so ... so , here , just let me- i mean , all right . come over here ... a second . 
but the good witch of the north told me not to . 
never . a shoe that size i would have remembered . 
well then who did ? ! 
you , my lord . 
what the hell is that , some kind of porno store or something ? 
come on , let 's go , i got to get back . 
uh ... i 've been sorta keeping a low profile ... the academy ... i graduated today . 
she knew what was going to happen to me . that 's why she hid me away . 
... wants a piece ... 
except for the part about my setting up a company in zurich and knowing anyone named <person> <person> and having any relationship whatsoever with the gambino family . 
he hears ... everything . 
i believe in that system ... 
we know <number> things about man-eaters . first , they always return to where they 've attacked before . second , they 're always old- they ca n't catch other animals so they turn to us . and third , they 're always alone- they 've been cast out by their pride because they ca n't keep up . 
we got <number> around that age ... 
how do i find them ? their offices are empty . 
still playing by the rules . you 're a damn good kiler . 
i 'm <person> . oh , you have a guitar ! 
fuck , man ! i may as well have posted flyers . right out in public , man . 
i mean , what do you think ? 
yes , just the <number> . 
father , i 'm right here . 
you 're the reason i never met him . you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it . 
how 's kip ? 
i saw a man today , a man so hideously deformed who 'll spend his life in a hospital bbb ... 
i know . i called them . 
as i said , sir , we 've got all the people we need . 
no , i 'm okay . 
... in missoula . all we need to do is get to <person> before anyone else does . 
in any case we do n't want your cash . 
no problem . 
the rest of the house is probably worse . when can you and i get started ? 
<number> years . 
nothing . 
i reckon . 
athos , do you understand this ? he confuses me -- 
that was for <person> . 
yes sir , i do . last night 's , fresh from the park .

i can not . 
for what ? 
i know all you are going to say —-i have been saying it to myself , but the thought will not leave my mind . she resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head . 
stop it ! 
you ca n't say that to the president ... put back `` president '' ... now let 's hear how sounds . 
you 're possessive . 
-- oh that 's too bad , it 's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something -- 
no way to start a partnership . 
shh . <person> 's party . <person> . have n't you heard ?

mrs. <person> -- i do n't quite know how to put this -- 
f for ... 
it 's in your closet . 
what we make it to ? the next season to work ourselves to death , share croppin ' for ol ' man <person> , so he can get richer and we ca n't even eat when the croppin ' time is done ?

god , if this is true this is like , amazing ! i kinda like it up here . can i visit you sometimes ? 
yes . sure . what 's a steering committee ?

what is the condition of the bridge ? 
the file , however , was kept open after your death . npe disappearances , no plausible explanation , were sometimes filed there , deleted if the bodies were found . 
if you 'd like , we can go straight to the authorities . i understand they are very interested in talking to you . 
i almost got married once . 
is that why <person> <person> moved there ? 
gambling - i owed them a lot of money . last week i lost over fifty <number> dollars !

what would i actually have to do to get you to sign this ? 
in his defense , every primitive culture known to man deified them . he 's a mythology professor , he thinks crocs are divine conduits . 
well , of course , right ... 
what ? 
... i do n't know ... 
it was hot , yes . 
we used to , every summer . 
oh yeah ! 
i 'm starting to think that everyone 's crazy to some extent . 
i 'm not obliged to give you access , you know -- not without authorization -- but i 'll make an exception this <number> time . 
behind the books . 
i wanted to talk to you . the other guys - 
we 've got seventy-five rounds for your glock <number> , but only twenty for the sig sauer , <number> pair of visco glasses with monitor , plenty of passports . you said it yourself -- if i 'm not dead , i 'm with you . 
what 's going on ? 
in his apartment - 
what 's up , <person> . 
i think we tried that . the case is over . 
few minutes . want to catch the news . 
are you going to get remarried ? 
i 've got a lulu -- why ? 
it 's not funny . it 's ... sophomoric and mindless ... and dumb . 
tell you this : you ai n't no fool . 
i told you you would n't like him . 
pinta likes him too much . she thinks of him as a father . 
no , i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone . the whole thing was really ... irrelevant . how do you like being married ? 
fine , then we do n't have a deal . 
wait a minute , <person> . lets talk this over . why could n't we do it ? last year , when we played in that gypsy tearoom , we wore gold earrings . and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band ? grass skirts ! 
are you going to take me to see <person> ? 
gus , if there 's anything i hate , it 's greed . 
anywhere nobody 's shooting at me is pretty . 
i 'm sorry , <person> , i 'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked . 
hey ... hey ! <person> down , <person> ! 
pussy love pink rocks . 
negative . 
what was it this time ? 
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses ? 
you have to start getting into your character . 
uh-huh . 
yea . 
surely you 've heard the stories ? the black pearl sails from the dreaded isla de <person> ... an island that can not be found -- except by those who already know where it is .

after <person> was finished , he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home . the next day , i finished my shift and met him around back , like we always did . i stuck a number <number> scalpel into his chest . <number> or <number> times . 
how would you like a punch in the nose ? stop treating me like a child . 
what about keeping an open mind ? 
and you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ? 
<person> redmond . they found out why he ca n't remember his lines . there 's something living in his brain . a parasite he picked up in borneo , doing the movie .

i 'm waiting for him here . the baron and i have been together all day . a hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- it was marvelous -- 
why would he do that ? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip . 
i suppose so . she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung , but i do n't figure she counted on us takin ' off together like this ... i guess this means you 're breakin ' parole , then ? 
this is your moment , do n't you see ? the instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again . when you stand up and are counted . 
wake up , <person> ! we just watched <person> 's mom torch our fuckin ' kiss tickets ! not reo speedwagon ! not <person> ! not the bay city rollers ! kiss ! if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom , i 'd sure like to hear it !

what makes you think we 're here to meet you ? 
i do n't see anything about 'rewards and punishments ' or <number> and hell . ' this book reads like stereo instructions ! listen to this ... 'geographical and temporal perimeters ... functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation . ' this is going to take some time . 
come on . 
what kind of place is this ? 
i would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse . the odds are a <number> to <number> for a good reason , bacon . . . it wo n't win . so where is ed with all the bright ideas ?

you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles ... it glitters ! 
would you know the room ? 
and she did it all for me . for love . 
you 're right , you 're a smart guy . most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar . but this is an even swap . pure genius .

wyatt , i know what i 'm doin ' . 
what killed those men ca n't be identified in simple medical terms . my god , we ca n't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv . we have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved . 
joey , you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid ?

i feel like the world 's biggest idiot . 
i know . i 'm just saying i understand . 
yeah , <person> ? 
i have a wonderful disposition , i put people right at ease . 
that 's completely crazy .

outside in the visitors , car park . 
here . 
oh , no .

i 'm telling you , you 're barking up the wrong tree .

grady tripp . <person> <person> . 
<number> <number> ? 
she seemed yare to me . 
i have lived in this place , like my fathers before me , guarding the old knowledge . i knew , when i had no son , that the great war would come in my time , and that i would be the <number> to pass on the old knowledge to a new king . come . 
there was a man named colonel wilson , from the air force base . he was talking in our class . he said we could visit him any time we wanted . i 'll bet he could do something . 
<person> <person> <person> , why do you teach black supremacy ? why do you teach hate ? 
we 'd better go ... 
i am a man . and now i 've found the brightest star of all . 
i 'm sorry because i was looking forward to that , but i ' m going back in a few hours .

i take no account of gossip , your highness .

all i 'm asking you to do is listen . `` the heavens made a girl named <person> , with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold . ''

it looks like you bought it off <number> of the brothers . 
<person> williams . . . 
yeah .

'' you do remember that , do n't you ? 
and he was ripped limb from limb ? 
the police will not know that . they will want to investigate . 
christ . you did n't just see what happened . they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up . 
very well . i suppose i could make out my weekly report to <person> <person> without your input . `` admiral lusby , regarding the unusual behavior of jean-luc picard : i find him increasingly irritable , remote and uncooperative . i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to- ''

i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ? 
<number> bullets -- minimum . 
what in the world would give me that idea ? 
i thought we decided that <person> was way too cool to be interested in sex , and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that ... 
what are you doing here ? 
i mean it tastes like every other fish i 've ever had . every fish tastes the same .

is n't there a guard ? a janitor ? a fucking cleaning woman ? i 'll take a burglar ! somebody 's got ta be in th ... 
he told me to -- he said he wanted me to -- 
-- all non-denial denials -- we 're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they do n't say the story is inaccurate . 
we 'll be fine . 
yes , sir , so it was -- thanks to you . but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written ... 
the police used him as a witness in this case . 
green spot . 
i 'm sorry . but <number> days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader , were n't you ?

coffee ... <number> coffees . it says `` breakfast any time '' , right ? 
so , what brings you out here ? pleasure cruise ? 
if waitin ' tables in a bar do n't make you an expert on human nature , then nothin ' will , and i could 've told you that <person> <person> would end up buyin ' it in a parkin ' lot . i 'm just surprised it did n't happen before now . 
nothing has changed as far as < my > authority goes ! he is < not > going to operate ! not in the little time we have left ! there 's no chance of success ! it 's sheer suicide for all of us ! 
i found this old address book in a jacket i ai n't worn in a coon 's age . toby what ? what the fuck was her last name ? 
how do you know ? 
mm . 
yeah , of course .

christ . some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere , we look . they do n't say why , and i do n't ask . i do n't ask because it takes <number> weeks to get an answer out here and the answer 's always 'do n't ask . ' 
thanks . <person> pipes and baseball bats . 
i do n't think so , but it do n't really matter . they know i 'm meeting you .

this is going to sound terrible , but ... i do n't think she matters anymore . not to him . he never finished her . the others ... he was able to make them his . 
but < u > we < /u > let him out . 
i do n't know yet . 
you and me both . sal-va-to-re . 
oh , this map will show you . it was drawn by , uh ...

you going to attack me too . the show is a hit . are n't you happy for me ?

who is it ? 
adrenaline 's wearing off . you get shaky after . it 's not uncommon . deep breathing helps . 
do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now ? come on , it 's grad night . you 've got your whole life to be uptight . 
rachel ! they 're going after <person> now -- and i ca n't stop them .

i heard from <person> you were trying to find <person> . what happened to <person> ? 
mrs. <person> ? i can tell you right now , without a doubt , that your granddaughter is alive , and did not kill <person> <person> . 
do n't you understand ? the board is going to *replace* me ! that 's what the `` new blood '' is <number> ! 
how would you like a spanking ? 
well , that 's a natural thing , <number> people go out on a date , something . they want to impress people , the other person ... or they 're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them -- 
i know . 
<person> <person> 's got ta watch out , eh ? 
mother , please ... 
it 's really terrible . 
i did n't know that .

that was your dinner ! i do hope there is no cabbage in paris ! 
what was it inside that told you to jump ? 
well , why do n't you use them ? when you come home , do n't go by <person> <person> 's place . then <person> wo n't get in her garden , and you wo n't get in no trouble . see ? 
danny , it 's true . there were no <number> <number> . at most , <number> hundred <number> <person> died in the camps . and the majority of them were from disease and -- 
the cops were all over my house . they 'll kill me for sure . 
thank you for seeing me . 
go right ahead . tell <person> <person> how you betrayed him at a secret board meeting . and tell <person> how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company . 
what would your girlfriend think of that ? 
connie , i want to be reasonable with you . you have a house here , with us . you can live here with your kids ... and you wo n't be deprived of anything . i do n't know much about merle ; i do n't know what he does for a living ; what he lives on . why do n't you tell him marriage is really out of the question ; and that you ca n't see him any more . he 'll understand . but if you disobey me , and marry this pimp ... it would disappoint me . 
houdini mice . 
i 'll knit you a sweater . 
does this violate the patient/doctor relationship ? 
good . 
does anybody live to make a second ? 
what <number> hundred grand ? 
no . bring him on deck with the others . 
my dear <person> , the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress , he does not want her for his wife . 
trust you ? because of trusting you we have a son . remember your son ? 
how ? how can you help me ? with your flowers and your perfect life ... 
whatever it is just do it . the more we play along the faster we 'll get the hell out of here . 
blue , then . 
we 're very close . 
frida ? you okay ? 
oh god , <person> , you were a child . you were n't responsible . 
we can get the war started tomorrow , but it wo n't be pretty . 
the trunk .

well , come on -- it is your life . nobody is tying you to the fast track . did you go to college ? 
it 's pathetic . you ca n't be desperately in love when you 're <number> years old . 
carrying them . they could all be carrying them for what we know . 
<person> , let me introduce you to the carter theory of criminal investigation : follow the <person> white man . 
calm down . 
i know we cousins and all , but do n't try an ' hook me up with the big little sisters .

it 's over , jake . it 's all over . 
you 're the dead . 
champion 's going to bounce back , and i want to be here when it does . 
do n't worry . 
nobody remembers that . 
get out ! get out of the car ! 
<person> 's doing some business with me . it 's nice to do favors for people you do business with . he was in a hurry . no big deal . 
thank christ we got a witness . 
egad , were you horrified ? 
prison ? 
when she ... 
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions . 
what about now ? 
it 's been a while . 
you told me to come by . 
no . 
do you understand what i said ? 
hi . 
you sound so disapproving , midge . 
from boston . <person> <person> 's son-in- law -- he was driving . i know where they 're headed . up the lake , agaway . the old man 's out deer hunting with <person> <person> , so they probably got some big weekend party planned . 
hey , you have to see my new good luck charm .

dad , did you do it ? did you take that money ? 
we got ta get out and fire a flare . it 's the only chance ! 
hmm ?

there will be no attack ? no attempt to overpower the terrorists ? 
<person> sate or not , if <person> 's alive he 'll never come up again . 
i 'm fine , <person> . <person> . 
you 're sure right . it is a strange world . 
not that kind of history . the small stuff ! about people you never heard of ! 
yeah . 
do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number ? 
you are my friend . 
postpone . we have every right . 
`` carol . '' a <number> mercedes ... she lives in the suburbs ... 
you want another drink ? 
any other family ? 
i said , someone came last night -- look , this is n't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it 's not just to come in whenever you like -- 
maybe we did n't want to come back . 
is tony the one that tells you things ? 
hmmm ... take this down . i want this quote included in the tass coverage ; 'chauncey <person> , in an intimate discussion with <person> <person> , noted that `` unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other , all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes . '' ' 
you worried about the cost ? 
oh , yes -- 
oh , you mean you ... fix the hearts ... of little babies ? 
never mind -- i 'll pay for it now . it 'll save time . 
eve ... ... by any chance , did you place a call from me to <person> for midnight california time ? 
my name is frankenstein ...

someday , <person> . 
we 're in deep shit over here . <person> 's change that plan . 
okay . 
<person> bracken . 
then , fuck you . i 'm gone . 
hell , everybody heard that story a <number> times . 
you ca n't . he gets you and you 're dead . it 's like time catching up with you , you know ? like fate . each level you get progressively less time to complete . first half of the game takes place in the wild lands . then you reach <person> <number> , and that 's the sea of darkness . there 's a two-headed boatman that 'll take you across if you answer his riddle right . if you do n't ... 
i 'm your soldier . 
maybe it 's time to start exploring other alternatives . 
why only fifty percent , ruth ? why not ask for a <number> percent ? 
do you have any luggage , <person> -- gladstone ? 
'cause you 're kind . it 's in your nature . 
but what about the past ? our past ? 
how did kittridge do it ? .. 
you 're totally gone , are n't you ? 
come on . 
on your piano , that is the swap . 
i 'm glad you 're doing well .

we < u > do n't < /u > show her breasts , we just show your < u > reaction < /u > ... 
deal . 
you got a c-plus ? i ca n't believe i cheated off you . 
oh , i 'd say about -- 
no , it 's all right . i can get a cab . <person> night . 
what ? what kind of episode ? 
-- 'cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixen 's smile and i knew -- 
well , where is it ? i- 
benjamin , this is n't a very interesting topic . 
burke , just tell me <number> thing . that you 're going out there to kill them . not study . not bring back . just burn them out ... clean ... forever . 
<number> minutes to go ! 
hi . 
he was going nuts at the park . he met this very attractive poodle . they made plans to meet again next weekend . 
put your tiny little mind at ease . 
<person> asked where i was . he expected me here . maybe someone was assigned to bring me here . 
by myself ? 
the next batter , clendenon , hits <number> outta the park . 
well , is someone coming for us ? or are we all just gon na die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse ? hey , you do n't have to worry about scaring me . 
see you . 
you must have quite some harem . 
<number> we 're producing . 
you 're not still pissed ? 
i believe it takes both . i 'd have to look it up . 
then why are you still looking at me like i 'm asking for the square root of something ! what did you say ! ? 
why , is there a new foreign secretary ? who was the old <number> anyway ? 
that 's not the way we look at it . 
take your kids . go to a hotel . right now . do n't pack . let 's go . 
... no . 
yeah ? 
he killed a police officer . 
huh ? ... oh , yeah , it is . 
you 're comfortable . this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you 've fashioned for yourself . 
sally , i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it . and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently . 
<number> double whiskeys . was wunschen sie ? 
look , spare me the sermons , okay . you 're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed . you do n't even know me . 
yeah , but what happened after she drove off with <person> ? 
could i speak to you for a second , dad ? 
his name was sean . <number> years ago . <person> pool . 
and judging by this segment alone , it 's already eaten about ... 
yes , admiral . <person> into my parlor . 
you did ? you liked me ? 
you first . 
oh , certainly . i sha n't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste . but i may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake 's sake . yes , i might do that . 
did you ever have a serious operation ? 
i have expectations , too . 
like your business managers ? 
my mother 's dead . died in her sleep . 
you 're fuckin ' a-right , i am ! 
i left in a bit of a hurry . i 'm terribly grateful , sean . 
he 's not a cop . a cop would n't have kneed me . 
we sure like havin ' you . 
well , it 's cutting awful close to me . i mean she was just here . 
where 'd you come from ? groupies r us ? 
we have to go home , <person> . 
are you in trouble with the law ? 
yeah , i think the times might be interested , do n't you ? the post might have a lot of fun with it , too . 
a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed , but off-hand , i should say that in addition to the factors of youth , health , sexual fertility , intelligence , and a cross-section of necessary skills , it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included , to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition . 
saving the treats for <person> ? 
most people are afraid of death . 
because life is n't about playing it safe . <person> is about taking risks . 
i was born with a limp , sir . the <person> used to hate it when i marches with them because my pike would always sway ... 
yes . later . 
do you have life support ? 
i 'm already on thin ice . yesterday , i actually thought my boss was going to fire me . 
i do n't know . 
forget it . 
i pass up no opportunities , i 've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows . we 'll need subjects to demonstrate . come along . 
<number> years . ever since we left island . 
yeah . too good . i forgot where i was . 
never call him that . he 's strictly an illusionist . 
nail him first , be careful he does n't panic and want to shoot somebody . local police have <number> car , a rover , should n't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it 's answering an emergency call ... if the cop car shows up remember it does n't have any automatic weapons . only a shotgun braced on the dashboard . get into a tight spot , you 'll be out of range at forty yards . then they 're down to their side guns . 
<person> ' it up here , boss . 
i hate to be alone . but i 've heard all the approaches there are ... even yours . 
oh my god . 
that 's close range . you go full auto on a guy from close range , you 're gon na be swimming in blood . look at my uniform . nothing . 
come on in . 
but you did it anyway . 
oh please , is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you ? we 've discussed <person> , for <person> 's sake . not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject . 
no , not that . i was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel <number> why did <person> have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror ? 
daphne has a beau - i have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you . 
i do n't have a choice . 
wait a minute . what exactly does this mean ? 
you know who you want . i 'll take your seat any day . so do something ... do n't sleep on it ... go over there . i do n't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it 's not always good to let things calm down . 
i know . but let 's prep 'em . we could stay here all night ... that would n't be good -- 
respect is earned not given away , trust is given away to anybody . 
in that case , there 's someone here i 'd like to introduce to you . over there . 
what 's the larger experiment ? 
i know . 
you take the cake <person> . come on , she 's not here . let 's check out her psycho ex . 
it 's gon na be bigger than big . <person> <person> . <person> <person> . they do n't have room for real golf courses in japan . 
how often do you see <person> <person> and his son ? 
nope . 
what ? 
come with me ? 
i wo n't thank you ! i 'll never thank you ! 
it is not enough to be witty , madame . people grow tired of being entertained . you made that mistake before . problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony . 
oh , good heavens , no ! 
you mean our past as in me and <person> . this has nothing to do with you <person> . 
why do you not go to them ? 
got a doctor on duty . 
i have to go , julian . 
excuse me ? 
she would if she could . 
<person> hit him . his head 's all big and he wo n't wake up . i 'm really scared . 
why ? what do you mean ? 
i 'll check it . 
yeah ? 
i crossed paths with him . that 's why i 'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood . to make sure i do n't run into him again . 
i 'm afraid you 're not really standing here right now . 
we never went to bed together . 
if i ask him to tell me , will you let him answer ? 
oh , you know the bay area ! always foggy ! 
look , i can be selfish , i know that . i 'm not blind to my own failings ... 
since you 're feeling guilty , why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it ? 
i 've got to stop in there ... <person> <person> , do you know <person> <person> ? 
yes . dead . <number> nights ago . the night of my dream . 
great ... 
i know you very well , <person> <person> . and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you . <person> , romirez , they were fools without vision . it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players . 
i do n't go there . too many party girls . 
the dockhand guy . hanging by his neck from up there . 
i 'll do it . 
goodnight . 
they are ? 
yes , mrs. hobbs . 
let 's go tell your mother . 
no . i just think ... anything can be explained . but <person> , doing a thing like this ... i do n't know how to handle ... 
hello , darling . 
yes . 
i 'll handle it . 
a blank canvas ! i could paint your portrait , directly on you . or maybe not . so , you ? husbands ? boyfriends ? girlfriends ? where do you live ? 
i keep thinking about him . 
we 're just alike . you think sex is so unimportant you do n't do it . i think sex is so unimportant i do n't care who i do it with . 
yeah . yeah . i bet ya feed <person> that same line . 
oh , it was just a spur of the moment thing ... the storm was n't that bad . 
i believe in treating the convicts with respect , if that 's what you mean . 
i got ta get the stuff . 
let 's go niggers . 
that you come with me . 
i 'm snitching <number> old timers who 'll be fishing in oregon next week . next to you i 'm clean . and smart . 
back where ? 
i ai n't read 'em yet except <number> or <number> of 'em . i ca n't understand a lot of what i try to read . my mind , hit wonders off to somethin ' else when i try to read . 
no thanks , you 've been singing that shit all week . if you try that at msu this saturday , i 'm pretending i do n't know you . 
do n't be ridiculous . 
look , <person> ... i 'm sorry ... i know what you 've been through ... i should 've seen something like this coning . 
<person> president , the probe has passed through all quadrants . the starships <person> and <person> and <number> smaller vessels have been neutralized . 
i predict we 're lost . 
yes , <person> <person> . 
what d'you know about women , <person> ? 
is he in an asylum ? 
why ? you wan na live out here all year ? it 's like living in munchkin land . 
and you , <person> ? 
why , no . 
i was hell-bound , yes that 's what they say satan was waiting 
oh my god ! 
taylor , my dear . 
and ? 
hhhuh . so we decoy her . stick a couple pillows and <number> of your teddy bears under the spread and she wo n't know the difference . 
< u > so < /u > forth ... 
cut the bullshit , we ai n't on a fuckin ' playground ! i do n't believe this shit , both of you got ten years on me , and i 'm the only <number> actin like a professional . you guys act like a bunch of fuckin ' niggers . you ever work a job with a bunch of niggers ? they 're just like you <number> , always fightin ' , always sayin ' they 're gon na kill <number> another . 
hey , i like this . 
right . 
an apprentice for thirty years . we 've noticed your people 's mental discipline . did that develop here ? 
i 'm free to do what i want ? and you think i would want to go with you some place on a plane ? where ? where ya going ? 
no , i 'm into earthworms now . you would n't be interested . they 're real `` boring '' creatures . very reliable , dependable , no surprises ... 
i suppose you do n't believe me . 
kill myself . 
well she -- 
you would . 
sure . why ? 
are you afraid ? 
and so will m'sieu giron . 
mrs. hillyer , i do n't know who he is , i really do n't . 
<person> 's counting on the exhibition 's success . the museum is in debt . contributions and public funding have dried up . <person> no longer cover overhead . the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit . <person> was hired to get us out of the red . if the superstition exhibit is n't lucrative , he 'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems . 
thanks for the jolly news . i thought maybe you 'd left town by now . you kind of just disappeared . but you boys from tuscarora have a habit of disappearing , do n't you ? 
yeah , we better . 
you do n't have to do this . 
i get scared really easy , okay . 
-- what ? 
sounds like a french word , what is it ? 
you can call him baby-bear , he loves that ... 
you pull up -- collect your first installment . then you let the daughter go . when she reaches me , i 'll dump out another third . <person> action . i back up again -- you pull forward . satisfy yourself it 's there . then we do it <number> last time . the final exchange . and we go our separate ways . 
he sure as heck does that . 
hershe . she lives downtown with <person> <person> in the big boat . down that way .

you are involved . by being alive you 're involved . 
he 's dead ? 
you 're a grown man . i 'm not responsible for you .

but father , they might come this way . 
killaine 's wise to what ? 
dynamite -- 
yes , i am . 
okay , well that about covers it . 
you did n't say find them . you said , `` get them . '' 
... to talk about it . to think about it . i had a plan to ease her into it . but , i really -- i did n't know how to do that ... 
shhhh ! i do n't like women that talk . 
there was only <number> job . <person> took the job . her friend took a hike . <person> saw her again . 
i might make him nervous . 
i can get you what you want . you just have to talk to me . i 'm your priest , your shrink , your main connection to the switchboard of souls . i 'm the magic man , the santa claus of the subconscious . you say it , you even think it , you can have it . you want a girl , you want <number> girls ? i do n't know what your thing is or what you 're curious about ... you want a guy ? you want to be a girl ... see what that feels like ? you want a nun to tie you up ? it 's all doable . 
maybe you should , but you ca n't . 
i do n't remember any arbor day cards from <person> <person> 'n ' <person> <person> . 
hello .

who are you protecting , then ? 
no , <person> <person> , i 'm not lying . what reason could i have for lying ? the chances are that we 'll never come out of that horrible trip alive , but i 'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive , than to stay here <number> more minute now . 
he 'll show . 
that <person> was dead before you got him to that statue . 
i see . 
captured ? how ? 
no , numbnuts , die . you get your nurse alone , you look her in the eye , and say , `` <person> , they 're training me for war , and i do n't know what 'll happen . but if i die tomorrow , i wan na know that we lived all we could tonight . '' i 've never known it to fail . 
so what ?

you know : how the voters are gon na play your divorce . 
<person> ' . <person> stiffed those kids . do n't want'em comin ' back and findin ' you ... start asking you questions .

i 'm sorry . i should n't have been there . 
your evil is that you can not be evil ! and i will suffer for it no longer ! 
you got that right .

never mind that shit . just point . 
seems like there 's more of it than ever before -- 
benny , this is me . i 'm going to take a look . 
what good will that do ? why , it will take control away from him . we 'll put somebody else in charge , call in all doubtful loans , and be on safe ground again . that 's what good it will do ! 
i know . 
learn anything ? 
but fearful of her virtue , she comes to him dressed as a boy 
that 's great .

well , thank you very much for all your trouble . 
he would n't . 
damn , life is strange . i had you figured for this cold-blooded , calculating bitch -- not that i did n't admire you for it . 
yeah , some creep stole my cigarettes ! 
you have , i believe , some minimal background in music . therefore , you are to join our choir . 
may the force be with you . 
loose talk is the <number> thing i worry about . 
do n't go there , <person> . you 're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick . do n't freak yourself out -- we 've got a long night ahead of us . 
well . good luck with that -- 
harm to whom ? me ? i do n't think , so . try him again at the hotel . 
it was n't her mother . the only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party . 
... and everything is nothing too . 
<person> taylor ? 
... is that i sent them here . i told them she came here sometimes . with her dirtball boyfriend . that 's exactly what i said .

i did n't say anything . will you give me those stamps ? 
we got everything we need . plenty of food . ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it ... 
later , `` dude '' . 
that a problem ? 
i 'm glad . hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you 've been asking yourself . now , we 're gon na have a little q and a , and , at the risk of sounding redundant , please make your answers genuine . want a chesterfield ? 
sure , <person> , it will be lots of fun .

i 'm just saying , the man is a problem . and he 's your problem . was n't me idea to bring him along . 
he never would have believed a woman like you existed . 
jack . 
content thee , gentle cuz , content thee . let him alone ; i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement : therefore be patient , take no note of him 
but those notations stop ... ... four-and-one-half minutes after <person> <person> <person> 's ... 
the jigsaw puzzles and the , urn , career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it 's opera and not movies . and ... 
< u > you 're < /u > doing all the talk . 
go home ! 
if possible -- both . 
we need more bars ! 
did n't you once dream you could lick people well , though ? 
i learned it from listening to you ! i hate you ! 
it 's still there , the cannon , outside the museum . it was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax , then melted down . then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - the natives . 
i under-understand that . i-i know i fucked up . 
angel , second class . 
what about them ? 
sure . 
save 'em for the girl in gingham . just tell me i 'm not good enough for you . go on . say a woman like me ca n't change . 
yeah ... 
<person> , that 's my son and the nanny . i had the calls transferred to my home so i could go over your stuff . 
she lives like all the world before the <person> 's curse lifted . now the world 's reborn , yet still she sleeps ... 
what for ? 
i ca n't bear the thought of your torture . take it ! 
no , you have to kill me . 
thanks . you interested . it 's festival seating , so ... 
what ? ! 
for others , yes ... for you , who knows ? 
it 's not often an emperor like < i > you < /i > calls on creatures like us . 
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect ! 
hey , hey , seven-twenty . seven-twenty . 
but those instructions , they 're recorded in the computer . 
pretty good -- thirty < u > miles < /u > an hour -- 
will you buy the sheep for me ? 
what happened to your hand ? 
she had the same . 
yeah , i think we do . we could try to cut each other up . but that would be bad for everybody . bad for me , bad for you . and worst of all , be bad for <person> . 
forever together . 
look in my pack . 
i got your card . 
i do n't believe you . 
he is n't here . 
<person> ? 
for god 's sake , woman , i 'm just trying to keep you safe !

for a change . 
ah , but you have n't see the real me . watch closely ... 
it 's not hard to do . i do it all the time .

well , i < <person> > am < /u > living , are n't i ? 
so you 'll continue being miserable all the time , just because you do n't have the guts to face change ? 
sure i 'm sure . <person> 's waiting . you ready to come out now ? 
what does she see in them ? 
i dunno ... 
a man eater ! fantastic ! making history , <person> 
now , just a minute . you have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why <person> should not give my wife the money which i left for her . i ca n't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation . 
it was n't like that . 
daddy 's dead . 
slow , hon . but at least i can concentrate now that <person> is here . 
i did n't mean it to sound like that . 
little black dress 
what for ? 
promise ? 
and you love him a lot . he bought you a bmw for your birthday , but you finally had to move out and get your own place . i mean , i know , it 's time to leave the nest . parents hate your smoking . you did n't tell them about the abortion . all your friends got boob jobs , you got the tattoo instead . <person> to <person> <person> . 
if he is , half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses . 
the problem is i have no idea who i 'm talking to right now . 
money . 
there you go again . you 're nothing but false notes . 
dammit ! i need a tv now ! we 're missing everything ! 
stay out of the way ! 
i . . i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all . 
do you really know everybody in the industry ? 
you do n't need a car you ca n't drive for a month . go see <person> . 
a gag . a gag ! 
oh . neither do i. voilà !

not particularly . <person> , look where this is set ! morons . 
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together . 
well then you should pay him , should n't you ? 
oh for fuck 's sake . nobody uses that gate . 
elena . 
he could ? 
you see , mr . <person> , the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business . 
no . i think you 'll want to wait on that . 
no , thank you . 
no sir ... pleasure . 
this wo n't wait until tomorrow , <person> . it 's hot and it 's ready to pop . 
do n't say it . <person> juice ? 
you could start with an apology . 
you think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months ! 
is that a threat , dr . <person> ? 
the sun .

you have no idea where you 've just come from ? what you 've just done ? 
they sedated me . we 're stuck here till it wears off . 
we 're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions .

we got russian subs creeping around . <person> ! something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here , man . give our folks medals , know what i mean ?

i asked the right question . 
what ? 
i 'll be a nice gaiijin . 
i will not go . 
phoenix ?

of course . the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped <person> with human sacrifices . the british army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of <number> . 
do i ? 
not in houston . we 'd be better off in some place more out of the way . 
i never had anything before , <person> . i never was anybody . not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins . when i was in high school i used to -- 
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way , i 'm afraid of him . 
jesus ! i just told you . i do n't know . 
what , do you think i planned it ? 
what do you want ? 
yes . 
now ! 
i do n't know . i do n't think so .

yeah and he does n't know when -- 
we 're going to get my little girl . 
hector . < u > do < /u > < u > not < /u > < u > move < /u > . 
of course . 
the tribe is concerned that many of your ... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues . 
and then we can ice her . no nun , no evil eye . 
i know you did n't . but you a grown girl . you can handle it . i got to . 
dear , you 're a scientist . do n't you believe your own eyes ? 
and smell a little funny . we 're not bulletproof and we ca n't fly . but we 're superheroes -- and that means doing what 's right -- even when it 's impossible ... this is our city -- these are our friends , our families -- and if we do n't save them , nobody will ! so i say we take a ride up that hill , blast our way in there , destroy that psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they 'll never forget ! 
she 's incredible . everything just gets soaked . 
so , of course , you could n't kill <person> because there never was a simone . 
what broke < u > you < /u > free , <person> ? 
as i said , i have n't decided what to do , exactly . perhaps i wo n't do anything . 
look at this -- people are getting married , they 're getting married ... 
i know , right ? 
no , <person> -- they are not race horses . they are good old friends of mine . i call 'em constitution and <person> of rights , the most dependable pair for long journeys . i 've got <number> called <person> <person> , too , and then there 's a supreme court -- fine , dignified horse , though you do have to push him now and then . 
you got a bet on the game tonight ? 
ugh . 
maybe she used another name . 
'cause you always tell me the right thing to do . 
the only one . 
nothing . with the satellite down , we ca n't transmit over the mountain range . he 's most likely sitting there wondering why he ca n't raise us . 
what ? now ? 
how did you know that ? 
i 'll bet the butler 's name was n't `` jeff . '' 
with a family ? 
i – would n't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark . 
yes and no . did you recognize him ? 
and the money . where do we bring the money ? 
<number> <person> ' is good enough . 
cash and <person> , you know , fdr , world war <number> ...

yup . oh , here 's your check , minus my commission . <person> , solid novelty act .

do they have a show to give it to you ? 
he 's lying . 
i was just thinking of ... the noise . 
i 'm afraid not , <person> president . the sub has positioned itself between the pierce and the soviet ships . admiral anderson insists it 's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters . the pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub . 
yeah , i know . <person> mature faster than guys . but last night , i was the one who put on the brakes . and you know why ? 
no ... i ... 
uh-huh . 
you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . <person> , i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about .

why ? 
find out if there 's a doctor on board , as quietly as you can . 
what 's that ? 
i was told that your mother died . that your mother died when you were young -- 
good ! 
it 's from the first world war , is n't it ? 
oh , tut , tut , tut . 
that 's it ! 
hey , <person> , how 's the divorce comin ' ? 
these things you 're talking about . you did them to <person> ? 
i do n't know ... 
never would 've guessed . 
this boy 's crazy . they wiped the floor with him . they beat his brains out and he wants to go back . what for ? to take another beating ? 
lots of times ... . 
this is the stuff we picked up the other day , right ? the rest of this is all .30 caliber -- 
yes . 
a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and -- 
do n't worry , <person> . she 's in good hands . you have n't made a mistake . 
so ? 
i have to work on my video project ! do n't follow me ! i can put myself to bed . 
no , no . i would n't dream of breaking your underwear rule . i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff . 
or , perhaps , until he gets us ? 
teach him how to talk back , suddenly he ca n't stop . i 'm not playing . 
you know , not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this . 
well , i could ... free up some time ... 
i did not go to high school . 
each to his fate . <person> for me at the inn . if i am not back by dawn , you will know my fate , and you must go on without me . 
you know something , <person> <person> ? you 're absolutely right .

no . is he sick ? 
i just ca n't , <person> . i ca n't do it . 
why , yes , technically . <person> <person> and i came awfully close , but he was afraid of me , i think ... 
do you really think that <person> <person> would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman ? 
could it have damaged the ship ? 
i wish i could tell you i remembered something new , but i ca n't . 
you just got here ... . 
i beg your pardon ? 
i thank you . 
yeah , that 's what he means . good old nellie ! i ought to wring her neck !

tush , thou art deceived . <person> thou no letters to me from the priest ? [ balthsasr shakes his head no . ] no matter . well , juliet , i will lie with thee tonight . i will hence tonight . 
it was n't only that -- <person> was in a jam . 
what must i do ? 
i 'll send <person> , he 'll be able to ... 
you know , <person> , sometimes you make me sick . 
what exactly are you working on in there ? what are those screams ? 
or what ? 
she 'll need to sign dispatches before she retires . 
<person> up such talk , <person> ! 
you may well call it upside down , since you occupy its lowest level . and deservedly . the eastern desert has never been explored -- because we 've always assumed that no life can exist there . save yourself , taylor . tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ? 
sure thing . please do n't worry about me . can i help you with the dishes ? 
you 'll like it here . 
tomorrow night as a matter of fact . 
the other bombers might have more luck . we should n't just give up ... 
oh . well , the clothes for instance . they were carefully preserved , and the body was just as carefully destroyed . the person who killed him counted on <number> thing ... that all skeletons look alike . 
<person> maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin -- 
how do you know she did that ? 
how are you ?

i 'm sorry ... i do n't know how to ask the questions . 
well , if it 's more than a whim , then you 'll have to prove that to him . you 'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it 's what you really want to do . if that does n't work , at least by then you 'll be eighteen and able to do what you want . 
jesus ... 
<person> testa !

right , right , sorry . 
we 'll see when we get home okay . 
i 'm scared ... 
what does he know ? 
i 'll show <person> . he 'll be sorry when i get this thing open . 
will the <number> of you shut up ! god damn it ! maybe the tests were right , <person> . she 's sensitive , she 's vulnerable , but i do n't think she 's suicidal and i did n't have to test her . maybe she was n't trying to kill herself . maybe she was really scared . maybe she really heard voices . 
sulu ! 
claire ? 
sometimes i think that 's what you want . 
i will do no such thing . 
it 's much more personal in here . 
humans make illogical decisions ... 
hello , lainey . 
got it . 
that 's funny . i wonder if you 'll take <number> <number> and fifty dollars to fuck me ? 
it wo n't happen again . 
let 's get that tent down ! 
it was good . very chilling , but you still got all the points across that we talked about . 
because ... . 
turn this crap off , <person> . it 's giving me a headache ... you may go , <person> . 
yes ... i 'm uh ... i 'm fine . 
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here . 
you would n't consider going over <person> <person> without a barrel ? 
pure ? 
because the rabbits are us , <person> . 
what 's your opinion ? 
it 's not particularly my beloved paris . 
that 's <number> thing i did find . it 's from last month , so it was in the unsorted pile . 
sounds like he knew what he was talking about . 
that 's not true . 
no , no brothers , no sisters . 
how do you mean , exactly ? 
<person> <person> wants the <number> hundred now ! 
but <person> <person> does n't look anything like <person> . 
well , tomorra you 'll get in a full day -- full day 's pay -- an ' we 'll have plenty . 
that wo n't be necessary . i have n't much to say . 
darling , you must n't worry so . 
yeah . 
why are they ... 
business . 
i know . what can i do ? he is the boss . 
intention ? intention , <person> ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the earth . 
then just give me <number> of your explanations that all <number> of us 'll buy . 
<person> up . 
get some sugar too , for the coffee . 
came close this time and it scares you . 
are you having a bad dream ? 
thanks ... i 'll ... go say hello to your mom . 
this <number> i have watched a long time . all his life has he looked away ... to the horizon , to the sky , to the future . never his mind on where he was , on what he was doing . <person> , excitement ... a jedi craves not these things ! 
ok. <person> ... could you just take a look at my radiator hose . it 's busted . 
all right . then let 's eliminate the symptom for the time being . 
okay ! <person> , fuck it ! use the basement ! get off me ! 
he was the <number> behind <person> ? 
that was a very bad statement . the country loved this man , and you have made it hard in general for <person> . 
with a shotgun . it kills him , and it shreads the money . i mean , what are the odds ? 
because that was n't anything to do with me . and suspicion has been cast in my direction . did n't make any sense . choosing those shitheads over me , cutting me out of the deal , then screwing them over too . 
no ! ... yes , a little . you see <person> and my fa ... my father had a falling out ... 
santos ... you kill that <person> , otherwise he 's gon na turn my baby against me . 
there 's no reason . 
it brings out my eyes ... 
has the observer from justice shown up yet ? 
it 's good for me - i know them , i 'm familiar with them . it 's good for you - you 'll be compensated . it 's good for the army . you know what i 'm going to make ? artillery shells . tank shells . they need that . everybody 's happy . 
professor saunders , over in berkeley . 
praise the lord , eh ? 
waking up at the zoo , that 's not so insane . having no clothes on ? that 's insane . what did i do last night , <person> ? 
inside what ? 
... and the government . 
he 's a big one . you do n't want to mess with that particular breed . 
he do n't look wise . 
they could put you in jail . 
thanks . 
do n't be greedy . stay with <person> . 
why yes <person> , i am , and thanks for asking . you do n't have to talk to the intercom , i can hear you fine . 
good theory . but i like my mother . i have no aversions to what she does .

you would ? 
i 'll help you . 
not doin ' them very fine , o'neil . 
i actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it 's been twenty-four hours , and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color ... 
she took off on the bicycle , man . 
uhh ... i with it sister but ... 
any word on the location of the strodes ? 
well , there we 're in a gray area . 
now look what you 've done . 
i 'm telling you , <person> 's lost it . he 's saying there 's a deathwish out for each of us . 
that 's right , <person> . 
he 's a freak ! that 's how they live . we 're partners , him and i , business partners . you 're willfully deprivin ' me of my livlihood ! 
but , of course , there 's nothing self- serving in that scenario . 
stop . 
i think i better go . 
<number> seconds ! you still got <number> seconds to level this beast out ! 
yeah . 
i was kindly needin ' to do some tradin ' . reckon they sell toothpaste ? 
you 're <number> of those skanky old men that , like , attack girls and stuff . forget you . my , um , my boyfriend is gon na be here in about thirty seconds , and he 's way testy . 
of course . i 'm a terminator . 
what do you want more than anything ? 
it is n't right to make him suffer ... 
no , but we 're about to . 
he 's as big as <person> , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he 's probably <person> <person> and <person> <person> rolled into <number> . 
better no general than <number> carrying the plague . 
is there a problem up the road , <person> ? 
you 're the boss . <number> thing , though . 
who i am , outside of this boat . what the hell i 'm doing here .

why not show dr. furtwängler the evidence . it may refresh his memory ? 
a brunette ? ... maybe beat up ? 
tell me about it . i ca n't imagine doing all this and <person> 's internship next year . 
doug , nobody tried to kill you . 
good . so what we 're going to do is march right to <person> 's doorstep . we 're going to insist they take a statement . we 're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they 're walking a fine line here . defamation of character , malicious prosecution ... 
you get out of here ! if any of you men think you can come busting in here- 
<person> victoria . f.b.i . car . a legitimate tail . 
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course . 
i could n't help it ! it was the most fun i 've had since i 've been in law school . not only was i good enough for <person> -- i was better than him . he has to see serious i am now . even <person> was impressed , and he 's a total hard-ass . 
can i see your license and registration please ? 
do i know you ? 
that is not what i 'm -- 
at a press conference . 
no one 's home . checked it out myself . 
oh , really ? you 've got a legitimate complaint , <person> , i do n't deny that . i was n't a very good mother when you were a kid . 
get a boob job . 
- thank you , m. but this is more than your man can handle . are we in agreement ? 
no ! 
i 'm not sure . that 's the funny thing about him . he 's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it . 
uh-oh . <person> ? 
it 's up to you . <person> <person> . new outfit : via <person> and bogot . no catering . <number> hundred and eleven pounds . <number> <number> one . good value , but refueling at bogot is variable .

so you have information for me ? 
no ! 
susan , do n't go ! <person> , please ! 
i forget to tell you . i 'm running blocker for <number> hundred cases of illegal brew .

and then ... what did she do ? agnes what did she do ? 
gopher , <person> ? 
i 'm not hungry .

have you been a patient at county ? have i seen you someplace ? 
it 's just a walk-in bank . you do n't have to be <person> for this <number> . 
fine -- they 're fine . oh , <person> <person> , i -- i want to apologize -- what the papers said i said about you -- that was n't true . i -- i would never say a thing like that . 
goodbye , <person> . 
they are trying to override the access codes . <person> is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and ... 
margo , you have n't got any age . 
i saw your father fight <person> <person> von konigswald , the beast of yugoslavia , hand to hand . 
you 're dangling from the last letter of your last name . 
it 's ukrainian . her grandparents immigrated here . 
i would imagine that we are , now . i think i 'm ready to use the bathroom , finally . 
it 's not a game . something you play . 
athos , the former musketeer , has just fought with several of your guard , at the musketeers ' gate . 
that 's not the point . in the end what spies rely on is the <number> thing they think they know that you do n't . 
oh ay ? 
yeah ? 
yeah , let 's . 
no offense , but all i ever need ... are these ... and this . 
the eradicators ! 
he had his hand on her titty . 
fucking figures . look , are you guys seeing the pattern here ? we got big questions at both of these crime scenes , with no answers . why did they kill the guys in the other <number> booths ? why did he do the bartender ? it would seem unnecessary , even stupid . god , i hate cold crime scenes ! i 'm fucking leaving now . and do me a favor , tell me when the next guy dies , cause these guys are not done yet . 
he 's my son . 
ah , everybody screws up some , brian . you 're working for the toughest lt. on the job . saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building . it 's just bad luck you 're family . 
there are certain meds , certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you 've done , but i 'd have to administer them myself . 
selfish attitude ? i 'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up , not too much foam ... 
i do n't know , but god help him if he does it again ! 
you resemble a figure from the della robia rondels , in your family 's chapel at santa croce . 
... yeah . but <number> 's enough not to look anxious ... 
that is a marvelous image , <person> . because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around . 
come on , sit up . 
i do n't think so . 
well , i ai n't goin ' to china . and neither are you . 
-- i do n't care who you are . you could 've been killed . every man and woman in here has done hard prison time . and we look out for each other .

ahmar is ossirion . `` passageway to the underworld '' , actually . 
hemingway . you ?

do you know how i define `` idealism , '' <person> <person> ? 
it 's just my stupid back . i 'll be all right in a minute ... 
what do n't you understand , pal ? 
a hunting accident is perfect . 
very well . what is it you 're proposing , <person> <person> ? 
rowan ... 
i do n't know . 
and a car . 
if you ca n't redo these <number> hundred miles when you 're rested and ready , how are you possible going to walk another <number> thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition ? 
tonight we open new doors . 
as i said , in every way . <person> and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you <number> . 
my lord . 
pheromones ? 
frankie ... do you respect me ? do i have your loyalty ? 
was that why you did the <number> grand ? i could n't help you . 
when he said it , fifty years ago , he might have been right . but today , war is too important to be left to the politicians . do you follow me , <person> ? 
this is no imitation . removing the hot dog from the ultradog yields a better dog . <person> -- ultradog , no dog . 
well , one must do something to live , you know -- and i have an elderly mother who depends on me . 
[ you are <person> <person> . ]

i do n't know . 
thank you , <person> .

i was fooling , silly . you need a cigarette , because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book , and you just have <number> , and the match is to light it . and you need <number> glass of champagne . <person> pear-igg-non . 
so you sat it out , that 's what you did ? 
my astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- <person> , with <person> rising . have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion ? 
i was watching . 
<person> , this is what intimacy is ! 
yep . 
aww ... he got away ? 
lem me feed you , sweetie , while they hot . 
less <person> ? sure , say it , it 's not a dirty word . sat whatever the hell you want . the writer is king here at capitol pictures . you do n't believe me , take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that 's what we think of the writer . ... so what kind of pictures does he like ? 
i think ... for the pleasure of the kill . 
laurant and <person> were in business with <person> . 
why 's that ? 
is it ! the best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark ... around the world in <number> months . 
he is ? 
sure we could run him . you realize he 's already head of his block association . 
but if you did . 
good morning . what does this mean ? 
i think it 's exciting . 
you 're thinking exactly what i thought when i first saw this house , 
and ruin a perfectly good story ? do n't be silly . 
but that 's simply not possible . and i do n't find this funny anymore . 
i do n't know . i found him lying there . 
why do n't you get us some food . this may take some time . 
of course not ! gods are n't afraid to die ! gods do n't die ! we do ! 
you want me to call you a cocksucker ? ! 
she 's the best poker player you ever saw . my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt . finally , my mother gave him an ultimatum , either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night . he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down , she never lost . she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands . and he bluffs ? he had sixteen levels of bullshit . her eyes , the tone of her voice , her bets , her jokes , the way she sipped her coffee , she was a master . she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game . every saturday night , my father would lose <number> , <number> hundred bucks and she 'd win it all back and then some . and i 'd stand there , glued to her shoulder , from the time i was <number> years old , watching every hand , every move , studying how she did it . that 's why i 'm such a good officer , i can look at a man 's face and tell you exactly what he 's holding , and if it 's a shit hand , i know just what cards to deal him . 
miles -- why so angry ? 
well , your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .

there 're no cars on this street . 
okay , but it 's not a date . it 's a dinner . 
it 's your call . 
tell us . 
it was either that , or a sardine . 
because he said he 's coming to hear us play - maybe . 
you 've been listening to rumors .

the department of public health ...

no , but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from ohio . 
i will alert the chinese delegation . you know , i would never have let you go alone , kundun . 
oh ... well , maybe we better synchronize our spells ... or stagger them . 
fool , there 's a lot in this world you do n't know . 
we could n't have done it better ourselves . 
i came on my own . after reading about the bombing in dallas . 
are n't you a little too young for that , sonny ? 
wait -- listen -- 
call the fbi . use a pay phone . do n't give 'em your name , dad . just tell 'em that it was <person> who killed <person> and <person> and the others . that he 's the nightingale .

you wo n't even tell me your name . what 's shocking about a name ? 
we both know i 'm already dead . 
... it 's gon na be an l-shaped ambush . they 're not gon na open up until they got the party favors , 'cause all they 'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight . they < u > will < /u > wait till they got the goods before they do the deed . 
nope ... never finished <number> yet . i hate these things . 
that 's what he said .

veidt¹s complex . 
the nanobot .

yeah . sure . had me going for a while . 
the whole idea is preposterous ... . 
i 'm sure you 'll win , sir . everybody i know is going to vote for you . i was going to put <number> of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy . 
seen a lota movies . 
pause as he takes all this in i think your dad would miss you . 
you survived and now you shall continue the curse . 
bullshit . getting yourself killed wo n't do the kids any good . besides , we do have a choice . 
but ... you 've done so much for god as it is ... ca n't you do something for yourself for once -- for <person> ? 

the men said , <number> .

where did you learn to kiss like that ? 
how is he ? 
when i 'm sober . they get a little mixed up when i 'm drunk . most of the time they 're mixed up . 
it 's the receptionist at <number> of the places i service video equipment -- she 's very pretty and , you know , she never even talks to me and then today i come in and she 's all `` i saw you on tv the other night ... you were so great ... `` next thing i know we 're ... 
alchemy . 
what kind of show . 
`` ... to rescue the crew and salvage the ship . '' the crew is dead , dr. weir . this ship killed them . and now it 's killing us . 
are you kidding ? you guys 'll he running this joint by then ... 
somebody did it twice last night -- in the dark . 
better get home before it is . 
it 's an alternate version . so what if we have an alternate version ? and i do n't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable . 
you 're probably mistaken about that . let 's get together sand talk it over . there 's always a solution to these problems . but it must be near the water . quite near -- yes , if you do n't mind waiting . 
here they come ! 
yeah ? you and who else ?

you did too say it -- i heard you . oh , i love you <person> -- i mean <person> -- er , <person> -- brian . i hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you . 
you 're damn right you 're sorry ! and you -- you 're the road manager ! you should be watchin ' out for him ! 
is that really what you want to ask me ? 
was anyone hurt ? 
yes ? 
if you believed , you would n't be walking around with a handgun in your belt . what does that tell me ? you want to make the night come down . 
and it 's not only because the trip 's a tough <number> -- 
you know you should n't leave your tv on so loud when you go out . that creep down the hall phoned the manager . 
yeh . 
who 's next ? you ? me ? <person> ? 
he 's got ta still be down here . 
yeah . to watch the world go by. -- 
cinderella man ! <person> , you stuck a tag on that hick that 'll stick to him the rest of his life . can you imagine <person> 's face when he reads this ? 
enough jabber . 
i do n't know ! i 'm sorry ! 
your lord . 
even if she does n't dump me , which is unlikely , she 'd never be able to trust me again . 
just do what i say , <person> . 
i think investment advice from a dead man , it 's a bad idea . how does it feel to be dead ? 
my department does n't have any record of that , mrs. bickerman . 
keep moving -- 
i 've seen it . 
<person> of a bitch . get over here . 
no ! no ... 
what happened ? 
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ? 
does it now ? 
no , no consiglere . not this time . no more meetings , no more discussions , no more sollozzo tricks . give them <number> message : i want sollozzo . if not , it 's all out war . we go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street . 
i do n't care about the intention . i just know your <person> <person> is a plus on our side . i 've seen it come through <number> times . 
duffy ! ! ! ! <person> ! ! ! ! well , where is <person> ? diabetes ! i ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease . <person> . 
that 's right . 
what happened ? 
why not ? 
i 've got a meeting in chinatown . 
what ? 
thank you for inviting . 
out of warsaw . where ? 
okay . 
a heart -- 
obvious pattern -- all ties in -- 
that 's life . my kisses are alive . 
did you kill this vampire who made you both ? is that why you wo n't say his name ? <person> thinks you did . 
tell me , m'sieu laval , what else is wrong ? 
to get on home . 
oral surgery . corrective teeth surgery . 
promise ? 
... you have < u > brought < /u > this perfume ... brought this perfume . back . < u > back < /u > from america . to your new wife ... you have given it to her , and some of ... some of 'her perfume ' has found its way back onto you . <person> man . <person> man , indeed . 
do n't . 
... she 's having a bath now ... why do you want to see her ? 
i do n't understand . what about you ? 
right . 
no , it is n't what i think . 
yes , you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased 's right hand . the report says 'recent origin ' . how recent ? as much as <number> hours before death ? 
huh ? 
shut up ! you 're scaring me . stop ! you 're scaring me . 
i do n't know about that . 
unless he 's dumber than i think , he wo n't wait 'til his lease is up . 
i should think that would be obvious at this point . 
<person> mack , that cop . and jeremiah . and even when he 's done , who knows . he wo n't be satisfied . just like that demon dog . feed it , and it just grows hungrier . feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more . who knows where it 'll stop . that kind of hunger ai n't never satisfied . 
no , no . the <number> hundred is for you doing it to me . 
who 's calling ? 
i 'll give you ten seconds . he is going to give us a practical demonstration of what i feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or i 'm out over <number> hundred bucks -- so let 's hear it for -- 
they must have gotten it from the base . no one else would know it . 
i do n't know -- i 'd like to do anything -- 
homicidal ? 
ca n't help it . what 's the wind like ? 
but then rides up pope pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross , climbs off his papal horse , draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on . and what did <person> , dear dear drunken <person> do ? 
all right . as what ? 
i want to talk about the baby . 
they 'll learn . galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young , doctor . 
what about coffins ? 
-- -and a snake-eye glare , <person> was able to totally psyche out any confidence <person> had . 
and he still wants to marry me ! 
if he comes near you again , i 'll break his neck -- 
ahh , that 's right , like <number> big happy family . this is <person> 's room and uhh ... . 
unbuckle me -- fast ! grab the leader . he ai n't normal , this <number> ... they never -- 
make it stop , it really hurts ! mother ! make it ... 
well , i used to live there . i used to live there for years . you know , but it 's gotten-it 's so dirty now . 
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage . 
shh -- do n't talk . <person> still . 
is it some sort of joke ? like <number> of those hoaxes ? 
`` emperor <person> ... ? '' 
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life ! 
i 'm never going to meet anyone who 's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes ? what do you think ? there 's a perfect woman walking around out there ? 
is that how you remember it ? 
-- hospital . 
you talk in rhymes and riddles and ra ... rub-adub -- - but that does n't mean anything to me , see ... .see ... see i used to be smart ... .i 'm <person> <person> <person> <person> . i 'm <person> <person> <person> <person> from the tv -- 
who am i ? 
i do n't know . all of a sudden , i 'm thirsty . 
those things can be dangerous . staring at a screen all day -- you miss what 's going on outside in the real world . you can lose yourself . you should get out more . how are you going to meet boys ? 
it 's just been empty a while . 
i was n't sure if you 'd make it . 
pretty lame for such a smart kid . 
junior ? ! dad ... 
remember . 
i say we tape him to a chair . 
somewhere where there are no police , and plenty to eat . 
you stand on your tiptoes . 
you shot me and murdered my friends . 
we gave you lots of help . <person> here ... 
it was blank . nothing on it . you gave me the wrong <number> . 
yes , of course . he 's a celebrity . 
it 's registered in my mother 's name . 
listen , <person> , we made you and we can break you . 
their people ? 
you have to karl . you have to look out for me . you do n't let that son of a bitch run you off . 
let 's see -- what 've i got in my cabinet besides mice -- i 've got it -- how would you like to be secretary of the interior ? 
do i look gay to you ? relax . 
it 's beautiful . 
i 'm talking about the heart , <person> . i 'm not talking about the words . 
like it never happened ... 
the kid is on . you 've got me listening to this garbage . go on , turn it on . 
no problem - 
san remo . the police are amateurs . well , my boy , it 's come to a pretty pass , has n't it ? 
getting around , <person> . 
<person> , just -- -- just stay there ! -- just -- 
evidence of what ? 
well , that changes everything . get the fuck away from me ! ! i mean it ! ! 
are you sent by <person> ? 
fuck yeah . i never seen nothing like it . i 'm fucking wasted . 
do n't blame yourself . 
i 'm an exceptional thief , mrs. mcclane . and now that i 'm moving up to kidnapping , you should be more polite . 
things change ! 
i was in <number> . a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree . <number> hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon . was n't so damn funny , i can tell you . 
you really believe that ? 
yeah , maybe some chicks too . heh heh . 
it certainly is . 
that 's good . you ca n't be subtle in this town . 
ok and <number> of them <person> <person> -- she blows a little jealous of bree - you know ? -- bree comes first ? and evidently she knew the freak -- - that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to bree , you know , so <person> 'd get hurt . i did n't know . till afterwards . 
... destry , fair oaks ... . 
aye , sir , <person> <person> ... 
maybe not , ... but you let him believe it ! and then i got ta explain about the homeless ... 
give me the keys . 
what 's the difference ? 
good . you 've got nothing to worry about . soon as the report comes in , you 'll be released . and listen , do n't talk so loud . take it easy . coast a little . 
why him ? 
i 'm fine . can i go up ? 
not a bit . i was all morning in a sales meeting . then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with <person> <person> -- just over from paris . with some spy reports . back to the `` <number> '' for lunch with the harper 's bazaar people -- that 's when i ordered dinner . then <number> fall showings -- twenty blocks apart . then i had to have a cocktail with leland and <person> <person> -- we 're trying to get his next show . then i had to dash back and change . 
where 's the drop ? 
it 's different . he 's a man . and by the way you have no business calling him a homo . 
i do n't want to eat ! and there 's <number> more thing i do n't want ! definitely ! that 's to see you . 
i think it 's gon na be a waste of time . 
a lot ? 
i do n't know-like two-thirty , <number> . 
so , there are rules . things you do and things you do n't do . 
sally <person> is not a bitch - she 's a damn fine attorney ! i 've got to talk to her about this gardiner ... 
he thought so , yes . 
there 's nothing there , you brain- dead cunt . think about it . there 's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything . i want you to hang the phone up , and if you call me about this again i 'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader . 
tom . 
yeah ? 
the bed 's all made up if you want to stay . 
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs . 
fifty shillings . pounds . 
and since we 're talking , my wife and i do n't want you hanging around our daughter . 
it 's perfect , you 've done a great job . 
that 's not a piano ... ..i have a piano at home ... ..where 'd you get it ? 
<person> was part of the gang ? 
really -- 
<person> <person> broadcasting -- -- the nicest man i ever knew -- 
<person> . <person> held up . what are you doing here ? 
monday ? 
the bay does n't . 
where ? 
what do you think , dumbshit ? 
he murdered <person> <person> . that tough enough for you ? 
the word i 'm searching for i ca n't say because there 's pre-school toys present . 
yawing right . 
that you left ? or that you did n't say 'goodbye ' ? 
hold on bollocks , no one but card players in here tonight sonny , and i do mean no one . 
who are you ? maybe i 'll need to . you like me , huh ? 
no pictures , either . 
no , thanks , <person> -- i 'll go up to bed now . 
what is your location ? 
what ? 
... not the bat ? 
no . 
but you 'd have to swear not to tell a soul . i 'm not allowed . 
they know i 'm delivering for you . i mention the half-million -- they do n't give a fuck about that -- they want you with guns . so i say , well , if you want proof he 's getting paid for selling them , let me bring the money in . 
hey the door was open . 
there 's <person> ! hey , <person> ! ! ! 
[ and left <number> more dead men . ] 
nothing to speak of . what is this -- third degree ? 
rodents of unusual size ? i do n't think they exist ... 
unless spoken to , ai n't that right , <person> . did n't you say that ? 
sure . 
that 's what everybody says . but with all due respect , i 'm not the <number> hanging off the back of a ship . 
how are things down under ? blossoming i hope . 
maybe it was <person> ... 
how many weeks are you honey/ 
yes . exhilarating , is n't it ! 
liar ! tell me there are n't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis . 
look ! look ! the front page ! 
and now for that twentieth crack— 
what the fuck is going on here ? ! 
and the baby ? 
i kinda doubt that . we 're grabbin ' a table , send over a waitress to take our order . 
with what ? 
<person> grant . tell me , what kind of metabolism do they have ? what 's their growth rate ? rate of growth . 
<person> < u > shit < /u > , <person> . <person> . 
comes in with a breakfast tray : bacon and eggs , tea and toast . 
that 's right -- you 're the <number> i was looking for . you 'll excuse me . how about you and i being alone ? 
<person> said it in the bible , he said - suffer the little children , i want to suffer like a little child . 
i know what you 're thinking . but the truth is , this other person is not someone i 'm in love with . as a matter of fact , after what she just did , she 's not even someone i like much . so in a technical sense , i 'm not sure you could call me and her cheating ... officially . 
okay . 
could you believe it ? 
well ... you remember <person> ? 
jack . 
<person> <person> would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet . and of course 
torture cage . ca n't stand ... ca n't sit ... for days . sometimes weeks . 
how long has he been with you ? 
ordell , this is n't a bar , an you do n't have a tab . 
you tell me what <person> busted out for , he 's after a lot more than just gettin ' out of jail . and whatever it is , you 're part of it . 
why , you 're the preacher ! 
that 's right . when i saw him on tv , i was shocked . i said to my family , `` that was the man i saw in the truck . '' 
you are scum . i 'll be there . 
well , he ai n't gon na be around no more . 
<person> ! do me a speech , do me a line . 
but there it is ! ... 
yeah , no , it was n't even my idea . 
and how long was it before they caught up with you ? 
where have you been , we had a date for < u > <number> < /u > ... where have you < u > been < /u > ... ? 
yeah , it was . for a writer nothing 's sacred . no , nothing at all . 
-- what ? -- 
i ca n't afford civility , sir . how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when you 've got me set up as an outsider ? even if i make it under these rules , i still lose , because there 'll always be a flag in my file -- `` yeah , she made it , but ... '' i mean , really -- why did n't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base ? 
there ai n't no water in the swimmin ' pool . just a dead tree fell in , prob'ly from bein ' struck by lightnin ' . 
hey , here 's <person> <person> . 
the thing that started all of this . 
tanks ... coming back . let 's go . 
that 's not true . besides , i do n't want you dusting . i want you to see new york . 
how nice . 
but i 've seen the deed . 
yeah , i 'll bet you all were . come on , in the truck . 
that money is my whole future . 
bye . 
i said i did , did n't i ! 
um , well , you see ... 
oh man , you still got a thing for those unmasculine european coffees ? who 's your buddy ? 
call off the manhunt looking for me . i did n't kill the transport guards . 
i 'd say you were full of shit . 
when i can afford to lose . <person> 's quite a magician . 
it 's a surprise . 
<number> and a half days ? 
tell that to the pigs . <person> yet tell that to malcolm . 
she 's beautiful . look at her . <person> , look at her . 
he 's not there . <person> <person> is n't in every single episode . 
it 's getting stronger . 
it 's a ghost . 
catherine , you are a blanket of gloom . wherever you are , the rain follows . someday , you gon na smile , and we gon na declare a holiday . 
no kiddin ' , without a key , it 'll take us a month to crack this thing , 
and if we evacuate , what do you want to do with o'brien ? 
i ca n't sleep . 
you 're crazy ! ! ! ... no way ! ... now you 're crazy ! ! ! you 're completely crazy ! ! ! 
<person> , you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me . 
he 's satan hiding behind the cross ! 
all right -- so it 's buried with you ! 
you said it . 
she 'll do her own . theater training . 
[ beat ] how do you know ? 
you 're saying the thief wants us to think it 's mac but it 's really not . 
it 's what i do . it 's my job . 
actually , i 've been once today already . i 'll stay here with him . 
no ! 
i 'm glad you think so . 
yes ? 
if you hunt , you kill . 
the reality is this : we send far too many men off to war . i do n't need to compound the problem with women . can you honestly tell me you wanted that life ? squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with -- 
well , we were just ... 
shoulda , coulda , woulda ... get him in the water . 
so 's this . hey baby ... oh , nothing . what were you saying ? 
yeah i know . i did . 
<person> was alone in the cabin ? 
no . not really . 
yes . 
you 're telling me you believe the guy ? 
fine ... i want to talk to you . 
no ! 
i heard . 
it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris . be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow . good night . good night , <person> . 
`` angel ! '' i did n't say `` angel , '' that 's a little strong . <person> , here 's the thing , i got ta get over there to the tv station to collect my <number> bucks . 
it 's all right , <person> . we 'll find something to pay <person> . 
yeah . it 's good . feels good .

nothing . 
we 're just fine , thank you , sir . 
how 'bout <person> <person> ? ever do <number> on him ? 
do you have a check for me ? 
yes . 
burgel , i thought it would be easier , as long as i was passing -- 
i 've been thinking . i 've been thinking about us . i 'm sorry i 've been so hard no you these past couple days . i realize now it 's because you 're the only woman who ever understood me and i could n't handle it ! i 've never revealed myself to anyone the way i have to you . let 's blow this town together . we 'll run a bed-and-breakfast in vermont by day , and by night , we 'll dress up and kill anything that ... 
let <person> <person> set you up at long beach . give ya some cash , get that <person> fuck off your back , and we 'll be talking to ya . 
technical ... i could n't help you from that angle . you see , a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off . 
i do n't know how many times i have to say this , elaine , but <person> and i are not in love . i only make love to the camera . 
yes . 
well , i hope you ’ re not too heartbroken and ... 
oh yeah.. 
oooh , very sophisticated . having fun ? 
oh , <person> and <person> had a little hassle and went home . 
open space . she has n't been out of this apartment in <number> years . i did n't used to think it was real ... 
<person> . you know exactly what to do . that is your mission now . 
that big guy lookin ' for me ? 
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part , right , professor ? 
a bank ? 
thank you for coming . i 'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly . 
i do . but you 've still got a problem here , there 's a shark just off the island somewhere . 
do n't you like girls , <person> <person> ? come in , and i 'll show you everything you need to know . 
ca n't sleep ? 
foreign ? and who calls me a foreigner ? 
what do you want me to do ? 
more than anything in the world . 
you said there would n't be any . 
i 'm sure you have n't done anything . have some iced tea . how are the kids ? 
all i have is my personal feelings . i was n't raised with the ideals of the federation . but i 'm trying to understand them now . to live up to them . to live up to you . 
what era was that -- ? 
i don ’ t know . everyone ’ s dead ... 
sovereign . 
but , <person> <person> . 
oh . well , then he 's a truthful whitefoot , of course . 
he gave it to me . 
you should go back and rest . 
well ... let 's say she thinks only about you , anyway ... 
of course it will . remember the big talent show you planned last year ? and what about the christmas benefit when <person> canceled at the last minute ? but you still pulled it off . 
then it 's going to be 'i killed for sex ' ... listen darling , why wo n't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units . you have n't written anything in <number> years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping , there 's not going to be a magazine for you to write for ... 
guy 's been up my ass for <number> years about a fuckin ' job . i had to let him help with the car . 
nva regulars . they 're coming again tonight . tet -- their big -- assault . 
unless the report from the national weather bureau for the district on january <number> goes into the record , i will object to that question . 
yeah . and that 's all i 'm saying . 
i 'm taking up the situation with you now ... 
no . 
for the church ? 
you know , i 'm not sure . i do n't think they 'd tried for kids before , as fate would have it . 
what 's my rap ? 
okay . 
what ? 
before ? ! <person> approved that ? 
he 's right . you shoulda done what he did . go home . do n't talk to the fbi anymore . 
why ? 
we got what we wanted . that 's enough . 
for these prices do n't be particular . that 's all they had - but next week we 'll see ... 
go home ! 
sure , baby -- go anywhere you want . but i have to give you an escort . security reasons . 
<person> <person> <person> , <person> . you ready for this ? <person> was n't killed in the badlands . i ... i found the location . 
of course it is <person> . that 's why they call it a marathon . 
and your mother was a saint . that summer i built the patio at your house ? she made me lunch every day . 
excuse me ? 
do n't i look like i 'm listening ? 
alright , okay ... i think you broke the record for staying in character about <number> hours ago . 
[ <person> ] juliet ! 
... somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits ... 
jesus , i thought my love life was crazy ... 
that will take time . 
just a scratch . i wanted to see you . 
ambitious . 
well , because you 're a - - i 'm a - - 
well ... yah . 
i could accept everything that 's happened ; i could accept it , but that i never had a choice . from the time i was born , you had laid this all out for me . 
yeah ... before your time . 
karen , it 's a pleasure . how you doing ? 
your basic hodge-podge . 
oh . i can type up a storm , but i ca n't spell . so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that 's how i met <person> -- oh , <person> , i 'm so fouled up . what am i going to do now ? 
she washes hair up at ludwig 's - a salon on <number> and <person> . 
listen , it may be a little out of date . you know , i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies ... 
it 's more like a mental block . when i 'm with girls , it does nothing to me . 
city of <person> <person> <person> filled an <number> gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in <number> days . 
yes . what 's up ? 
and his writing ? 
i 'm going to try to remove it . 
you got a school teacher or nancy from accounting , you do n't put on <person> <person> or <person> <person> . you put on ravel . rachmaninoff . but if you got some wild <number> you just picked up at the track , you would n't put on cat stevens or <person> <person> . you 'd put on prince . or <person> <person> . or , if you really wanted to get after it : miles . 
i 've been to information adjustments . they sent me here . they told me you had a form i had to fill in . 
it 's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they 've done something wrong ... or the level of what they 've done wrong . 
he 's ... he 's dead . 
you bet . 
that 's the problem ! < u > nobody < /u > cares about my movie ! i 'm tryin ' so hard , i do n't know what else to do ! 
how do you mean , dr. chilton ? 
yeah . she says we got ta get used to being alone in this neighborhood . <number> , dad . 
what do i have to do ? 
you noticed.. 
not even if it gives you a clean bill of health ? 
my self-respect is gone -- and my soldier 's honor with it . it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man . 
yeah . i want it . 
they have ... 
yes , sir . 
you do ? 
... us . 
with a vengeance , i hated them . 
no . it 's all right . i just meant , it might be a little dull for you , telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere . 
sure i 've been to the cotton club . it 's pretty sweet . but it do n't hold a candle to the boom boom room . that 's where the real action is . 
could you see her ? 
the fact is ... we 'd like you to give <person> another chance . 
it 's none of your business . she did n't have small eyes . 
hey , it 's not your picture on the tv , it 's mine . so , try to be cool . 
unable to escape , she turns and attacks the killer , but does n't connect . 
great story goober , how much ? 
oh , i do n't know , anyroad up , they never are , are they ? 
fine . you want to help <person> , talk to maxie yourself . 
where are you going ? 
oh , screw it ! 
... are you sure you like it ? 
but you are taking it ? 
well , i ... i had n't thought about it that much . i was thinking ... well , it 's an idea , the girl is oversexed , and ... 
so , the guy goes to hell and the devil says , `` do you smoke ? '' the guy say , `` yeah '' ... the devil say , `` great cause tuesday is cigar night , sweetest cuban cigars you ever had . '' 
very good , mr._ ? 
yo , a bad reputation -- <number> years from now people will say 'd'you remember <person> ? ' <number> , who was she ? ' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop . ' <number> , now i remember ! ' ... see , they do n't remember you , they remember the rep . 
do n't be silly . <person> 's a psychiatrist gon na find him ? 
what mr <person> was appreciating was their literary merit , a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming . literary appreciation does not begin and end with <person> . 
<person> ? 
he 's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine . we heard from <person> <person> ? 
he was the first nice guy i ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything . 
you do , huh . 
his stuff comes out of new york . <person> and fetish videos , <person> <person> . definitely not for the squeamish . 
i was making a point .
