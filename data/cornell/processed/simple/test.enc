the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills , right ? and surfers are territorial . they stick mostly to certain breaks . if we can get some hair samples , and get a match to a certain beach , we 'd know which break the ex-presidents surf . you buyin ' this ? 
about <number> hours . 
<person> yero changed-up the drop plan on us . he 's grabbed gina . 
do n't you think he 's too old , though ? how 's his health ? 
actually , it 's more of a policy than a rule . 
oh god yeah . but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs . 
you want to give them something , but they 'll just buy more ripple . and they smell so ... bad . 
so ? so nobody 's going to want to pay for these gatorades . 
a butcher ? 
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ? 
dear , whatever shall we do ? 
going for a pony ride at kiddielands , want to come along ? 
what 's wrong ? 
hey , look . you start paying , who knows what will happen . you 're a good father , <person> . i always gave you that . but you 've got to talk to her .

that 's good then . you 've found something . 
... me ? 
he has a <number> months lease , and has used up a little over <number> and a half months of it . <person> . <person> , but not to drunkenness . pays his bill promptly , with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale . keeps to himself , and none of the neighbors got close to him , or his wife . 
where you from ? 
those boys , those sad , raging boys ... they came to me as the needy do . and like many of the needy , they were rude . like all the needy , they took . and like all the needy , they needed . <person> . i knew them ; they learn in our school . and play in our schoolyard . and they are good boys . 
i assume you 'll fill the ... uh , window , with glass ? 
okay . 
and look who you brought with ! 
no , sandro ... please ... 
i was going to remind you of nothing , least of all that which you know well . your mistake , if i may be so bold , was promotion . commanding a starship is your first best destiny . anything else is a waste of material . 
a week or so . there 's something i want to do here first . 
what medicine ? 
gee , boy , what do you have ? you have plague ? 
who do you think is behind it ? 
the ink on your divorce is n't dry . your children see you on weekends ; your oldest boy , <person> <person> ... was in some trouble with the <person> police over some petty theft that you do n't even know about . 
i 'm getting seasick -- 
smoking is bad for your heart , <person> . 
<person> <person> 's here . look for her . 
i 'll call you . 
i 'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom , birdie dear . 
no , i do n't think you were a fool , i just think you were stupid about it . i mean , to say the least , you outta know better . you do n't know her well enough . she 's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it 's fuckin ' over . you can deny it all you want , but it will not make <number> fucking bit of difference . you 're dead . 
think i 'll have a glass . 
what about <person> ?

i 'm in a hurry , gon na see this great group record at woodland .

you don ’ t take no for an answer , do you ? 
what 's wrong with her -- ? 
hi everybody . 
i 'm very happy .

no . we are not supposed to be backing you up . 
aw , <person> ... . 
what do you mean ? 
uh , ma , you know , no <number> calls him that anymore . <person> . he goes by <person> . 
i 'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel . you guys get to the memorial . keep this stuff hidden . the last thing we need is some over-zealous secret service twirp to ... 
why would nadelman lie ? 
too impersonal . they have to meet face-to-face . 
so you were unhappy ? 
look , i did n't shoot him ! 
and what did you do ? 
i 'm serious , dude . you always seem to be on top of things , even when you 're tweakin ' . 
you do n't need to know the details of this mission ... you 're better off if you do n't . 
<person> ? bushmills . <person> , do me a favor . i 'll buy you a drink tomorrow .

i did n't expect anything . 
yeah -- being a basket case . 
<number> kids tried to set me on fire . 
you guys wan na hear a joke i heard ? 
what are you doing here ? 
lest we forget , <person> , your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than <person> 's . 
next point . friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged . relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden . 
about the ottos ? 
vee fuck you up , man ! 
i 'm staying , jean . 
what was that ? you got something to say , say it ! say it ! 
yeah , but – 
i thought this was a school day . 
lad , you have an unnatural desire to pay for things . it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination . 
<person> , you sure about <person> selling . he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business . 
that 's too bad . get some money , a nice looking girl on your arm , and everyone wants to take a piece . some kid i would n't let wash my mercedes is in my house , shooting at me . <person> , i thought i could make it onto the balcony like <person> . he 's fat , that 's why , falls faster . i 'm trying to watch my weight , and look what happens . am i shot , <person> ? 
but you -- died -- 
yes , she is .

what brings you here ? 
be honest , kid -- am i hurt bad ? 
you wan na go downtown and discuss this officially ? 
and you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that ? 
someday you 'll have a son just like you , jeremiah . a boy who lies through his teeth , buys demonic records , and smokes the dope just like you . 
what was all that back there ? 
oh my god . 
you can have that <number> . 
i mentioned it in my report . did n't you read the report ? 
you said he was no possible connection with <person> . the page girl told you that , not <person> . 
her suit 's gone . 
i 'd be too scared to ask him for it . 
goddamnit -- 
so-so . 
i do n't know , i think ... 
aye . we be on a quest to set the world aright -- 
they do take their time . so..selina kyle ... 
and you say , `` <person> , what am i gettin ' for <person> ? '' and he says , `` cancer ! ''

go ahead , <person> , you can say it . 
lois , i do n't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you 're -- 
of course i fool around . but not so much when it comes to my work , it 's true . have you ever read <person> , or the ambiguities ? 
brian mccaffrey ... oh this is really a treat . <person> <person> . lost a dad to the animal , huh ? 
i suppose you 're right . 
the dispensary . i 'm talking clean pharmaceutical high . a night at club meth . 
well , that explains it . <person> could develop an obsession for the past , with a background like that . 
good night , mother , good night . 
i do n't think that bothered him . 
where 's <person> ? 
but why ? you only owe me <number> . and that 's not till after we close the deal tonight . 
this rig ? phht . no problem . 
we should be so lucky . 
not big in the sense of large – although it 's that too . i mean important . this may be the most important work i 've done . 
listen , what i 'm about to tell you , i 'm telling you in confidence , okay ? have you ever heard of a company called big.com ? 
fine , <person> . we 'll stop in for a drink . 
and how did <person> become involved ? 
you 're not a team player . 
holy mackerel ! 
oh there you are . 
'thief in the night ? ' 
i thought we were poor . 
then why do n't you write about something you know ? write about yourself and <person> . the poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there 's a swell theme . 
i have n't felt like it . 
you give someone a fucking uniform and ... did you hear how he talked to us ? 
little baby girl . 
what the hell are you talking about ?

`` anticipation of incarceration '' ? 
yes , your pms . frida i can deal with that . 
endearingly absent-minded . 
as opposed to ? 
what makes you say that ? 
my man 's coming to get my ass out of here . that 's good enough for me . 
jody and i . and she was there , norman , she was . it scared jody so bad she had to leave . 
hal , switch to manual hibernation control . 
i saw it . <person> got himself jammed in the air lock door . his body held it open . 
of course . 
you know , sacrifice virgins and stuff ... 
give her a chance , will you ? 
if <person> 's loose , i mean , in your script , where 's he going to go ? another age ? another form ? 
oh , perfect -- a <number> per cent family affair . where were you ? 
i 'm an old friend ... i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in -- 
are you sure ?

it 's fucked up . i 'm sorry ... 
well , it was my fault -- the break- up . i 'm sorry . 
but there 's the doll , sir .

i 'm sorry , i was at the theater and i did n't receive your note until i returned to my hotel . 
blast it , i 'm already awake ! 
dude . what are you doing here ? 
only to keep warm . for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night . 
do n't you guys understand ? it 's all about image . the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime . 
when can i see you ? 
yeah ? 
exactly how long has the bijou been closed ? 
he 'll let me stay , mrs. farren . he 'll let me stay .

in case you ’ ve forgotten . i ’ m dead already . 
yes , sir ! 
i know . when the storm hits , it do n't pay to be caught outside . 
do you want to come and have a drink ? 
we ca n't fire , sir ; they 've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive . we must withdraw ! 
that fake < u > inspired < /u > you to loan a guy who 's been fired off his job < u > twenty-five hundred < /u > goddamn dollars ? a guy you say is probably gon na < u > do < /u > < u > time < /u > ! you 're s'posed to be an < u > attorney < /u > for <person> ! you 're s'posed to have < u > good judgment < /u > ! 
i do n't know ... ... maybe it depends on what you were like before you ... 
hello , there , <person> ! [ <number> ] 
i 'm telling you ... 
i fear he may have to . 
i ... 
and you do n't know how they open , is that what you are saying ? 
it 's a free country , you can think anything you want . 
<person> ? he 's been with me for years . he 's not as tough as he looks .

looks like quite a way to go ... 
we all had to write a last letter home . 
it does seem too good to be true , does n't it , <person> <person> ? 
hey , <person> ? 
she 's got information inside of her . i need you to get it out . 
maura ! 
no , <person> . i 'm the one who 's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress . 
franks and beans ! 
did you call the cops ? 
be careful now . unless you know how it works , it 's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ... 
where were you ? 
i 've never heard about you . 
kind of sore . 
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime . 
it 's <number> , i told you there 's no one to pick up <person> ... 
ok , i bite . what does it look like ? 
and ? 
could you handle it if it was in a good cause ? 
who am i thinking of ? 
it 's not a flop house . it 's basic and simple . that does n't make it a flop house . 
some sort of to-do up at the fort , eh ? you <number> were n't invited ? 
frankie . 
today . and now you -- there 's a dog in the van -- 
yeah . <person> with a star . 
did you read them ? 
do n't you threaten me . 
now , why in the hell would you assume that ? 
what kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves , 'think i 'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today ' ? 
some fleet driver for bell just got cut up . just heard it on the radio . 
what college . 
told you it was your lucky day . bet you thought i was just a fan or something . 
it 's amazing , us running into each other like this . maybe it 's fate . 
gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world . 
be cool . be -- 
say , maestro - where were you at <number> o'clock on st. valentine 's day ? 
didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment ? $ <number> a month is crazy , man ! 
i did n't mean with you in it . 
did i promise that ? i do n't remember that ... 
<number> is hardly worth the effort . we 're talking a lousy <number> <number> u.s . 
just giving the facts . 
how would i know ? 
let 's not do the tire thing anymore , okay ? 
i do n't like it when you use the word impossible ; nothing is impossible ... 
yes . 
buddy ... 
you 're sure ? ! 
when ? 
then i 'll take it as a compliment . 
well all right , <person> . he looked at a piano and saw music . the fuckin ' guy was deaf when he composed the ode to joy . they had to turn him around to take a bow because he could n't hear the crowd going crazy behind him . stone deaf . he saw all of that music in his head . 
i 'm a werewolf . 
that was a great idea , shorty . 
sure , like i 'm gon na take advice from you . 
pearl dotes on him . 
<number> games to <number> . but if you know their history , you realize there 's a tragedy in the making . i 've been carrying this franchise on my back since i was <number> years old . 
do you feel much about the things you did ? 
i 'm sorry , too . well , <person> wanted me to send along her best to the <number> of you - and , <person> , i want to thank you for your time and thoughts . 
i never asked them about watergate . i only said what were <person> 's duties at the white house . they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty . 
wow . you know <person> <person> or something ? 
listen with care - this will cost me everything , so you know i 'm telling you the truth ! 
i love jazz . 
well , at this time , i mean that is to say , it is difficult to project -- 
and how will you make him keep it ? 
where are you going ? 
you have to bring this up now ? what ? did i do something here ? is that it ? is it something i did ? 
forget about it , does n't matter . 
rudy , do n't move -- 
i dunno it 's safe to even get out of the car . 
you went to those brain butchers ? ! 
i 've got <number> big ones . 
chief , <person> . 
you ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women 's lib ? 
you know what i 'm thinking ? 
he comes in here every day and we bullshit . he 's used my toilet a <number> times . if i told him no , he 'd know something was up . 
i think she 's pretty , <person> . 
well , she does n't complain much . you know what she 's like . she keeps asking when you 're coming ... 
i can try . 
this is the hot new place , besides , you love pirates . tell me <person> does n't love pirates . 
my <number> friends have my share of the money . i 'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler . 
i ca n't guarantee you what it will be . but i swear on my life , i 'll find you work . 
ammo ! get the ammo ! 
promise ? 
thank you for calling central services . i am sorry , due - 
about <person> ? 
what can i get you ? 
go home , <person> , wherever that might be . 
barks his consternation . 
my brother says the guy 's a thirty- <number> year old virgin , so maybe he wo n't know how women usually feel . plus he 's got bad eyesight , almost legally blind , which is helpful in this situation . plus he 's got an extremely small penis , of which he is `` mortifyingly ashamed '' , so chances are he 'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention , that he 'll be yours forever . 
where are you going ? 
what ? 
aye , i knew you were . 
i 'm not dragging you into anything . i do n't expect ... 
imzadi . this is so good . 
you did ? 
can we agree that that is that ? 
if you actually have news from manchester then ... 
that 's better than gold when it 's cold . 
uh-oh . 
stop it ! 
i 'm designated driver . i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride . 
what 's that supposed to prove ? 
how long have you been running this place ? 
just between you and me , <person> , i 'm going away for a while . 
you see , <person> , i 'm talking about ordinary , everyday reasons . <person> is why i want to discuss your private life . how many illegitimate children do you have ? 
come on . <person> 's get back to the others . we ca n't leave them alone . 
and what did she die of , exactly ? 
whatever the reason , she 's adrift and abandoned . we 've got every right to salvage her . 
i do . 
hey , what do you think you 're doing ? put that stuff back ! 
jesus its huge . 
okay , folks , i think we know how this is going to go ... 
nobody knew me before tonight .

i do n't have a clue anymore . i wish you 'd talk to him . he needs a man . 
oh , right . baking powder , we need baking powder . 
yeah , my pa was n't right in the head after that . 
the bucks gon na stop right here . if my son does n't know the <number> new england states , if he has trouble with geography , i wo n't stick it in his face . i 'll help the little guy . i 'll put him in the car and take him out there . i 'll take him to maine for a big lobster dinner , go skiing in vermont , hot dogs at yankee stadium ... i wo n't stare him down . 
somebody already did . 
yes ? i 'm trying . 
to you ? 
i 'm not . but you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit . 
and who is `` they ? '' 
huntington beach , california . 
i 'm sorry , honey , i ca n't . not today . 
you would n't understand . seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story . 
perhaps some tea ? 
i 'll put you in <number> thirty-one . <person> quiet . faces the desert . 
another coincidence . 
the house is in flames , <person> 's accountant is with the cops , and they 're stacking the bodies like cordwood . 
they 're beautiful . may i have <number> too please ? 
ethan , i can understand you 're very upset . 
luis is a despicable twit . 
better than being caught with your pants down , right ? <person> <person> .

i got that boy coming over here . what 's so funny ? 
<person> , <person> <person> . 
the first thing i learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let 's say you arrest <number> guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you 're guilty , you know you 're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ? 
i 'm so proud of you . you 're becoming a woman . 
i 'm scared . 
all the same entry wounds . it 's definitely him . she lives ... lived here . a prostitute . 
maybe ... i do n't know , if you want to talk -- 
yes . 
you can do it , <person> . 
how 'd he die ? 
marcus ! i did it ! 
the point is , if you unplug me when i 'm flatlines , i 'm history . i got no way back . 
i was born <number> months after she was raped . <number> of the <number> men who raped her is my father . i have no idea which <number> .

francis ? where are you ? 
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away , does n't it ? black nights , fucking black nights , when you want to howl like a dog . i thought i would kill you . you killed my friends , you ruined my hands . but the girl was always here , like some guardian angel . 
it 's bad luck . and i believe hugely in luck . 
doyle , you 're awful . you should n't be that way . 
... he killed <person> ... he enjoyed it ... 
got some coffee brewing , huh ? 
pretty . you know -- it 's funny but flowers only mean <number> thing to me now . 
i 'm just going to get the name of their truck ! 
please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress . under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere chance has allowed me to array against you ... 
it 's nothing . he 's just got a sense of humor , that 's all . 
thank you . when <person> ... 
i 'm cool . they did n't touch the machine . or my disks . probably did n't know what they were . so , you a moonie yet ? <person> ? 
she told me she killed them . 
well , shit-fire , kansas , that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ... 
<person> tired of me ?

you have to leave - 
to whom ? 
a black man gave me the message . 
the stenographer is to go up -- <person> <person> telephoned . 
tough day ? 
no , all the good ones are married . that 's why <person> thinks he 's <person> 's gift to women . this woman anyway . he 's single . he wo n't take no for an answer , but he 's the only one who 's asking . and he knows it . 
you mean , <person> 's father had nothing to do with it ? 
-- there 's nothing new in it -- 
yeah ? 
in your dreams . 
welcome back , sir . <person> was the vacation ? 
no ? i guess we 're not counting lying , stealing and murder . 
you will find a market there for this ring . i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice . 
i do n't want to go to mexico , <person> . i want to be with you . do n't you think i care about you ? 
when <person> died -- it was so sudden -- i was kind of in shock for awhile . then i woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and i did n't have any idea what to do with it . 
he 's got a houseboat . 
your son <person> ?

if i could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way i do . the way it 's going to be . 
congratulations . by crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet , you 've become the third white man ever to hear of it . 
call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock . 
no , i 'm sorry , i do n't . 
remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year ? i did n't think that just because you get an `` f '' that means you have to take the class over again .

'keep movin ' that 's my motto . would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar-eighty an hour , having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you ? i can make more money suc ... doing what i do for <number> minutes than i can all week at another job . 
and as a father , i worry about him . in medieval stories , <person> <person> , there 's often a young knight , inexperienced but pure of heart ... 
little early from trick-or-treat , homie . this dick trying to bushwack me . 
right . the sonofabitch could n't get along without me .

i do n't know what to say . 
tripp ! 
gentlemen , you notice <person> <person> refuses to consider our wishes . he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground . he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith !

we 'll trust in faith , <person> . 
you do n't have to explain . 
we ai n't goin ' nowhere . 
i still ca n't believe <person> 's getting married .

oh , what a chance ! if i could just -- get to him . 
first place , you started it with the french over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio . now you 're sayin ' these people have a fight on their hands ... 
you 've talked to <person> ? 
all right , you want to talk about lies , let 's talk about lies , <person> . <person> 's talk about lying to yourself . you have n't been able to sleep with your husband because you 're no longer in love with him , and maybe you never were . you have n't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember . 
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics ? he 's just a boyfriend , <person> , and in case you have n't gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio , i 'm about to become single again . and yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision , for which i 'll probably be ostracized at both school and home . you ask me who i choose , i choose you . 
how about over there ... that empty memory ? 
do n't threaten me , <person> . i did nothing illegal . 
i do n't know ... 
shhhh . they did n't commit suicide . 
that 's what they call the repository . every magic secret known to man 's locked up in that room . 
she tells me to keep away . she is to marry <person> <person> . what should i do ? 
what ? 
she dreamed this would happen ... 
you 'd better get smart , man . it 's time to walk away . 
it 's not our job to get involved in your personal life , but when it interferes with the training here -- 
chut up ! 
it ’ s friday night , <person> . what happened to your latest boyfriend ? 
that bitch from ... 
nothing ! swear to god , i did n't do nothing !

i 've taken pity on you , my angel . i heard your wish .

i , what are you talking about ? i talked to her this morning , and she said ... 
how long you been up there , <person> ? 
<person> ada ever spoken to you ? 
no , but i work there -- i like it . my dad 's a lobsterman . 

i 'm old enough to be her father . 
anything ? 
fatal fascination of <person> <person> wins out . 
then have the lab check <person> 's head . dr. lecter 's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues ... they 'll find another cocoon . 
taking my boyfriend to the airport . 
you 're depressed that i come along . 
been doing experiments with <person> and soda again ? 
it 's me . 
with what ? 
and may i suggest for dessert , the <number> copies i made ... 
that 's what it says . 
six-fifty . 
do you trust me ? 
yeah , i saw it . 
what are you doing ? 
oui . 
you better get packed . 
it was never pentangeli ... i 've always known that . it was roth all along . he talks to me as a son ; as his successor , but the old man thinks he 'll live forever . 
that 's fine , bela . we 're still rolling . just say `` dear , you 're lovely . '' 
i rest my case . he 's a jewish nazi . he always was . 
i 'm sorry . 
i do n't know . either she has it or the feds . 
if i were married to him , i sure would n't walk out . 
that are called <person> or something , i guess not that many . 
what about < i > my < /i > motive ? now i can say i fucked a us marshal . you think i will ? 
the car does n't vanish <person> . the movie in your head has broken , that 's all . but now i 've re-spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car . 
no i 'm not . i look like shit . and so do you , <person> . you look just awful . what 's with the patch , anyway ? what 'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin ? 
where do we go from here ? 
nothing . just ... all the lights out ... must be asleep . 
she works for them . 
i do n't know . 
for what , the cops ? 
it 's good . 
mmm ... 
no , it is n't what i think . 
do n't let your father 's business infect your life . 
a stereo type alarm system ? 
how do you know it 's love , if you 've never been in love before ? ... it may be friendship ... or the love you can have with a brother or a father ... how can you know ? 
no ! go right ahead , <person> <person> . 
i understand that . but , you know , i think you should try to make the best of it now . go slow , you know . see what happens . 
that was so fuckin ' money . it was like that `` jedi mind '' shit . 
where do they take them ? ! 
are you all right ? 
do i have to tell you ? moss . 
what dares the slave come hither , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead , i hold it not a sin . 
you 're going to be busy all day long , <person> . 
you like shoes ? 
life has betrayed us . we 've found there is no heaven on earth , so we must worship evil for evil 's own sake . we 're not wicked . we commit no violence , unless ... 
i was a little abrupt with you this afternoon , <person> . forgive me . i want you to know i value your advice . 
not anymore , not in the city . 
nope . 
something he said , just before ... 
moved out . 
karl , what in the world are you doing here ? 
you ca n't be too careful . 
wearing them ? or humping them ? 
show me the way ?

my name goes on that report . it 's a half-assed job , i do n't get my doctorate . neither do you ... . 
do n't be silly . what are you sorry about ? 
you were right , i had to get out of that hospital . nothing wrong with me any more . 
just like you would be . 
happened ... yes happened right down there . 
what ? 
for once could you just sit down , shut up , and give something a < u > chance < /u > ? 
i 'm not surprised . can we save anywhere ? 
where does that go ? 
he 's going to be fine , are n't you boy ... ? 
like what ? 
wuddya mean , buddy ? 
you did n't find your patient so frightening in the daylight , did you ? 
you are here . i could n't believe it when they told me . what are you doing ? 
they did n't say an address ? 
what ? ! no , no . you can ’ t -- 
well enough . i have been buying gear off <number> of them for a couple of years . 
what is this ? is this a ... present ? are you kidding ? 
it 's very difficult to put into a nutshell , but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination , where <number> may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world , to any time you desire . you may look over the shoulders of kings , unobserved , battle with ruthless tyrants , and marry the beautiful princess , all in the space of a few hours . onstage you may be whoever you wish to be , do anything you please , and always , always live happily ever after . the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world , <person> <person> . it is lights and music , gaiety and joy . it 's ... well , it 's romance . 
cq what ? 
how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed ? 
dottie ! watch what you 're doing ! 
i think he hired <person> to kill <person> <person> ... it was n't a chinatown gang hit -- <person> <person> and <person> 's wife were lovers ! she just about told me ... ! 
i did n't think there were private detectives anymore , except on tv . 
no , they wo n't . 
it takes that much time to process the order and make sure it 's valid -- 
seven days ? ! seven days ? ! oh , great . oh good - - clever . 
what about <person> ? 
i 'm sorry . i had the television set had the television- 
how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there does n't carry something metal tits ca n't detect ? 
eighty-eight dollars ai n't gon na make a dent , baby girl . 
tim ! lex ! 
<number> for all . all for <number> . 
i did n't mean to make a fool of you .

sir , we are <person> . all except our a-cump- uh , company-accompluh- uh , the fella that plays the gui-tar . 
chinese peony root . 
tarleton has a list of our men , most are on it . a regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list , burning them , killing whomever resists , women and children , as well . 
it 's for my daughter . 
did n't debbie deserve anymore ? 
no , <person> , you do n't understand . 
i saw you play , man . you were good . like a fucking freight train i remember saying . so what happened , injuries or what ? 
okay . 
if you do n't keep your neck in and your nose clean and you 'll never have no trouble down here . 
this tree . here 's where it happened . 
i love <number> things . i love you , and i love the opera . if i can have the <number> things that i love together for <number> night , i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life . 
of course . 
what 's the way ? 
i left my husband <number> days ago . 
... today 's `` to do '' list includes a trip to the mall of america . we need outfits for the `` physical fitness '' number -- 
so . are you ready ? i start columbia next fall . of course , there 's like , a year of pre-med stuff , but – whatever . i 'm really excited . and : <person> gave me a job as his secretary . his poems are getting published . 
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you ... 
yeah . <person> , <person> . 
michael , give us a lift . 
and the vampires of the theatre ? 
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none . 
<person> put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered -- 
why do you do it ? 
how 's <person> -- ? 
i 'll be back as soon as i 've got her far away and safe . we 'll hunt this fiend down together . 
if i ca n't , then you all can relax , because it 'll just be a simple case of me being nuts . 
i 'm a toy to her . 
what ? 
something like that . you are a little undernourished , so after each meal were going to give you a shot . <person> over on your right side please , loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down . he does , somewhat reluctantly . she gives him a shot in the bum . 
know what ? 
and suddenly , <person> , suddenly you notice that they like you . they honour you , suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world , for example . 
well , if i had to guess ... i 'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who 's going to be a daddy of his own ... <person> , do you know what i see here ? 
what 'll it be ? 
you know , darling , this is going to be a wonderful party . 
i know , but -- 
will you , <person> ? 
i suppose it 's however society defines it . 
what ? are you my mother ? 
it does n't seem fair . you 're offering me ten grand in cash but you ca n't afford a decent place . 
not so fast . who 's that ? 
medusa ... what 's this ? some kind of club ? 
then you 're saying there 's no negligence , based on my question ? 
no , i 'm not okay . 
the dauphin -- he 's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by <person> -- the maiden from lorraine -- is n't it wonderful ? ! 
i 've loved you ever since i can remember , long before you married <person> <person> . 
this is not a good time . 
seems like it . 
... the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death . and no doubt god 'll be pickin ' on you on judgement day ... 
she wo n't go to st . <person> 's ! 
this is n't `` piggy-back . '' 
you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle . 
who ? 
well , you have to simply tell me , that 's all . 
not us , i hope . 
what 's wrong ? 
just like old times ? 
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we ca n't be sure . 
die in what sense ? 
no ! 
he coded . they shocked him <number> too many times . i 'm sorry . 
yeah , sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years . 
i 'm doing an interview . 
there she is . i got visual . 
thank you . i love you . 
... first time in my life i 'll be a voice with a body . do you know what that means ? what this could lead to ? 
lawyer here ? 
i still got ta do it . wasting time is half my job . 
why ? 
like you 've told yourself . over and over . conditioning yourself to believe . `` learning through repetition '' - 
i ca n't protect you anymore . 
what 's that ? 
i was hoping for a kind word , little sister . 
what 'd i tell you ? huh , <person> ? what 'd i tell you when you came to me for money ? did n't i ask you not to do it ? did i not say that ? what 'd i say to him ? 
valo massa ... chacha hamas .

yeah , i hated it . 
all right -- following me . 
mom , how else are we gon na see the sunrise ? 
i gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to . 
i need you to look at each <number> carefully ... very carefully . look for anything that seems strange or out of place . anything at all . 
negative . the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced . 
mom , would you say you understand <person> ? 
but even if you were in love with me . 
no . 
hammer , you alright ? 
you know , i 've been living here for almost <number> years . now in <number> days it seems as if i know everybody . when i pass people on the street i want to stop and say , `` <person> , i got a fella . '' 
[ beat ] i do n't know . 
you sound worried . 
and now ... ? 
you do n't need to know all of that . you 're just a boy . you need to think about good thoughts while you 're still a boy . they 'll be plenty of time for the other . 
i 've made the scene . 
you never had the talk , did you ? 
oh . 
i thought you said you were n't a very good liar . 
nah , i need a place to stay . so how do you like being in college ? 
... and , and , and did she ... ? and she did the <number> shows ... 
lem me see that . 
you 're not going to like it in chicago . they wind comes howling in from the lake . and there 's practically no opera season at all - and the lord only knows whether they 've ever heard of <person> <person> - 
she 's just a girl i met on the train . you do n't mind do you ? 
you <number> have a lot of catching up to do , i guess . 
then he did n't send you ? 
that 's a lot of water under the bridge , eh , <person> ? 
i 'm a historian , <person> <person> . only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face . 
now , mack , what 's the situation ? 
since going underground , traces of this in-valid have shown up at the scene of <number> serious felonies . do you need any more than that ? 
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can , they 'll never make it down . he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks . 
like you do n't know . 
i 'd understand if you 'd walked in here . socked me in the nose . whatever . i deserved it . 
you came on a bicycle ? no wonder it 's so late . 
but dr . <person> , all you need to do is -- -- work with this tennis ball . squeeze it for twenty minutes a day . a few months of that and it 'll be just as strong as the other arm ... 
<person> , it 's burt from the front desk . 
if you come to talk about that muthafucka , i 'm gon na get up and leave you sittin ' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha . 
i 'm not . you 're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense -- 
my uncle 's in a coma you moron ! 
i give you my soul ... 
that 's jolly . 
scare me , why do n't you ? ! ! ? you stupid son of a bitch ! ! ! 
and then your stroke came this summer . and you put your property on the market , i believe you said <person> <person> . <person> , remember , is < u > <number> < /u > days before <person> <person> died . and who comes spetember <number> , wanting to buy ? 
now tell me something i do n't know . 
[ when you talked to him , did he look sane ? ] 
it 's good you want to do something , <person> . 
i know what it sounds like . 
[ and as long as we 're talking information , there 's something else as well . ] 
and now ? i mean , murders on your set and still you say nothing ? 
i just need a few more weeks , 
i 'm not . 
very good , <person> . may i call you <person> ? or do you prefer <number> ? 
i 've got him if you want him . 
hey . <person> . 
i apologize . 
honey , i 'm really sorry , i was gon na call you about tonight . <person> 's got a lodge meeting . there 's no way i can get a sitter this fast . 
how much sleep ? 
i think my eyes are getting better . instead of a big dark blur , i see a big light blur . 
oh my dear child . 
yeah , i do . a helluva lot more than i trust you . 
should n't they be there by now ? what 's taking them so long ? ! 
you have to leave the white house . 
mind if you tell me what 's goin ' on ? 
lar ... sometimes when people are mad they say things they do n't mean . 
from that music . 
yes , sir . 
it is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours ! it is <person> 's as well ! 
so , how do you know the owner , <person> <person> ? 
because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30 's . they do n't even like people in their <number> 's . 
i mean , it 's not like he 's saving the world or anything . he 's a sales rep for chrissakes . whenever i ca n't get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day . <person> seconds and i 'm out . but he acts like he 's curing cancer or something . 
i know , but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours . terrible about her father , is n't it ? 
mekong , my friend , mekong . 
because they 're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint . the first thing they 'd do is break my legs . 
so tell me , tell me , i 'm peeing in my pants . 
he ' s confused -- 
at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool . 
it 's a yacht . 
wait a minute . where do you think you 're going ? 
no . 
i 'm quite sure i do n't know what you mean . 
but the good witch of the north told me not to . 
yeah . but i 've got <person> staring me in the face . i think i can take it though ... 
no , i did n't . 
tell me about <person> 's ranch . 
... .this is perhaps an inappropriate < u > time < /u > ... but , i would like to say , it is an honor to meet the woman who < u > solved < /u > the celebrated <person> <person> ... 
parochial school . <person> . <person> <person> 's . 
if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there 's quite a collection down in the pagoda . i 'll see you get a proper tour . 
i do n't care what they 're forming . i 'm on my way and i do n't like the idea of being stopped either . 
yeah , and you keep not answerin ' , too . 
i do n't believe it . 
you get the other <number> when i have my girls . not < u > talk < /u > to them ; < u > have < /u > them . 
is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ? 
oh , frank , you 've got it bad , so much worse than i thought . 
uh ... sheriff ... uh ... 
general <person> , the problem was the terrain . if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park ... we should be able to take him down . 
how come everybody turns out to be a crook ? 
all right ! where 's the key ? 
what 's that , sir ? 
that 's not fair . you 're taking all the fun out of it . 
i was getting worried . who was it ? 
do you know why i 'm here ? 
he 's turned into a completely normal person ! 
hey stud : i thought we had something together . 
locus ! baby ... i 'm here ! 
any others ? 
i should n't interfere ... my mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock ... . 
shut up . our fathers were our models for god . and , if our fathers bailed , what does that tell us about god ? 
so saw my hands off , i left you a present . 
well , i got it , <person> . 
what ? when did it happen ? your dad and i always expected you <number> to get married . 
we get off about the same time every night . we should hang out . you get high ? 
remember our first date here ... ? god , i was so nervous . 
hello , is <person> <person> here ? 
how 'm i gon na relax standing on a mine ! ? 
<person> to interrupt the festivities , <person> , but i think we 've got a problem .

lights ? 
i do n't know , <person> . i ... i want so many ... 
i thought you were asleep . 
i thought you said we were roommates . that we should talk about everything . 
what you get from renting to bachelors . all night i did n't sleep ten minutes -- and i 'm sure you woke up dr. dreyfuss . 
come on . there 's lots of men around here . keep your eyes open . 
pop ! 
well , the light caught the side of his face for a second . and it looked like he had a gray beard , maybe ... late fifties , early sixties . 
ma , you want something to eat , some tuna fish ? 
i 'm surprised he got the votes he did . 
in that case you 'll have to take a civil service examination -- if you pass i 'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue . 
thanks , thanks . 
no you ca n't lose the shot . the meaning of the < u > film < /u > < u > is < /u > in that shot . 
traitor ! she 'll marry you in hell ! 
we all have a past . you have a past , i have a past . and my past is no worse than yours . but you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me . 
look , i 've put my family through enough misery . you got ta kill me ! this way i can leave <number> something . 
<person> missy . god , i was sorry to hear . i remember when she was no older'n ellen there , walking down to the store with her <person> <person> doll draggin ' behind her in the dust . i do n't know why <person> takes someone like her , who should have a bunch of years still in front of them , and lets an old shit like me just go on and on . 
man ? 
i ordered no interruptions . 
sidney , do you have any idea how he could 've gotten your number ? 
i know , <person> , but we 're running for our lives ! do n't you think you could make an exception just this once ? ! i mean , look at the map . the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas ! 
that old pirate <person> <person> <person> personally took this to taiwan when he was run out of china in <number> . peking would dearly love to have this back ...

yep . i guess you must wonder why though , what with the luck we havin ' , but like i always say -- 
it 's done ? 
you 're probably right ... '' people think just because you 're beautiful and popular , life is easy and fun . nobody understood i had feelings too . '' 
somebody robbed the vatican .

they 're whispering . i ca n't hear them , but i know it . i smell conspiracy . i feel the lie vibrating out of the home . 
what 'd you do , < u > build < /u > this ... ? 
first decent idea you 've had in a month . 
i 've got to hand it to the british , <person> . you know what those guys are ? decent . tell me , <person> dr. furtwängler , do you know <person> <person> ? 
<person> ... 
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers . <person> for <number> months . 
you 're a fucking nut . you know that , <person> ? you 're a fucking maniac ! 
yeah , but it 's real close . 
it ’ s not the pin your father wore . it ’ s an exact duplicate . <person> is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company . 
guess i did . 
yes . washington laid the cornerstone though -- wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by <person> <person> -- 
are you going to see <person> tonight ? 
what did he have ? 
did you see the icky black color of her hair ? 
what 's the point ? 
so you hid the truth . deliberately . 
all right –– all right . 
but you know he did it . 
this ai n't about some little soldier girl sloggin ' her way through commando school . the implications go way beyond . 
nice of you ... thank you . 
bullshit . why would mars do that ? 
if you are logical . 
i believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield . surely <person> <person> had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven . 
how 's business ? 
the greatest secret of life is who we truly are . now i must give you that secret , which has been kept from you your whole life . it began on the night when <person> was born . 
mine ? 
you should read the book . i even flagged the `` daddy chapters '' for you . 
well ... well , that 's wonderful , <person> . 
... until our wedding night . when our bodies will join . 
you see what i see , <person> ? 
look , it 's really none of my business but why do n't you just dump this guy ? 
in <number> goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ? you coulda been nailed . 
unless you 'd like to stay . 
i see . then who is after you ? what sins have you committed ? 
stretch it out . 
very well . 
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion . but keep in mind , even the arts are n't free of aggressive content , nor the institution of marriage . 
i beg your pardon ? 
hello , <person> , how are you ? 
i just had a mental picture of ... 
watching what ? 
i ... liz ... all i ever wanted , was for you to be happy . i just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... i just love you so much ... so much ... 
why ? 
when you ... there were pins in my hair ... 
i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will . 
and tomorrow is the fifteenth . and the day after tomorrow -- 
what do you get out of it ? 
that do n't surprise me . if you 're a good observer , you must have observed by now that <person> <person> is a jerk . 
well ... she 's an extremely jealous person . i did n't want her to find out about the girl . 
why would she lie ? 
never mind . wet a towel and wrap it around your head . that 'll muffle the signal . 
-- because a year before , the republicans were n't ahead , not in the polls , <person> was running ahead of <person> then . before he self- destructed . 
it got you <number> years probation . no computer , could n't even use a touch tone phone . 
you got some kind of list ? 
you saw that ? 
hello , <person> , it was a happy landing , i see . 
it 's a mistake . it 's all over . i 'm sorry that we 've inconvenienced you . 
i do renounce him . 
this psycho can . 
zachary . 
with eleven hundred he could come home , and that 's the last thing i want . 
yeah . what a day . 
what 's wrong ? 
woman , what are you doing here ? 
murder <number> ! god , <person> , ca n't we even say it was self-defense ? 
there was blood everywhere , <person> . i saw it , i think i watched the whole thing happen ... oh my god ... 
wrigley ! 
we 're getting that anyway . 
oh , yes . i 'll show you . i have much more colors at home . 
there 's just <number> more thing . 
is n't it true that <person> preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until , by some extraordinary means , it actually began to move with voluntary motion ? 
about twenty-five <number> dollars . 
dad 's disappeared ! 
she 's going to wash your jeep ? 
what ? 
<number> hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of <person> <person> . a parade float . 
found it . 
god , <person> . why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ? 
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan ? 
yeah , well , you know doctors . they sure hate to use that word . 
you think that 's the place she 's buried ? 
like some vile toadstool . 
sentimental fellow , are n't you ? 
hey , what 's up . 
catch that alert ? that 's him in the u-haul . 
i 'd rather drive up myself and ... maybe go into canada after ... and i ca n't stay long , <person> , probably a week , at the most . 
are you crazy ? that costs a fortune ! 
what are you ? a man or a mouse ? are you a punk ? punking out on me ? 
that 's <person> <person> . <person> works at the mill . 
yeah . i guess so ... what happened ? 
i think you know that . 
why the hell would i -- 
i ... 
. . . what ? 
oh , they 'll publish it all right . but that 's not going to stop me - 
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then ? 
no , i do n't really think you 're a freak . 
hello , i 'm here about the ad . 
we 're going to look for him . want to come along ? 
no . 
are you crazy ? what makes you think you 'd survive ? 
consider yourself lucky . in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons . here all <number> needs is a pair of fangs . 
please . when i came here it was for a little adventure -- a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow . but something has changed me -- and it is n't the champagne . the whole thing is new to me . very new . i 've got a confession to make to you . <person> , you are a crook . you robbed the gentleman in <number> fifty-three , <number> , <number> , and <number> . may i have the salt ? 
i see . tell me , <person> , do you remember your father at all ? 
i 'd love that . 
i could eat a horse . 
let him finish , <person> . 
oh ? what 's the problem ? 
what ? where 're you -- hey , where in the hell are you going ? 
agnes , i 'm here because i want to help you . 
did i tell ya it 's great to see ya again ? 
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . very rude . they seem to think we are quaint . 
demolition , right ? 
- looking . 
imf mainframe . 
what the heck d'ya mean ? 
you ca n't be serious . it would not be good to become another husband out of a moliere farce . 
i love you man . 
you ca n't come up here ! 
up ! 
a little what ? 
you know her ? 
you might tell a fellow things , 'specially if the fellow 's your brother , seems to me . 
we 'll start small . when we got 'em lined up , we increase the supply a bit at a time . only sell the best stuff . and keep the price high , 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze . 
<person> ? 
<person> sulu ... ? ... mr . <person> ? ! 
enough . 
i know . a purple heart . 
are we allowed to park here ? 
get up . 
there 's no question . you do n't have any . 
let 's not get excited , sir . 
is he on his own ? 
`` the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill . '' 
-- i know , i know , the pressure 's off the white house and it 's all back on the post -- 
yea , <person> . 
what ? now i 'm working the drop car ? who 's handling the scene here ? 
bonjour ? monsieur ? allo ... 
just take it easy , this is n't my fault . 
headed there now . the same shift will be on at noon . 
it 's in all the papers . 
ah -- no . it 's fine . 
she can out-run us and out-gun us . but there is the mutara nebula at <number> mark <number> . 
listen here , young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it— 
and listen , do n't do anything else crazy , okay ? you all right ? okay . 
sarah , do you think i 'm a loser ? 
we go around once . 
well , when <number> students are hospitalized with stomach cramps i think it 's newsworthy . 
yeah , come on , play it . 
i know he would have wanted me to help you ... and i promised your mother i 'd take you onto the team at information <person> . but i gather that ... 
the chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior senator , <person> <person> . 
yeah ? what happened ? 
feel good ? 
sure , <person> . 
i was gon na wait till the islands , but ... 
i can see that . why ? 
no . 
run , <person> ! ! ! run ! ! ! 
we 're all excited around here . my brother just got the congressional medal of honor . the president just decorated him . 
but i suppose you know the answer . 
we can say whatever we want . we can shout ... we can complain ... look ... the service in this hotel is terrible ! see ? nobody comes ... nobody pays any attention . that 's freedom . 
i knew him . he would never - 
wait ... wait ... i already called him , i threw it away . 
would n't it more properly be done in your office ? 
he 's had his share of `` smacks '' , mothershead . i expect that 's what drives him under the bed . we must use patience and understanding with this man . 
what gives , <person> ? you getting promoted or getting fired ? 
clean ? 
tick . not to dash your hopes , but i do n't deal this kind of product , you know that . i 'll give you <number> for it , cause i 've got ta cut off the last bit . and my customers want uncut . 
name something . 
have n't you opened it ? 
sadly , no . well except for the lint . 
<number> hour ! 
what does that mean , <person> ? i do n't get it . why ? 
which <number> ? 
<person> , mrs . chambers . i hate bothering you ... 
come now . so much anger for such a little crime ? are you sure there is nothing else troubling you ? 
all i have to do is squeeze . 
come on , do n't fuck around , will ya ? 
it was the feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , <person> comes down on n.y.p.d . for some answers - they come up with us . they 're grabbing at straws . it 's politics - nothing you can do . 
isabella ? are you crazy , man ? she almost got us killed . she 's setting you up again ! 
finish , please ! 
no you do n't . 
yeah ... let me think about it . 
what if i do n't have anything happy from childhood ... <person> , i ca n't relax going <number> hundred miles an hour , or <number> thousand , <number> hundred feet a minute ... <person> is over <number> hundred feet a second . <person> hitting something at <number> hundred feet a second . 
what was- ? why ... ? 
stop it ! 
the both of youse , shaddup . 
you never asked me , and every time i brought it up you 'd get drowsy and fall asleep . 
no . 
what a surprise ... 
it 's name 's a christmas carol . 
you do n't understand ... 
this i got ta see ... ... the `` make up an excuse and stop '' part . 
come on , <person> ! give 'em a little third degree . 
so , in light of how the parents feel , and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute , i do n't think i can put you back in the classroom just yet . 
madmartigan ! i ca n't stand being in closed-in places . 
<number> bucks . 
let me get that for you . 
then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock 
gosh . <person> , <person> ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves . 
... also , my rug was stolen . 
as in the textile logues . trying to shrug off the dress . i travel under my mother 's name , too . 
was it ... a rat ? 
excuse me , <person> <person> <person> ... katrina is not in her room . 
captain , this is the garden spot of <person> <person> <person> -- 
we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creature 's nest . 
is anything wrong ? you look a little shaken up . 
truman , that was our house ! 
poison emergency . 
you think we should take that chance ? 
he 's seen both of us now . 
we 'd only just met . 
we ca n't help *what* they were ! forget 'em ! 
i mean , what are the <number> terrors of the fire swamp ? <number> , the flame spurts . no problem . there 's a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that . <number> , the lightning sand . but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too . 
a dime , <person> , a dime for a cup of coffee ? 
since we 're just starting out , i thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . after that , we 'll ... 
he had an accident . 
for what ? for my tie ? 
get the presents and do the lights . 
no . 
sort of ! 
now what is it ? where 's the fire ? 
no . <person> 's a bust . he 's loose . 
yeah , i have n't figured out the plot yet , but it 's laid in a siberian village . 
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt . 
our first caller is big black from brooklyn . go 'head . 
why ? 
what do you need that for , <person> ? 
in new york ? 
from a slipped disc ? that 'd be a first . 
i did n't really do anything -- honest -- i mean , you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you 're serious -- marriage-wise . 
you bust outa jail , <person> ? 
this is n't friendship . 
he did n't have my lawyer . 
the things that get you excited . 
shall we go away for a couple of days ? 
you 're <number> of them , are n't you ? a fucking pro . 
wait , wait ... wait a minute . <person> was here ? ! 
forget it . 
why do you do that ? 
that was lucky . 
go have fun . not too much . 
taking it down the hill . 
yah . 
beats the hell out of me . 
no . have you had any experience with that ? 
you got your stuff ? 
your mother says you tattled on me , boy . she says you told her that i asked you where that money was hid . 
emily , you 're being - a little unfair - you know what i think of <person> ' behavior - about your personal lives - 
he 's not treating her right ... 
and you still believe he 's going to come here ? 
who ? 
i had the craziest dream last night ? walter and <person> had asked your boss to ... 
i do n't think of us that way - ever . 
what 's that ? 
we 're dead . we 're dead , we are dead ... what are we going to do ? ! 
but not tonight . 
here 's my theory . <person> , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son-in-law is involved . 
you get it straightened out ? 
you 're not . we 're level . look at the instruments , we 're okay ! 
come on , <person> -– mesas ? the worst they might do is get a judgment against you , uttering a bad check . i ca n't imagine you want that to happen , man in your position . 
let 's roll - 
in the private aircraft hangar . anybody could have walked in . 
usually , in adults , it 's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ... 
i thought you liked them . they liked you . 
you are something we do not have in russia . 
... <person> 's job . 
i do n't remember . but off the top of my head , i 'd say black . 
i 'm sending you the files . 
that was my father-in-law , who has a wrong idea in his head . <person> , <person> , there 's a question i want to ask you . and i want you to tell me the truth if you can . why do men chase women ? 
<person> , i 've been meaning to talk with you . it 's nice you 've been spending so much time with me , but ... 
no roger from op/ed ? 
i do so love you . what do you smell of ? 
you picked that up on the scanner . we got ta move . 
no , you dump the van , meet me at the airport . i 'll take <number> of ripley 's cars . 
i know that 's what you 'd like us to believe . but i got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter . not to mention abduction . 
think the iraqi 's killed them all ? 
course , she settled down nicely . 
is n't <person> <person> back from lunch ? 
in amity , you say 'yahd . ' 
yes ! you shall . of course you shall -- 
what are you talking about ? 
lady , i got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and i could enjoy this family restaurant ! 
you 're the memory guy ? 
-- fifteen phone calls -- 
i guess she 's busy . 
reach for the limit i always say . 
`` drove down the highway there was a big jam the family had died there inside their minivan there was a backup it went on for miles but as bad as it was it was gone after a while '' chorus here . `` you may think there 's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see to be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be '' 
i 'm fine . i 'm fine , i just wan na keep playing -- 
yeah . right , uh-huh . i feel like i 've discovered this whole new side of me . <person> is so expressive . 
our equipment has arrived . 
come on , <person> ! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you did n't care who it was , any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and <person> fucked your way through , looking for a husband ! or the class before that ! 
it would be too much for him . so please let him think as he does , that you 're home just to see him . 
no ? 
then you must be at least <number> years old . 
you know , new hell really only needs <number> new satan . 
for <person> , schmuck . bring your kid something . you know . the dad thing . 
are they fighting ? 
what else ? money . 
<number> years . 
chancellor , may i present commander spock , whom i believe you know , dr. <person> <person> , chief medical officer , <person> <person> , chief engineer ... 
they 're like any others but they 're special to me . you got kids ? you told me ; you got <number> . 
let 's go , <person> . 
come again ? 
no . i have children , grandchildren too . i visit when i can . but now that <person> <person> can not be left very long , i do not get away much . <person> <person> <person> . there is much good in him , but he will suffer the fires of hell . very sad . 
probably because it sounds scary . * 
you have no right to blame <person> -- 
last night . you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave , did n't you ? 
hold your tongue . you do n't have that much love . 
all right , yeah . you got that thing for me ? 
ai n't that cute ? they got his and her pig-assos , son . 
that 's ... 
that won ’ t be an issue , believe me . i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant . no offense . 
sit ? 
come on , hamilton . you 're going over there to represent <person> <person> <person> and chips . we have stores all over southern california . part of our image , part of our appeal is in our uniforms . you know that ! 
well , if you wan na work in the post- office you 'll have to stick out your tongue . 
you never met a working girl before , have you ? you think i like sucking off guys all night ? maybe i do . so what ? you ca n't even say it , can you ? 
you may , of course , keep your weapons , but i must warn you that ...

what the fuck ? 
... i suppose . 
i do n't want to intrude . 
but -- why ? 
i 'm sorry i 've been acting like a jerk . i do appreciate what you 've done for me , and i know you 've done it for the best possible reasons , and i do love you , even though i act like i do n't . 
now , now . he 's a good boy . 
sold in marriage and half way to america . 
you know , he 's not an enemy trying to evade you . he 's just an animal . 
i 'm ready . 
let her go . she did n't kill anybody . 
all i 'm doing is feeling lousy about it . i do n't know what to do . what do i do , kit ? 
i ca n't hear when you 're nodding . 
c'mon . i bought 'em for you , to make up for that night . 
what about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that ? 
<person> 's far from a slut . 
i do n't like to come here , <person> . every time i do , your mother comes in and makes remarks . 
not at all . i was n't around much ... so why did i get married ? well , i thought it was a good idea at the time . have a home base . <person> . you can get lost moving around so much . 
he 's gentler than i thought . and he has a sense of humor . 
do n't . it 's horrible . 
a little late for that , <person> . he 's asleep . <person> <person> ? 
but now you 've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins . a subject on which you 're dangerously ignorant . 
i got to ask you and <person> to ride to the state capitol with me , <person> . 
look how full of yourself you are . 
well , i do n't know if we want to buy all $ <number> worth ... 
i do n't know why we have to watch t.v .

i want you to know how much i appreciate what you 've done . 
some woman is going to want me to do it to her and i 'm not going to know what it is . 
easy , it 's an innocent question . 
are you okay ? 
i do n't carry it with me . 

surprised ? 
and you ... are you not also afraid ?

<person> .

we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except `` cnc '' -- course not completed , no explanation required . theoretically , it does n't hurt your career , but people always wonder about things like that . 
take care , <person> . 
i do n't want to talk about it . 
i see . 
my lawyers will be on the job in a little while , and i warn you people anything you print about me you 've got to prove . <person> wo n't stand for --

it 's not a guy ... 
careful , chief . i do n't think you know who i am .

that 's swell ! 
we 've also been informed that the grand jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs . 
well , there it is , is n't it ? you do n't even like them , and you 'd sleep with them . what 's that all about ? 
i-i-i-i-it 's all right , fellas . <person> , what 'd you do , come by way of the panama canal ? 
<person> m .

cereal , man , you owe me a pack . 
i 'll buy her a less expensive dress , so i can have some money left over to take her out to dinner .

why did you continue to see him ? 
i spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist . i should have been here at the hospital with my brother , but i was with you .

you come near me and i 'll blow us all up . 
well i have to come up with – an outline , i 'd guess you call it . the story . the whole goddamn story . <person> to nuts . <number> acts . the whole goddamn-

he said you did n't have <number> . 
debbie , think back ! i 'm <person> ... remember ? remember how i used to let you ride my horse ? tell you stories ? do n't you remember me , <person> ? 
britain chooses not to . 
you will not believe it . 
what took you so long ? 
if they thought it was lost at sea , they probably just wrote it off . 
i never heard of a <number> . 
at home alone - where were you ? 
can we stop for cigarettes ? 
it 's not fair , <person> . i can take the insults ; i can take the name-calling . but i ca n't take the losing . i hate it . 
... you should have seen your father , standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce . he looked like such a dope . 
it all comes down to ideology and they 've lost theirs . if i 'd been here <number> years ago , maybe they would n't be in the mess they are today . 
is <person> back to earth yet ? 
things do change . 
hits been hard thinkin ' about it . they ai n't a day goes by i do n't think about it . i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see . <person> makes me sad , too . i have bad thoughts on it . i wished they was somethin ' i could of did , too . should n't no bad things happen to childern . all the ol ' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that 's growed up , the way i see it . i should n't of told you about that . a boy ort not hear about such things . it just kindly come out .

they want my money , they can deal with me . otherwise i 'm goin ' to a professional . he points at a briefcase . 
why point it at me ? i 'm the real thing . 
no further questions . 
you 're not listening -- 
i hired them to . we 're in my brain . but i want it to stop , before i wake up and do n't know you anymore .

i 'm right here . i 'm fine . what 's the dog 's name ? 
you never miss a trick .

you ruined me ! you destroyed me ! 
let 's get naked . 
bad experiences . 
god damn you ! !

now , worker , you shall take me back to the colony , and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole ! 
what exactly you doing , <person> ? 
you have to lay it on the table . 
no .

but <person> , iranoff , <person> ... 
how 's this a plan ? how 're we gon na get a car ? 
what is this ? 
i 'm a nurse . i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital . dr. <person> 's on staff there . 
move it . 
he was so brave . with courage alone he nearly won . 
hmm . to protect you both from the emperor , you were hidden from your father when you were born . the emperor knew , as i did , if <person> were to have any offspring , they would be a threat to him . that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous . 
you come back after being gone almost a year , and you expect me to just leave ... this was < u > our < /u > home , now it 's < u > my < /u > home . i ca n't leave . you can stay with me , and believe me , i want you to , but to just take off for the wrong reasons , i ca n't do it . and you should n't either . 
you 'll *what* ? ... come on , pa. come on an ' whup me . <person> ' try it . 
give all the guys in your crew a piece of that ? 
you broke some . 
and you 'd hate to think you were common . my , would n't that sting ! well you 're far from common , <person> <person> . all you have is the fear of it . now please excuse me . good day . 
no . 
she 's not with you ? 
sir , i understand what you 're doin ' , but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner . 
you 've got to help me to remain faithful . 
aaagh ! 
you 've used up your grant . the electric bills alone exceed your annual salary . not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel . 
keep it between us girls ? 
i 'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own . 
who 'd you kill ? 
do you have everything ? 
i said i 'm a dying man ! 
<number> ... c'mon , <person> i do n't have all day . 
wait ! 
it 's at the vet 's . the kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen . icepick or an awl . 
thought of everything have n't you . 
sometimes i think i do . 
keep it safe . return it to me when we are together again . 
what would you say if i told you that you were going to the homecoming dance tomorrow night ? 
yeah . so how are you ? 
yes ? 
tell mrs. mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there . then if i do n't show , take her down to the boat . 
the inspiration . 
must be hundreds of these skeletons here . 
kate ... 
okay . be careful . 
in any event , whatever occurs you do not belt anybody . 
oh , sure . here . anything else , <person> can get you ? some more chicken , perhaps . let <person> check the fridge . 
no one 's ever asked me that before . 
so right now there 's little replicators spreading throughout <person> 's lab ? 
i 'll be stayin ' overnight at ... the airport howard johnsons ! 
they had a pattern to follow ... 
you could have warned him before you shut him off . 
so , we get back on that rock and in <number> days we 're dead anyway . 
are you all right ? 
that 's impossible . 
recruited you from where ? 
he is <person> and nothing else . why would he want to murder the girl ? 
something simple . a fur coat over a nightgown ... 
you have to believe to have faith . 
there is no escape . you must join me or die . do n't make me destroy you here ... the emperor is strong with the force . but if you join me , together we could overthrow <person> . do not resist . it is our destiny ! 
but , i did n't ask him to kill . 
i am . i 'm helping him with the sale . 
we were very close . 
i came here to warn you that , by threatening danger , your planet faces danger -- very grave danger . i am prepared , however , to offer a solution . 
never mind that now . i also need some artillery , you know , a couple of sawn-off shotguns . 
wes , we thought you were dead , and we thought we were next . hanging around to get killed would n't have done anyone any good . 
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision . 
so what are you thinking ? 
we 'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then ? 
so you left her ? just like that ? 
you wan na disrespect an officer of the law ? 
you 're gon na fuckin ' kill her . take it easy . 
what happened ? 
mimi ! 
oh , you 'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- good morning , dr. fettes . 
yeah , well . i 'm working on that . i 've got something going . 
you should . you can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that . very informative . <person> and watch it with me . 
what do people do in the afternoon ? 
at first , it does n't hurt at all . that 's shock . then it hurts terribly -- you would n't believe such pain could exist -- and <number> months later you ca n't remember what pain felt like . it has n't taken <number> months this time . it has n't even taken twenty- <number> hours . is that a beastly thing to say ? 
colonel , sir , mrs. washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner ? 
he loved her . 
<person> <person> <person> buy something you wanted ? 
then why ai n't he dead ? 
thank you . 
is that why you drive this car ? i take it that you see <person> 's assassination as a special kind of car-crash ? 
but you took off your captain kidd uniform . 
what was that ? oh man , you have picked up a few moves since <person> <person> <person> <person> . 
i thought i 'm not supposed to sit with the customers ... 
there is <number> other thing ... 
<person> , son . <person> . 
i loved you since the day i met you , and i have n't stopped . 
`` mocky-lock is the bogeyman . mocky-lock wants me where i am . '' 
got ta get home . how could she do this to me ? how could she not care about what we meant to each other . what a fuck ! what a fucking monster she is ! 
there sure is . 
is that what she used to sing ? 
that was just a mix up . 
how many wings have they got between them ? 
we do n't hang them at home , y'know – just in the streets.. 
is that why you did n't write anything else ? 
i thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning ? 
... but all the decision of that officer ... 
what do you want to do ? 
do you know he wo n't expel him ? 
what exactly are we going to do ? 
well ... i do n't know , suddenly , the make up ... all this ... how are you ? are you ok ? 
alrlght , alrlght . what happened today ? 
ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you . 
oh ... yes ... ultraviolet protection . thank you . mister ... ? 
we actually got a phone call . busy morning . 
you 're dead , you 're fucking dead elias ! 
you think he 's got any herb ? 
would you stop saying that ? i need you to do me a really big favor . 
is he straight ? 
go away , i do n't want you here . 
you do n't understand a thing , do you , <person> ? 
it 's ok ; i 'm sorry i called you a failure . 
i 'm just curious . i saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand . can you do that with both hands ? 
we understand you , <person> <person> . 
i ca n't believe it . these sound like < u > my < /u > problems ! 
hey ! -- you 're tickling me . 
you know champagne makes me do crazy things . 
<person> . 
if it 's a lie , goddamn her . it it 's the truth , goddamn me . god , i hope that 's witty . <person> 's your mum ? 
make that sixty and i 'm docking your allowance for <number> weeks . 
i 'm going to play poker until <number> a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery . however , if you 'd like to operate on him yourself right now , be my guest . i get the same dough whether i work or not . 
government . recently retired . 
well done , commander . 
what do you think ? 
you 'll be ready for a trial run in <number> days . if your splices hold , you 'll use <person> to trace the a.i . 's coordinates . 
if you 're going to insult me -- 
you 're here 'til what time ? 
where are we going ? 
my ticket ? 
mexico ? you going to mexico ? 
you see , you knew the answer all the time , general . 
i 'm not accusing . i 'm asking . do you ... do you find me too ... too giving ? too-too-too competent ? too-too , i do n't know , disgustingly perfect or something ? 
i have nothing more to say . 
is that what you 're calling it ? 
a kiss under the mistletoe . <person> can be deadly , if you eat it ... 
you 've got it all figured . 
okay . 
how can you be sure ? 
pretty well . 
of course , i do n't know , but i think it 'll get darker before it gets lighter . 
it 's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil , the less evil it becomes . 
no . 
look - there 's <person> , the poet . 
yes , i do n't want you ever to leave this house . 
i should be better by now . 
you mean the snake ? 
oh , come on . what is he ? fifteen ? 
we 're fucked . 
i ’ m impressed . that information could have cost me <number> . 
yes . i talk of dignity . the anglo bosses look down on you , and you hate them for it . `` stay in your place , you dirty mexican '' -- that 's what they tell you . but why must you say to me , `` stay in your place . '' do you feel better having someone lower than you ? 
that 's how a man would do it . i 'm not a man . 
how 's life treating you ? 
i can use <person> 's car , dump it in lake michigan ... i need plastic bags ... tape and rope ... 
it 's good for me - i know them , i 'm familiar with them . it 's good for you - you 'll be compensated . it 's good for the army . you know what i 'm going to make ? artillery shells . tank shells . they need that . everybody 's happy . 
balint ? 
and the united nations ? surely ? 
very realistic . 
but , <person> , i would -- 
almost a year . 
of course not -- -- but is n't it a coincidence that he 's from the eighteenth precinct -- where they made the squawk ? 
what is it if it ai n't a curse ? 
no sense at all . i 'm a little stressed . 
no , i have n't seen him in a few weeks . 
how 's that ? 
but see , he stopped before i got that feeling , that 's why it seems weird to me . i mean , i 'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile , and i would except it never occurs to me , i 'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself . 
ungrateful little yuppie larvae . after all we did for this city . 
that 's the rumor on the street . 
that bad ? 
how are you , honeybunch ? 
i 'm aware of my responsibilities , <person> . 
... this is <person> 's computer . 
let me get at that typewriter and i 'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write ! 
well , i 'll admit i do n't see any flies on her yet . 
i do n't know . i 'm not sure . 
so they tell the kid to throw the world series , or else , huh ? 
did you give him a gift ? 
and ... spencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier <number> . 
bad is bad , <person> . there ai n't no sense to it . 
and when they shot me father ... 
i know . but if it is a trap then why are we going ? 
what makes a man like <person> , <person> ? what makes him do the things he does ? 
of course , they have the same chance . they can look at me like a bug under glass , if they want to . 
a man scared me . 
we shall want a full autopsy ... 
yo ' bleedin ' inside , man -- get that doctor . 
<person> data , i want to know the exact date and time . give me a damage report on that missile silo . 
why the hell are n't you in school ? 
be careful . <person> <person> requires discretion . official business is difficult enough . do n't let personal feelings make it worse . and i do n't know ... even this poster ... could be some sort of trap . 
get real . i 'm faster than you . 
no . 
there 's no 'unless . ' no one has said `` whoopsidaisies '' for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets . 
she thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head ... that i might have done something . she said that to me last time ... when it was ... <number> years ago she walked out the door , `` you touched me wrong ... '' `` i know that . '' some crazy thought in her , in her head ... 
agnes , you 're ugly ! ... what do you say ? of course you do . agnes , you 're ugly ! ... what do you say ? 
n'it 's a crying shame . but you < u > staged < /u > the oscars ... 
london ?

why ? 
oh , yes , sir . 
call tomorrow . it 's okay . good luck . i hope you can sneak out okay . you 're going to wait until she 's asleep ? 
in the middle ? you 've got the mask , why do n't we have him ? 
bye-bye , boys . 
no question , no , you 're right . we got ta do what 's good for us now . 
i buy that . 
wow ! look at all these creeps ! 
my lord ... what are your orders ? 
there 's another choice . 
good luck.. 
use more ice . 
i do n't know , it just happened , i guess . i did n't mean to . 
the case..with the stones ... where is it ? 
i 've got <number> bucks that says someone dies here and now . 
tell him to shut up -- 
oh , <person> , really ? 
i hate the press cases . especially the weird press cases . where you going ? 
the past <number> months . 
they had us tied down during <number> of their house raids , you 've seen the headlines , and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gon na kill us . 
what do you want me to say ? that i thought i 'd done a great job but it all turned to shit ? that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did ? 
no . do n't stop . 
what about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? there must be something to connect him with a past . 
i 'm busy . 
is it fresh ? 
there 's a new potion -- he said it was perfected . 
it was just a little going-away gesture . 
you will live . survive . 
yeah . why are you asking ? 
my wife is going to have a baby , and ... 
we got the permit . 
i do n't know if i want to . 
hope not . 
you should n't hang around this neighborhood . 
coral grows at a rate of <number> and a half centimeters a year -- 
at least you 're honest for once . so now you want to be my friend ? well , let me tell you something , claude-my- shit-don't-stink-banks . you got a lot to learn about friendship . 
why has this happened to the world ? why is it winter now , and dark ? 
do n't tell me -- 
no ... you stay in the room and make sure he does n't leave . 
got a job for me ? 
is n't that her picture ? 
you would n't know it . it does n't matter . what 's the difference ? 
do n't want any of those looks , col . they do n't mean much . 
what the hell happened ? 
what 's in those files ? 
<person> ? 
okay . 
i have to go now . 
... what ? 
to say `` i 'm going on my own . '' 'cause what you do , <person> , let me tell you what you do : you find yourself in thrall to someone else . and we enslave ourselves . to please . to win some fucking toaster ... to ... to ... and the guy who got there first made up those ... 
do n't they have lifejackets or something ? an extra boat ? 
nell ... please , <person> ... take a deep breath ... 
the truck ... the truck has severed most of her lower half . 
<person> . 
yep . you 've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer . 
cause i 've been doing this thirty years and if i do n't know when something does n't feel right by now -- 
yeah . 
you got your mind right , <person> ? 
i 'm afraid not . 
hmmm ? 
& lt ; & lt ; we were there to buy a man and take him back to hungary. & gt ; & gt ; 
what 's that , peanut ?

then what are you doing here in bodega bay ? 
'please remember that dr. <person> risked his life to help anyone who asked him . i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help . he never turned anyone away . after he heard me play ... i am a violinist ... he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden . he helped countless people in similar ways . ' 
fisher , let him talk . 
<person> orbit , <person> <person> .

if i make it through the day . 
maybe i should come back another time .

maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow . 
i nearly died when we split the bill .

hey , chili . get your coat , but do n't piss the guy off , okay ? it could get complicated and we 'd have to call <person> to straighten it out . then <person> gets pissed for wasting his time and we do n't need that .

you 're all packed . and here 's your bus ticket . you 're on your way back to st. anne 's . 
<person> would n't kill for it . besides , who would pay him ? 
i did bianca a favor and it backfired . 
i do n't want it anymore . 
this is <person> 's personal sword , a great hero 's weapon ! he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it . it 's too fine a gift . i can not accept it . 
i cashed in all of my money , paid my amex card , gon na sell the car tomorrow . 
belinda 's a very jealous person .

i do n't understand this ... i do n't understand this <number> bit . he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby . <person> ' bad has happened - i jus know it . 
you 're what ? ! 
he 's getting his cloak back . we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes . phaser banks are down to <number> percent . 
i live in a one-bedroom apartment . what exactly does your husband do ? 
who is this guy ? 
the letter i sent .

i 'm having a blast . god , that sucker teed off on it just like he knew i was gon na throw a fastball . 
i 'm going back to the hotel . 
he 's right . i should go first . 
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date , you never asked me out ? 
no . 
i 'm leavin ' the place to <person> . 
sure , sure . i 've heard it before . 
is he <person> <person> i do n't know , verbal . it seems to me that <person> <person> is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but i know <person> - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . stay here and let us protect you . 
flown ... and that 's the last you 'll see of them ? 
homicide . 
i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american . 
because you felt like a runner , did n't you . 
this is very interesting . we are born knowing our history . we have other books . but not a book like this . 
it 's very simple , <person> . very simple , the xk101 rocket . it 's nothing , <number> years ago we in the fatherland were working on this . <number> more years , we would 've had it . but then -- -- that silly war ... why , my cousin <person> had already -- 
oh . 
yeah , brothers are lined up at my locker . 
i 'm sure he was n't sleeping . 
well ... 
she went . 
how much longer ?

i know something no one knows . he has had his finger removed . on his left hand . it left a scar . 
<person> <person> panicked ? 
oh , it just ended , then . 
what am i -- a security guard ? you hired me , you and your selectman friends . 
i 'd be glad to , <person> <person> . i think i 'll have somethin ' to tell you soon . 
i mean , you blew off our date at last minute . 
forget it . 
of course , dear . you 're home now . 
that sets it off . 
yeah , but that 's not what this was about . they were fuckin waitin ' for my ass . they knew i had that money , they even knew the amount . the one who searched my bag , from l.a.p.d. , <person> , hardly even looked at it . `` oh , i 'd say there 's fifty <number> here . what would you say ? '' but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs , and i could tell they did n't want to do that . 
i changed my room at the hotel . 
you ca n't put her out , i promised ... <person> , you 've got to see her , she worships you , it 's like something out of a book- 
is there a fuckin ' point comin ' up anytime soon ? 
take me away ... 
i 'm sorry to say that our time is running short , but before we close , i 'd like to ask <number> final question . what sort of gardener , sir , would you be ? 
we never met . that 's why . 
it is a nice piece of writing . 
life is good . 
go , go , go , jump ! 
well at least i have an objective wall to bounce this off . you believe it 's possible to dream about what 's going to happen ? 
what is going to happen ? 
i know every face in here , respect for the unknown actor i suppose , myself included . if you 're looking for <person> <person> -- 
jesus . small world . where 's the photographer ? 
it 's been a while since ... 
the guy was a total fruitcake . 
them 's the breaks , right ? no war stories for this pup . 
yes , thanks . 
no look , really , this is n't nescess ... 
i do n't give a hoot in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she ca n't stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it ! 
i did n't follow you ! 
... i do n't know . 
but your people ... <person> ... rocco ; you do n't think ... 
besides , every wholesome thing he might desire , he has at charenton . a library , filled with the world 's great books , music lessons , watercolor exercises -- 
all right , how 's the new partner ? 
it will be all right . i 'll take care of you . 
oh ! i 'm sorry ... 
sounds fair enough . 
and these ? 
i 'm incapable of such an act , and so are you . 
geller , you do n't want a reporter 's life . they 're very -- messy . you 're all about order . control . and getting me my copy by <number> . 
who said there was a girl for you ? i was talking about a girl for me . do n't you want your aphid beer ? 
everything 's spring-loaded , even if the power 's out it 's fully functional . 
but i 'd arranged to go home with you myself . 
smell ? uh , something like methylcyanoacrylate . 
and her fiancé ! how nice . i hope you 'll be very happy -- or is that what <number> says to the woman ? 
where 's she at ? 
i 'm going to find your sister . 
we 're not going to sleep out here , are we ? 
she 's . . . 
mmm . like kissing a rose . well , au revoir . 
got a lawn this afternoon , but i 'm free until then . 
you lied to me ? 
yes . exactly . nothing more complicated than perception . you explore the universe . we 've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself ... full of powerful forces ... most people are n't aware enough of the now ... to ever notice them ... 
<person> galindo . he hit .314 at lynchburg last year . 
limestone quarry , southern mansion . <person> to get them mixed up ... i say we invite ourselves to the party . 
the thing with <person> -- it 's like the sun shines on you and it 's glorious , then he forgets you and it 's very very cold . 
which part of that fantasy turns you on most : me with other men -- or just the other men ? 
you have to have an employment certificate to work for <number> of the german firms in the ghetto , otherwise ... 
make it yourself , or is it real ? 
... would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment ? 
<person> ? 
why , you going to make me a better offer ? 
lay off once , would you ? 
you happy ? 
a direct <number> . 
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us ! 
you are mad ! 
it 's okay . <person> <person> , i finished all the books for summer reading . 
aw , c'mon . 
<person> , i believe in you . more to the point , i read your new script ... um ... 
oh for chrissakes , everything smells like that in mexico . 
no , it is n't . your name is norman . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the <number> you could n't save . what was his name ? `` <person> , we 're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . '' `` but i do n't want to go swimming , norman . i 'm scared . '' `` c'mon , < u > <person> < /u > , it 'll be fine , it 'll be fun . '' you heartless fuck . that 's why you 're so scared of the water , is n't it ? 
do n't look like nothing . 
is it working yet ? 
but , sir ... i ... i ... 
do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off ? 
yeah ? 
but , he said he 'd try . 
why not ? these are not rebels , look at them . soon they will be worthless to you . why not take some money , for your work ? 
who 's that ? 
you ca n't hurt me more than i 'm hurt already . 
why ? you 're never going to know . * 
the moon ? 
do n't be scared . this time i 'm right behind you if you fall . 
client notes . <person> . what can i do for you ? 
the phone made me do it ! 
how is <person> ? i did n't know he was out of stir . 
what 's that , <person> ? 
surely you are familiar with this practice , <person> <person> . only when our lips are silent , can our prayers truly be heard . 
<person> . you look great . i 'm totally exhausted . 
a lot sharper , <person> ! i 'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers ! 
well , do n't worry about it . 
so . 
he 'll barely be able to sit up . 
<number> . 
if it is n't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor . 
and a special thank you to geoffrey and <person> , without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels . they toast the cliftons . 
you know where it came from . it 's not like it 's anybody 's life savings . it would n't even be missed . 
you saw him sitting out there in front , did n't you ? 
i ... 
were there ever any suspects ? 
ouch . do you think we could spend some time together this morning ? 
why did you stop ? 
... what 's the matter ? 
what the hell is that thing doing out there ? you 're not taking that body anywhere . 
first <person> -- now this . 

but y'see , chum , the problem i got is that <number> country just wo n't play ball with me . you know how that can just bug a guy , do n't you ? 
not yet . <person> , norman , i want ... 
... ... she forgot her purse at my work and i wanted to get it back to her . 
maybe she used another name . 
... it was a toss-up . his company went to india , mine went to france . flip of a coin . 
yes . 
shit ! he sent them all . 
right . 
there are still things i have to do . 
nothing . 
are you sure ? 
christ , <person> . how did you know ? 
my point is , that 's probably what you 're gon na end up with . 
if you stepped on a mine you 'd be dead by now . nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore . 
hello , <person> . 
how was your tour ? 
horrible ... 
`` i know not . '' 
everyone needs plastic surgery . you need it . 
yeah , you met her ? 
you 're up late . 
do n't worry , it wo n't damage it , it 'll just give it a little incentive . 
but why did you want to ? 
i told her i would speak to you , that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding . she has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble , so why should n't she stay . as <number> italian to another , i ask you the favor . 
do you believe in him , <person> ? 
nah -- he 's taken care of . 
she understands what you 're going through and she really wants to help you . she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it . 
ah , <person> 
... stan , i 'm thinkin ' we should offer 'em half a <number> . 
what ? 
but with these down , does n't that pose a major security concern if , as you say , you have to keep an eye on everything at all times ? 
i told you not to bring the other <number> . 
so have i 
i hereby declare this the <person> <person> <person> for passionate experimentation . in the future , anyone wishing entry must have permission from me . 
maybe you should n't drink so much . 
would that make you any happier ? 
well , <number> or <number> minutes ! maybe <number> ! 
i said i just wanted to talk to you ... 
how did this happen ? 
<person> has been apprised of our situation , captain . 
what 's the plan ? 
i deny your <person> 's accusations , and beg you to say how you have been cheated ? 
were the <number> of you ... involved ? 
i 'll come back later , huh ? 
... he 's a sorry old guy , but i like him . 
what did he play ? 
he is n't going to hurt enough as it is . *she* has to twist a knife in him , too -- the regal jackass ! `` i 'll turn my glamour on him , '' she says -- 
you heard me ! you make me sick when you pretend to not understand what i am saying to you ! go away from here ! 
yeah , but do n't pick me up . my father may think it 's strange . i 'll walk over to your house . i 'll be there at <number> o'clock . 
holy smoke ! a half a heelot ! 
the lock ... 
something we did changed the case ... changed history . <person> was n't dead . but then after you did n't die in the fire something must have happened . and this guy , this nightingale guy , he kept on killing ... it was like a spree ... <number> more women . 
is this a fair mix ? 
stop it , doyle ! 
yeah ? what <number> words , <person> ? 
yeah right . 
this is dr. <person> 's answering service . 
time to activate <person> <person> . 
the worst ? 
i did n't realize . yeah , you do look a little pale . how soon will you be ready ? a week ? 
i prefer not to push the engines until they 've been properly run in . 
did you tell that to <person> when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you ? 
you 're <person> ? oh ... well , look , they took your stuff out . moved it to some hotel , i think . 
whoa , whoa -- i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
<person> up and play darling . your turn . 
i want you to ride with me . <person> ' does n't sound right . 
no , <person> . you made a deal . you ca n't just renege on a deal . that 's lying . 
officer , i can explain . 
course you did n't . 
are you okay ? 
i ca n't take her with me . 
that 's the one . <person> <person> . 
-- where ? - 
that 's because i am the shark . 
i 'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers ! 
my keys . 
that 's because we do n't belong anywhere . you do n't fit into your world , and i do n't fit into mine . we 're the outcasts of the universe . 
dead . 
pardon me ? 
what took you so long ? 
are you out of your mind ? 
it that mother real ? 
good . <person> horrorshow . <person> comes to them as waits . i 've taught you much , my little droogies . now tell me what you have in mind , <person> <person> . 
it is whispered in the forest that ... ... <person> 's castle is under siege by <person> and uryens . 
if you were n't going to let me get away with it , why did you let me go thru with it ? 
do n't even tell me you 're hot for <person> <person> <person> <person> over there . 
what is it ? 
let 's hit it . 
why does he have a lock on his door ? 
ready ? 
see anything ? 
and it 's < u > my < /u > call . i promised them water-skiing , instead o ... 
bedrock ! i can not dig any further in zis direction ! 
what 's that on your forehead , pal ? 
uh , yeah ? <person> ? it 's me . 
what happened ? 
almost everything 's been done -- under panic . but this is a thousand to <number> shot . that man 's still sitting around his apartment ; he is n't panicked . 
material made from self-regulating unstable molecules . i 've been working on a formula for this . 
better than good , he is a fucking liability . 
aw-right . what about the other guy ? 
no . 
-- his left jacket pocket . 
<person> <person> ? impossible . 
you said it a <number> times ! 
oh nothing . 
i ca n't say . 
why , what 'd you hear ? 
why ? who said ? 
not bad -- for a cowboy -- you 're okay , you 're okay . 
`` <person> , row , row your boat ... '' i love `` row ... '' do - do you know `` <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> your boat ? '' 
am i mentoring the wrong mentee ? 
i have to run . but what i hope to see , they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money . it becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it , but in the end they ca n't . can they ? 
what you doing , <person> ? 
i will . take it easy . 
that 's not correct . 
why ? 
i do n't suppose you 've seen her . 
can you fill me in here ? 
i 'll come . 
but i ate your mom 's pie . 
you 're here because your government is putting pressure on my government . this is an internal affair , a czech affair , that you are interfering with . i will warn you once : do n't shit in my lawn . get whatever information your government seeks and get our . 
actually , i think that i ... 
that so . 
sal , i want my money . 
no questions . 
i 've got patients coming in -- 
eduardo . <person> . 
to do what ? 
she is going to be well ? 
nine bodies . 
you 're not doing the extra credit problems . 
following me to find <person> ? 
how 'd you get that ? playing with your pitchfork ? 
huh ? 
that 's like ... those people stitching <person> in panama saying they 're in the nba . 
what 's that guy 's name ? sue ? 
damn it , edmunds ? 
calvin ? ! 
by the x . 
ernest , what do you think ? 
six bodies , <person> ! that 's what i have seen between here and <person> . a filling station in flames . i 'm telling you <person> <person> is here in this town . he 's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way . 
i would n't imagine where . 
you were a soldier , and then a gladiator , were n't you ? 
-- you sonofabitch , goddamn it , i did n't drop -- 
straight up . 
no . it 's useless , <person> . it would n't work , not ever ... 
silly , there 's nothing in there to be afraid of . 
yeah , but my- 
we need an exit . 
she starts givin ' me some bullshit about it ai n't there . it 's somewhere else and we can go get it . i 'm shootin ' you in the head right then and there . then i 'm gon na shoot her in the kneecap , find out where my godamn money is . i go walkin ' in there and that nigga <person> or anybody else is in there , you 're the first man shot , understand what i 'm sayin ' ? 
those rockefellers ! 
i think we 're here and we do n't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home . 
o'neil ? 
it does n't travel through the air , by breathing , or touching , right ? 
hi , everyone . i don t think we 've met . i 'm <person> <person> although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam . 
possession of a stolen shovel . 
what would you do up here ? 
the same thing -- his business pressures , the whole move and everything . he 's frantic about nailing this new job , worried about screwing over his present boss . 
oh c'mon , i love 'em , but you know they only had me 'cause <person> needed a kidney . 
possibly . just to spite dehaven . 
<person> gillis , if you please . 
he ca n't , <person> . he 's been suspended from after-school activities . <person> ... are you still with us ? how was your therapy session tonight ?

god damnit , <person> . this is not a game . this is business . 
oh , well ... those are ... i mean , we do n't get to keep our work . i could maybe ask them if you could choose <number> . but , you know , frankly <person> , you were the best . computer models ca n't begin to match the beauty you gave yours . they 're a part of this firm . they inspire me . i go out there and sometimes just stare at something i 've designed . it amazes me . i would miss that too much . look , i may be going out on a limb , but you go out there and look them over , every single <number> of them and pick the <number> you like the best and take it with you . just run it by me first , just in case , you know ... but i 'm sure it 'll be okay .

it is n't him . <person> , you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this . 
now , <person> , you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player ? 
you lied to me . 
i ... i do n't know . i guess ... when people think you 're dying , they really listen , instead ...

your uncle 's a good man ... i wo n't stick him . either he gets the money or the place and right now he 's getting the place . and tell me why should i care ? i got a partner who 's a bum , who does n't help out ... who disappears and leaves me with all the problems . i should go back to florida ... i do n't need this . 
what makes you so sure ? 
i 'm afraid not . he looked right at your picture without batting an eye . but it 's probably temporary . he got all the way to <person> , so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head . i 'm sure it 'll all come back to him . it just takes a catalyst . 
well , some of the children just do n't respond to <number> step programs .

<person> . yeah . he was my mentor . he had a major influence on the new left in the late '60s ... and on me , personally . 
you never had it . 
what 's that , chief ? say again .

yes , you are , when i was straightening up the couch , you know what i found ? six hairpins , a lipstick , a pair of false eyelashes , and a swizzle stick from the stork club . 
and this would be my study . there was an elm tree outside the window then .

wadda you think ? 
no you do n't . did you see the woman in the red dress ?

this is a very auspicious occasion . 
<person> was questioned in <number> dozen murders , but they always had to let him go . there were never any witnesses .

where did you learn how to drive like this ? 
schofield ? you from schofield ?

be nice to rose . she 's never had a real home . 
how crazy is that . 
i operate out of the chicago o'hare hub . can i help you with anything else ? 
oh , hello , perhaps you could help me . i 'm looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request .

you sure ? 
but you will not ... be safe ... 
i know that . 
you ... you selfish , selfish child . at least talk to him , hear what he has to say .

he ca n't even move . 
well ? 
i think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet . 
but could i just tell you this <number> thing ? 
she needs to be changed again . <person> crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as <person> changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re- lieved yet still anxious , <person> paces to a mirror . willow rocks the baby gently , absently looking at the fire . then his eyes focus on the fire . 
of course not . they 're possibles . i 've checked them against bureau records , check them against your file . how did you get it ? 
i 'm engaged to <person> just the same as <person> <person> was to <person> <person> . but <person> 's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy i 've never dreamt of before . <person> , burning kisses .

i do n't find this very funny , 
irena . 
i got ta figure some way out of this thing ! 
yeah , but , what if this guy lived a <number> , <number> years ago ? like , what if he was a cave man , and now he 's dead ? 
you have n't started in on the internal organs ? 
and how do you feel about that ? 
on account of mitch ? 
it is n't necessary . 
see . it 's <number> in the morning . a walk sounds a little screwy to me , if you do n't mind . 
it was wild . she was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things . i tried to satisfy her the best i could , but it was difficult in my condition . 
he 's in a meeting . he ca n't be disturbed . 
me neither . 
you know how to waltz ? ?

<person> studied several styles , but his favorite was <person> <person> <person> . 
out ridin ' . so ... how you doin ' ? 
this might just be me , but that is hands down , the dumbest fucking idea i 've ever heard . 
you buying ? he kinda wanders around . you 'll see him if you pay attention . 
he blames you for everything that 's wrong about me . thinks you raised me stupidly . 
<person> laurent ? 
: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game -- 
i told you she was innocent . 
stay away ! 
how do you shave in there ? 
who was the girl you walked off with ? 
have we met before ? 
<number> of them , anyway ... did you see it ? the screamer ? 
that who ? 
mary is <person> 's sister ? 
<number> at a time ? 
you do n't know what you want -- 
the sheriff has just received <number> more letters threatening his life , but he says nothing can interfere with his duty .

your eames table is incredible . and the b & b . i just put that in a client 's home , actually , but in red .

well , you 're catching on . 
have a heart gentlemen . their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion . 
... he used to say , `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . '' 
so why did you come back here , <person> ? 
mexico ! and guess what i 'm going to do there ? ! 
no , i do n't . though i have to say i 'm curious . 
comrades ! comrades ! do n't let 's give in so quickly . after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia . 
i know that , <person> . 
look , yesterday was n't my idea . that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings . 
i do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death , but i hold no prisoners-of-war . 
no , to be honest , i find it dull . 
yeah ! that 's thinking . 
and i know people . 
not the way i did it . i was loaded half the time . i do n't know how you could change bedpans sober . i used to hang out with this guy , <person> . he was an x-ray technician or something . 
updating the condition of all bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector , sir .

of course , i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here . you do n't mind ? 
i do n't know , <number> or <number> . 
there 's this poem by <person> , i do n't remember the whole thing , but it 's about that . about waiting for that person , and wondering if you 'll ever find them . and the last line of it goes , `` who knows ? perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us , yesterday -- 
hey ... hey ! slow up . you do n't have to go so fast . 
why do n't you give 'em a call . 
what are you doing ? 
sulu ! 
no . <person> 's team must finish planting the detonators ... and theo needs time on the vault . after the * police come they 'll waste hours trying to negotiate ... that 's when we search * for this man . until then ... we do not alter the plan . 
<person> <person> has been dead for some time senator . 
should n't be , <person> 
i live here , remember ? 
for what ... to set me up ? she loved me she would n't frame me . 
<person> closed , okay ? thirty seconds . 
and thank you for getting me up here . i 've never seen this before . <person> , is n't it ? 
you know what i think ? i think you only want me now , because i 'm with somebody else . 
no , lil . it 's just you ca n't understand their brand of patriotism . 
because of <person> ? are the same people gon na kill us , <person> ? 
just for fun ? 
bloody . 
you 've been coming out here every summer for the last <number> years , young lady , and you still have n't learned how . 
because i guarantee she 's married and has a couple kids . girls like mary do n't stay single . 
i know it was n't me ... so that leaves you . 
how much more do they need than your death at his hands ? 
not on my own beat , no . 
ah ... no one ... i give it to copper when he needs it ... 
is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone ? 
because he 's an inconsiderate asshole . 
it is only too possible . <person> requires a mutual harmony which is difficult , and it is even more difficult to make it last . 
oh , <person> thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the cowboy . should i wear my ten gallon hat and my <number> shooters ? 
i 'll take a ride . 
i 'm fuckin ' hungry now , you know . 
i 'll bet you do , <person> <person> . i 'll just bet you do . 
what are you going to do ? 
i put blueberries in them just the way you like . 
i should be eating with the crew . 
you told them cowboys you had it . 
what are you sorry for ? 
you said the `` s '' word . 
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me . 
of course . where else ? 
where 'd you get them antlers ? 
nope . 
oh give it up , <person> . i 'm just making conversation . 
got a thick feelin ' here . 
cause she does n't look at me like everybody and i do n't want her to . i do n't want her to know . 
yes . 
i ca n't breathe ! ... i 've got to get out ! 
you were a beat and a quarter behind . 
she 's not the first foster that you 've had . < u > is < /u > she ? 
still in love ? 
no , madame , it 's the way you < u > follow < /u > . 
yes . 
<person> to disappoint . 
what do you mean ? 
you 'll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion , but there are subtle differences between us . mcdermott is the biggest asshole . <person> <person> is the yes man . price is the most wired . i 'm the best looking . we all have light tans . right now i 'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table , and <person> <person> keeps asking dumb , obvious questions about how to dress . 
why ? 
i offered my help this morning and <person> turned me down . 
what the hell is that for ? 
no goodbye . no fuck you . no 'are you in love with <person> ? ' 
if the applicant is young , we tell him he 's too young . <person> , too old . <person> , too fat . 
do n't you remember ? he has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up - 
i want to know if my sister is here . 
god , i ca n't believe i ever hated you . 
he 's not the murderer . but he 's a bozo . 
neil , you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately . 
thank you , i can see that . try something else . 
about his letters -- that 's all she remembered . <person> violent material , i 'd say , obsessive , a quite sick man . but that 's not unusual either . 
relax now , <person> -- 
it 's very small . 
not a prayer . 
is that what i did , now ? and of course , you can prove all of it . 
nothing , i guess… 
you talk to <person> ? 
great . i 'll pick you up around <number> o'clock . is that good ? 
i did n't kill the watchman . 
you 've killed your fair share of men . 
... you 're young , <person> ... you still have a chance to get out . you ca n't give up this chance . you have to protect it . there 's a lot of things to do in life , a lot of other jobs ... 
oh no , i 'm not . i do n't like your face . besides , there 's something fishy about a person who would settle for a <number> dollars when they can get <number> <number> . i 'm surprised that <person> <person> , who 's supposed to be a smart man , could n't see through that . 
thank god . now listen to me , asshole . i 'm giving you a break . but if my partner finds out you 're here , you 're gon na be reading rat tracks in sioux falls <person> <person> . 
i do n't know how you put up with him . 
let me be the judge of that , <person> . 
maybe i should follow you around and ask <number> of your tricks what it 's like to sleep with you . 
yes siree -- that 's the idea . get them all here and then say : `` look , folks -- here 's <person> <person> , my guest of honor . '' <person> , i can see their eyes pop already . 
i have to see <person> <person> . 
can i go get those mangos now ? 
you were lucky today , vice boy . <person> said to leave it alone , but just remember , i 'm watching you . 
are you crazy ? 
so . i wo n't be seeing her ? your clients usually visit me after the settlement . 
once we have the money , then none of this ever happened . 
their money is no good to them . soon all the ineysi will be dead . 
i 'm so glad you like each other . i was so scared , so scared . 
what 's a buzzer ? 
i 'm tired . i need to rest . 
i 'm late . got ta protect and serve the world , y'know . 
what ? ? 
how long have we been driving ? 
schoolboy tings is you head . <person> for you , badness for her , badness for me , lyin ' here tumor , big as breadfruit , poison my inners an ' waiting . 
<person> <person> ... ? 
tell me about it . 
my ass is falling . it is . 
but the boys told us they did n't get any . 
how 's dee ? 
nothing . 
i was waiting for that jack . 
i can handle it . he 's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway . 
if you do n't mind dancing with an old fogey like me . 
this is so embarrassing ... 
why you talking to me ? 
a ) it 's always the person you do n't suspect ; b ) that means you think it 's <person> because you really suspect gideon ; therefore c ) if you think it 's <person> , it has to be someone else -- <person> . 
did n't <person> have any friends ? 
how come you took your own car ? 
you 'd better stay here . i 'll find a way out . we 'll come back for you . 
the final route for the railroad is complete . 
it 's an experimental model . he does n't dare leave it in his car , for fear it will fall into the hands of competition . 
i 'm asking you seriously , <person> , a stranger ? 
well , <person> <person> 's pretty grisly . 
well , it ai n't no pup tent in the garage , you know what i mean ? fuck . so they 'll talk and talk . they 'll probably talk all night . and , oh , they 'll decide that they 're gon na spend the night together , right ? but , you know , they 're gon na keep their underwear on and they 're not gon na do anything . by <number> a.m. he 's parking the pink cadillac . <person> . there 's really only <number> answer . 
hey , i really enjoyed your set . 
protein digestion is very costly in water usage . 
are you out of your mind ... ? 
where were you going ? 
excuse me ! you went to a party with her ? 
no idea . 
she 's not gon na die . 
i do n't think so . 
comin ' to think of it , forty winks would n't be bad . 
you should have stayed in bed this morning . 
we had us a deal here for nineteen- <number> . you sat there and darned if you did n't tell me you 'd get this car , these options , without the sealant , for nineteen-five ! 
it 's about time we spoke to each other , is n't it ? 
well ... what do you think about then ? i mean ... well what do you think about ? 
i 'm into garbage . it 's my thing . 
no , your grace ! i mean with all humility , no . i would rather you dismissed me . it 's obvious i do n't satisfy . 
bandit ? 
do what ? 
better go on back and get some more sleep . you 'll need it later on . 
no more revolts . 
yeah . 
you got it . could you maybe not tell anyone about this ? 

you 're not ? 
a scar . on the arm . of the man who planted this in <person> <person> 's car . 
think of this business like a big aquarium . you got ta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top . 
but i ca n't be sure . i do n't even know who he is . he 's too insulated . too many layers around him . 
no way . 
spends his nights at the kuala lumpur yacht club . 
<person> joey , how ` bout a cocoa , double whip cream . 
and where 's <person> ? 
you mean -- 
all my things have me in them . i do n't want you to be like me . 
mom ... 
yes . please . i want you to . 
me ? 
it 's <number> way . 
whenever <person> tells someone how steadfast i am , he always makes me sound boring . 
leave . take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money . 
so , <person> . first off , how far along are you ? 
did n't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor ? 
yes i feel it in my bones . 
of course . 
right . 
paid sick leave ? 
oh . 
hello , ma . 
naw , man . i just told you , i 'm comfortable . i ai n't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable . you bring your ass out here . 
what ? 
i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you . 
what did i tell you ? listen . 
did you go see my cousin maynard like i asked you in my letter ? 
captain , how will you be able to follow my charts -- -- from up there ? 
thank you . will you bury <person> ? i know he 's dead . 
no , i 'm not coming in . and if you 'd rather go to a `` singing lesson '' than have dinner with your father ... 
who was that other guy ? 
where in mexico would you like -- 
it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples . 
yes . your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting . 
then it 's fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me . in the meantime , <person> <person> , i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates . 
so , you say you 've been to italy before ? 
mobile infantery rules ! 
we never reveal our sources , which is why you can talk to us . 
i 've tried that ! population census have got him down as dormanted , the central collective storehouse computer has got him down as deleted , and the information retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... security has him down as excised. , <person> have him down as completed 
that 's the front up the road a few miles . we have to get by without some of the comforts of home . 
you 've done it yourself , only you did it on a very small scale . 
well , that 's okay , i just - 
oh , surely <number> can have a tiny touch . 
i 'm sorry , er ... the biggest one . 
you know who i am ? <person> <person> <person> . my friends call me tnt . you know why ? 
catherine ... 
i tried to pay you off . 
i do n't know where . in your store , somewhere in your town ... anywhere . 
okay . <person> . 
you were singing , were n't you ? a beautiful voice , <person> <person> <person> . 
that ... is highly unlikely . you 're talking about an act of god . 
oh , i hope we got them in time . 
properly arranged , yes . 
if it 's in italian , how will i know what they 're saying ? 
i told you not to buy that hunk of junk ! 
what the hell are you doing ? 
`` there is a justice higher than that of man . i will be judged by <person> . '' 
he 's already dead . 
excuse me , i 'm having a goddamn party , is that allright with you ? 
i do n't think i like this . 
are you calling me a liar ? i 'm telling you i 'm broke . i do n't even have insurance on my goddamned car . 
it looks open on the other side . 
is he all right , papa ? 
i 'm not kidding . 
up down . down up . it 's the same . you see things through both eyes . 
okay , then we 'll see you there . 
take your boots off . you 're tan . 
<number> people do . <person> <person> and me . 
because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed . 
ca n't you tell me anything ? 
i am a servant of the his majesty the emperor . i have served his majesty on <person> long enough for my eyes to change . 
he was gentlemanly . i like that . 
all presences have a home space . a place where they live , so to speak . where do they hide out ? 
yeah . 
is there a problem up the road , <person> ? 
monday ? 
i played piano in a few places . 
kiss me . 
here 's my proposition , <person> <person> . 
iraqis . 
what , <person> <person> ? are you yet breathing ? 
nah , accommodation address . 
they spurred onto high ground , <person> <person> , full of spirit and looking for the zulu . full of sport they were , <person> <person> . 
something that brings warmth to my heart . <person> platypus . 
it 's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people 's lives . 
i 'm flattered you think so . 
good call . 
what time is it ? 
generally known ! what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots ? 
no . i - i 'm just curious , you know . i was wonderin ' how much he would put into a thing like that . that 's all . 
<person> desmond , it 's ... 
you do ? 
get - get up ! get up ! 
are you <person> <person> ? 
okay , give us the women . 
mother ! 
to what ? trap him ? 
really ? 
i know . <person> i threw a scare into our lives there -- 
why ? 
let 's walk through the park ... 
yes ? what is it ? 
went away ? 
you got to be more careful . i remember <number> time -- 
really ? 
it 's got nothing to do with justice . it 's national security . 
do you know why he 's called <person> <person> ? tell me . the newspapers wo n't say . 
p-a-r-a-s-o ... 
nervous ? 
that 's what is know as `` manless melancholia . '' 
i said , it 's coming . just get me in , man . 
i do n't blame him . 
we had a court-martial in your absence . they wanted to put a bullet in your head . i pleaded for clemency . said we should find out what happened first . so what did happen ? 
forget me , forget what i did for you . do n't < u > ever < /u > mention my name or try to contact me again . get it ? 
would n't you feel more natural taking a bow ? 
i have no time to argue , gillian . or even tell you how much you 've meant to us ... the < u > frequency < /u > . 
how long were you up there ? 
i do n't know . but i 'm in trouble . i 'm all over the papers . i have to figure out what 's going on . 
not at all . 
what 's their program ? 
i 'll go in with a team . but first i 'm going to need some intel . i 'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they wo n't see coming . <number> of their own . 
yes , well ... 
i uh ... do n't think we 're quite at your pitch yet . 
them straw polls is ugly . 
this room sucks . 
here ’ s the thing . i really hadn ’ t planned on giving you your ... uh ... anniversary gift until tonight . you know , anniversary ’ s good all day ... 
i just needed a wash and set , a wash and set , that 's all . 
i just got here . 
where have you been ? 
since when ? 
it was just words . 
they 're factory alarms ... easy to get around ... for a man with ... skills ... 
where 'd you learn that ? 
you got it ? <number> year scholarship to a top college , plus medical school or <person> <person> or whatever <person> wants ; pay off the $ <number> to my attorney , plus pay her fee in full , plus my annual consulting fee ... 
there is a 20th century possibility . 
she 's doing the work herself . 
i called the asshole at <number> in the morning and he was n't even home . i do n't know what he 's got to be mad about . i 'm the one who should be mad . 
do n't call me dear boy . 
only in the emergency room or when he was well . 
because i trust you , <person> . by the way , the name 's fletcher . i.m . fletcher . i write a newspaper column under the name <person> <person> . 
i 'll look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves . 
wait ! first i give you special fuck ! 
what the hell are you talking about , kid ? 
bastia -- and you ? 
good morning to you , too . you look good . 
it was <person> . that girl who tried to follow me on the field trip . 
remember ? we were in the dayroom , watching tv , and you were all upset about the ... desecration of the planet . and you said to me , `` would n't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are ? '' you do remember that , do n't you ? 
i 'm not worth risking your life for . 
best we got . 
are you all right ? 
leave me alone -- ! 
it makes sense . i mean , do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up ? 
the point was to love each other . 
why did n't you tell me about this ? 
the doctor . 
you 're a real tough guy when the ladies are around , are n't you , <person> ? 
like what ? 
anita ! 
<person> christ .

i told him where i was from a few days ago . it was just a casual conversation . 
shit ! 
who is he ? 
but more or less . 
majesty , this is <person> <person> . she is my landlady . 
yes -- i do understand . 
take it easy , <person> . 
you found your way to us and we were n't easy to reach , were we ? 
hold this thing up for a week . <number> weeks if you have to ... 
keep reading ... 
you should n't be fighting with that jerk . 
what makes you say that ? 
you 'll get to meet them all tomorrow . they 're ... survivors . in a way . all severely sleep disordered . insomnia , narcolepsy , bedwetting ... 
would you like to see that ?

lloyd ? 
worf to <person> ... 
i guess . except i 'm <number> of the people it frightens .

so , what are you doing tonight ? 
i thought maybe you 'd like to be here when she wakes up . 
what 's up ? 
we can do it ... 
that conviction does n't convince me of anything . until i know that i did it , i 'm not going to accept that i did . 
i sure am glad you said you 'd come out with me tonight mary sue . 
something maybe grew a size bigger . 
hi . 
you got common sense . she ai n't . when you grow up that money 'll be yours . now swear . `` i will guard <person> with my life ... '' 
you 're really terrific , you know what i mean -- linnea rolls over and faces him . 
when you are ripe for my pleasure , i will enjoy the harvest . 
great story goober , how much ? 
that 's right -- premature ejection . 
added to which indignity , i got <number> months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner . some quarterback punk , <person> <person> or something . 
really ? 
ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .

you might be right , but <person> is overrated . i need something real .

under him ? 
<person> , you ca n't do that . these guys 're like me , they 're pacificists . <person> was a conscientious objector . 
people like <person> who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money . 
even more reason to see him . he 'll be overjoyed with your success . 
i guess we open it . 
where are you going ? 
you ca n't just pull the plug , <person> . 
well , i do n't know if that 's ethical . you see , all statements are supposed to come from me . 
all products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value . 
can you read ? 
where is it ? 
too many men have died at its edge . it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade . 
and herbert exchange a glance . honora smiles at juliet . 
christ , you scared the shit out of me . 
what is she saying ? 
an inquiry into what ? 
well , <person> , this does present a liability issue for the hospital . 
your father was <number> then . just like you ... . 
i 'll show you how to chew it . '' your pal closes , all that comes out of your mouth is bile , how fucked up you are ... 
they 're getting awfully close ... what the hell are they doing ? 
uh-huh .

if it 's not too much trouble , i thought i might . 
i thought you were just shy , but now i think it 's something else . 
i 'll take <person> up to bed . 
well , you did n't appreciate the severity of it until recently . no question about that . 
i am willing to apologize ... i 'm willing to do anything to prevent this war . 
it says <person> <person> is hiding at yu 's . on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yu 's . were you involved ?

what guy ? 
are you ready for me ? 
in my town , when you 're looking for someone , you ask me . 
well , can you tell me why ? 
are we safe ? 
that 's because it 's disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up <number> days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . great gag . 
no ... no ... this is embarrassing . i was returning your pillowcase ... and i saw you cross the street ... and i sort of started following you . i just find you really intriguing . i do n't know why . 
she must be about thirty-three , thirty- <number> . 
i 'm sure , i said .

totally understood . totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you 've had . totally sorry . 
well , for the past couple of years i 've been goin ' out with girls from my acting class . 
i told that woman i 'm an orphan . 
i 'm not doing it .

if i do n't meet up with them , you can come and pick me up by nightfall . 
most new yorkers never notice it - most americans have never heard of it . 
so ... 
i say none of us leave this room until our young mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants . now <person> , i know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us . 
it wo n't open . 
i just do n't think it 's right , keepin ' him under wraps like we 's ashamed of him .

... you 're absolutely right . 
this is the perfect time to panic ! i 'm lost , <person> is gone , they 're going to move from their house in <number> days and it 's all your fault ! !

why not ? 
yeah .

you have no idea what 's happened to me . 
it 's not much , but it should get you to switzerland .

i was saying ... it might even be possible that <person> had left with them . 
sir , if we fire a tachyon burst , it may force him to reset his shield harmonics . when he does , we could beam him out ... 
<person> marge . 
sure . 
is it true that you gave <person> <number> of lydia 's dresses ? that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ? 
when did you hear ? 
how much money do you have ? 
i 'm sorry , general . the cellar is empty . 
those stamps -- they 're worth a fortune ! 
that 's it ? hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it . she made us call her a different name . she 'd say , `` you 're talking to <person> now '' and we 'd leave the house for a few days . 
i do n't know . 'cause you 're cute . 
oh yeah ? wan na arm wrestle ... ? 
your mother was blind ? 
you 're damn right i do . 
uh-huh . 
i got big ideas , though ! 
listen , bren-duhhh , i think you 're the <number> overstepping boundaries . you 're acting like you 're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else . besides , who cares if he 's married ? i can have friends who are married . 
why not ? 
no , <person> -- they are not race horses . they are good old friends of mine . i call 'em constitution and <person> of rights , the most dependable pair for long journeys . i 've got <number> called <person> <person> , too , and then there 's a supreme court -- fine , dignified horse , though you do have to push him now and then . 
did i what ? 
hmmm . maybe i 'll ask when i see you in person . 
oh , yeah , you 're just so smart . 
but why ? 
this morning , a lieutenant and <number> soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons . i explained we had only my late father 's sword , which , in fact , was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory . 
how 's it going ? 
sir , that 's a field job . it 's outside the scope of my assignment . and i 've got a test tomorrow on - 
he was a ... good lover ? 
what do you believe in ? 
yeah . 
you mean ... ? 
and still the connection was undeniable . i have n't read `` eternity forever '' but i know it 's brilliant . and i know i would be perfect for <person> . 
i can see the benefit in that . 
now , <person> , you know it was all a mistake , do n't you ? 
i told him i did n't know nothin ' . but <person> and , uh , <person> <person> said if you did anything , you 're fucked up . 
did you settle things with <person> <person> ? 
i thought i 'd wait for you . 
you flatter me , <person> . 
that they are . 
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you . 
no , no , no ... i love my husband . 
dixie , you know how a rom construct works ? 
what could you find in this place ? 
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is <person> 's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish . be my most tasty little dish ! be my most tasty little dish ! 
i was just being agreeable , now i 've got to explain why ? 
she hates me , <person> . 
she 's ... sick . actually she never had <person> <person> before . 
so where 's the money ? 
-- do n't you want to -- 
jack ! 
lost . it feels lost . this was hers ? 
if the pigs only knew they were subsidizing the panthers ... 
i am usin ' it , <person> . <person> <person> ' how the hell we got in this tangle . you know they hit <person> 's house , too ? shot up his wife . his wife . who ever heard of that ? men sneakin ' around in the dark , back-shootin ' , scarin ' women ? they 're bugs , <person> . you know all your smart talk about <person> and let live ? ai n't no live and let live with bugs . 
him ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable ... a smear on the drafting board . 
bonita , you should n't be discouraged so easily . 
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine ? 
alright ! 
oh , there are so many slots you wo n't know where to begin . 
what ? 
what time ? 
that 's what you do with every <number> . 
good morning <person> . i hope you have n't been waiting too long . 
you want the title shot ? 
like open an airlock by mistake ? 
... the city council ... 
did you decide on a runway yet ? 
but you 'd have to swear not to tell a soul . i 'm not allowed . 
get the fuck out of here . 
what ? 
what are you doing here in the trailer court , <person> ? 
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude . 
maybe i 'm wrong ... maybe we 're not ready yet . in south africa the numbers were small ... 
really -- 
the landlady -- as far as i could tell , the landlady said he was here right now . 
he 's going with you , <person> . 
<person> <person> , <person> -- 
no , i do n't know . tell me . 
it 's a machine gun . i thought i 'd kill myself . 
i do n't know what to say . 
... without caution ... 
oh ... well . 
get out . get out ! get out ! 
i called a fellow i know in tulsa , the one who plays my chauffeur . there 's a sucker there he says is made for us . and a boroker that just shut down , we can use their office , not change a thing ! now , i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble . that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end . we could start this weekend , get the sucker into position -- 
i know just how you feel , son . but believe me , you 're going about it the wrong way . 
<person> , do you know who reps <person> <person> ? 
maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed ... 
thanks for eating it . i do n't know why i even pretend i can cook . 
i 'll hitch . 
so where is he ? 
thanks for holding on . 
he was in the group with me . i guess he did n't ... 
i told you to leave or die , you refused , and now you may have killed us all . for you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than <number> <number> years . 
switching to sub-vocal . <person> , you copy ? 
oh , this is a dangerous game you 're playing , <person> . 
y'know , the guys in robbery are gon na get kind of upset . we 're stepping on their toes of this one . 
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in <number> months . well , it 's been <number> months , and i was looking forward to seeing my son . 
<person> ? 
that was truly pathetic . 
i did not go to high school . 
you did very well . i apologize for the crude images . next time i 'll have film stock that does n't need lights . 
jeffrey ! come on in . 
<person> ? 
ugh ! 
tool ? tool for what ? we 've been going together almost <number> years ! 
let go of the gun . 
ow , <person> -- <person> said not the head . 
... it 's harcourt . 
it wo n't happen again , <person> . 
... you 've quite a sense of humor , mr . <person> - but all kidding aside , may i ask just what you are doing here ? 
are you all right ? 
where is everyone ? 
is there something wrong , sir ? 
ask a question , you get an answer ! .. 
understood . that will be all . 
loud and clear , kid . what 's up ? 
b58/732 , that 's a. buttle is n't it ? 
it wo n't be him . 
... how 'd you sleep ? 
wrecks . 
vegas ! you think we 'll get there by midnight ? 
not me . i 'm not special . i 'm not exceptional . this is , though . what i 'm doing . 
maybe you 're my friend and maybe you 're not -- but do n't come any nearer . you ca n't trust anybody in this crazy world . <person> , i 'll bet i could shoot you from here . 
is this cause of me ? because of the story ? 
i was napping on the couch . there was a voice and a shot . i woke up . <person> was looking at me . 
there are n't enough arrows . 
<person> <person> had a ring . any idea what happened to it ? 
he needs a haircut . 
my real father was a famous german composer 
that 's from your movie , right ? `` the only monsters are here . '' 
just for making the hand-off ? 
here , in case you think of any ideas . 
all i 'm saying is that amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars , and if they ca n't swim here , they 'll use the beaches at cape cod , or long island . 
you know what ? you can go . 
yes , cora . 
and you 're a fool , <person> -- and no doctor . it 's only the dead ones that you know . 
stuff , sir ? 
that is correct . in a garden , growth has its season . there is spring and summer , but there is also fall and winter . and then spring and summer again ... 
uh ... they said ... they will think about it . 
[ maybe your men stole from you . ] 
do you know how to change a tire ? 
what did the six-toes have to say ? 
seat 's too high . 
so what 's your story ? 
yeah . you met him once . 
yo , you gon na show , <person> ? 
anything i can do about it ? 
yeah , sure ... 
because you cut it from the budget <number> years running . 
what 's this <number> eat ? 
this makes no sense . <person> was supposed to crash her van into a lake . could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested ? 
do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots ? 
you know what the fuck i 'm talkin ' about . you talk to her ? 
mr court , be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates ... 
<person> ... my god ...

sense ? if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it . 
you look great . 
you 've only been playing for <number> weeks , <person> . it takes a long time to learn this game . 
i just ... wanted to be put on my own for a while . clear my head . 
hey .

yes , sir . 
sam is <person> . he 's taking up fly fishing . he 's in a yert in montana . 
there were at least <number> , maybe <number> . but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear . there 's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned . and a musician . and some others . 
i know , ma'am ... on'y it 's for a ole lady , no teeth , got ta sof'n it with water so she can chew it , an ' she 's hongry . 
okay ... 
<person> to hear it . 
first off ... <person> did n't carry <number> pistols , though he should of . 
a third stage guild navigator will be here within minutes !

it did n't go anywhere . but that 's not why -- 
shit . 
hold out your hands . 
a model , only as big as this . 
where you wanted to be ? 
it 's my graduation gift from daddy . it cost over a thousand bucks but it 's the best . 
thanks for nothing ! i hate snakes ! 
<person> says exactly what 's on his mind . most people consider what they 're saying ... social skills ... <person> just charges right ahead . now , i know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with <person> & <person> , <person> ... 
so the minister says nice things , and then , what , we all troop outside and they bury him ? 
thank you -- 
i 'll give you these people . 
but you 've just taken care of the spirit all right . 
<number> years . <person> . time flies , do n't it ? <number> years ago we were fartin ' through <person> and pissin ' cristal . now look at us ... 
coulda been a contender . 
<person> hatch , why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me ? 
what happens if they do n't do that ? 
so how many miles do you think it is ? 
he ai n't shootin ' our way no more . he 's shootin ' over that way . who 's he shootin ' at over that way ? 
so was <person> <person> , and our lord loved her . 
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ? 
<person> ' where ? 
<person> ' ? 
excuse me ? 
i got , like , uh ... . 
why was n't i told about `` project mayhem ? '' 
i was tired . i needed a coffee . 
tempestuous ? 
so you do fantasize ? 
hello . 
i have n't been able to get you off my mind . 
yeah , me , too ... 
oh , <person> , you do n't have a drink ? 
it used to be serious -- at least i was -- but he was n't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt . 
that you 're a mistake ? 
who 's under arrest ? you pimple-headed , square-toed spy -- do you realize what you 're doing ? 
`` money . '' so you can get dome money ... 
really ? but , maxine , can of worms ! end of the world ! illusory nature of existence ! 
i 'm just on vacation . 
do n't you think it 's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ? 
please ? i 'm dyin <number> of thirst in here . 
i do n't know where to begin ... 
oh my god . 
wow 
give it back <person> ! 
just a guy i hang out with . 
i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought i 'd be greeting you as a national hero . 
okay , i give up . 
what d'ya got in there ? 
i was doing sports at the station . the newspaper ran this untrue story that i was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail . so they made me anchor . 
you fucked us over . 
what ? 
it 's a great game ! you should play sometime . i bet you 'd be good . you seem very athletic . do you have any hobbies ? 
maybe i should n't take it . 
oh my god ! <person> ! look ! look ! see if that 's him ! 
something 's made you sore . 
just a favor for your old man . 
do you know this man ? is there something between you ? 
the city . i need to get to the ocean . 
ah ... sun tan lotion . any shops nearby ? 
i do n't know , but we ca n't stay here . 
no , man . hey . no , you know what ? hey , it 's you , man . it 's , you know what , you know what it is ? it 's this tarpit of stupidity that we 're all stuck in . it 's this cell . it 's this void , you know . 
crow what ? 
and do n't pass on the right . 
comancheros ... 
dad ! 
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure , if he decided to make peace with the emperor , at least at this time . 
write her . 
do n't you think i stand out like this . 
this time i really do n't see anyone man . 
did you feel that ? 
so , i 'm done . thats it for today ? 
you 'll be at the docks ... keeping <person> abreast of our progress ... 
no , sir . 
daddy guess what i beat <person> <person> in monopoly yesterday . 
so how much for our first tour . <number> no-shows and <number> sick triceratops . 
i do n't recall saying i did n't want a <number> bucks ... 
well , <person> asked me to ask you this , about the wedding . is there any chance you and <person> will get married in amity ? 
you keep it . 
willow , why do n't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here ? 
would you ? it 's all talk , talk , talk . 
i forgot the napkins . 
i 've been thinking about it for awhile , and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me . 
what does the omega <number> do ? 
i told you what happened in rome ! 
nah ... scotch . 
helluva day . 
he was very good . better than some people would think . 
a long time . 
i 'll bet anything he wo n't go to town nor he wo n't ride out on the range . right off he 'll hole up at the ranch . 
yeah ? then gim me another raise . 
i brought it to you in the hospital . 
are you really a virgin ? 
i thought you said she was going with us ? 
so you 're the <number> leading the americans , i shoulda figured . so what 's the scam ? you get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot ? 
what ? 
... that is a very small room . 
are you talking to me ? 
let thy thoughts be guided 
but father , i 'm assistant editor . 
i still do n't get why you 're trying to break into the system . 
that 's great coming from you . 
what about those other guys you live with ? 
<person> beach is the only place for a real hustler . <person> has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world . they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes . 
something 's bothering her . 
since before they stopped us las ' night . 
there 's something wrong with your car , you said . 
all vienna has heard that . 
get rid of the car when you get your apartment , then you 'll still have <number> key . 
i 've known from the very first book that <person> had to be born of nobility and i was right ! 
no ... 
oh my god . how could it happen ? 
-- i 'm not interested in theory . what do we know ? for example , <person> 's disappeared . 
uh ... we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service . 
when a creature dies , the force it generated remains . the force is all around us . it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal . it 's the only way to amplify the power of the force within you . 
... what kinda dog is this again ? 
should n't i go ? 
now . what is it you wanted to tell me ? 
you 're the <number> always turning your nose up at me . 
how 'd you like to win a magic <number> <person> <person> ? 
hey , <person> . is that you ? 
you do n't understand anything . 
the hull 's imploding ! 
they 're questioning <person> about an accident near the airport . some pedestrian ... they think he was run over intentionally . 
this is got ta be a game , right ? 
so i was thinking ... maybe if i met anybody in < u > my < /u > world who was good for < u > you < /u > and if you know somebody in new york good for me , we could fix each other up . 
hey . way to gut it out . 
you 'd cry . cause you miss grandma so much . 
no ! we must do this alone . 
detonation in twenty minutes . 
yes , sweetie , it 's me . 
hurling 's a fast game , is n't it , <person> ? 
so my associate <person> <person> tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture . 
why did n't you call me ? 
your boy . 
why ca n't you be nice to me ? 
how ? when ? 
inspirations a fickle thing , you do n't realise you had it till it 's gone . 
from the grave ? 
<person> mccleery ? 
she 'll tell them everything ... 
and what about your other friends ... you do n't like playing with them ? 
i tried to kill my wife . 
some meeting . with pg & e people . 
which they do . and we 're standing there . all the football guys are in the lobby , watching , there 's even an espn crew . so i turn to her and sort of grandly say , `` well , this is me , <person> , asking you , goddess of <person> <person> , to marry me . '' and i took out the ring , and i do n't much like big scenes , but she said `` yes '' right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies . we 're getting married in february . 
i 'm going to wait here until she comes . 
what ? 
is that your dad ? 
here you go ! no pushing ! 
the worst part - the thing that 's making me crazy - is that <person> is right in front of me . only i ca n't see him ... <person> said , everything i need to catch him is right here , in these pages ... 
caspiar ? i have n't heard of that . 
you plan on driving trucks all your life ? 
the charades .

that 's it ? what are you talking about ? we can still do this ! 
no . you 've arrived on a rather special night . it 's <number> of the master 's affairs . 
uh huh . 
what ? 
we all have to be strong , right ? 
she 's talkin ' about me , <person> . that 's my first name . 
california ? 
you 're wife sucks my cock every night , swallows my cum and loves it . that 's okay . 
no ! what do you want here ? how do you know me ? 
well , <person> . they 've been exceptionally supportive . 
at least i 've stayed true to myself . <person> is more than i can say about some people . 
tish-i'm-tee . 
maybe you should see a shrink . 
i did n't know we had sailboats . 
stop it ! i 'm just trying to say i think we should take our friendship to the next level . 
i wanted some fresh air , <person> . <person> is <person> <person> ? 
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet . 
<person> said ... the raven passed this way hours ago . 
but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you . 
i do n't know . 
then there is n't much i can do , is there ? 
okay . so we need a source . where do we start ? 
sacks of grain , even bread . i own the grain licenses for the military , i can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the danube . 
what about here ?

the official term is `` psychotic '' .

listen , <person> , what if <person> < u > has < /u > got something to hide ? what if he 's the wrong guy , not really the hero ... ? 
then where do we go ? ! 
hector . the big one has no sense of humor . and since < u > he 's < /u > the one who decides whether you get to play , try not to be your obnoxious self . 
so , a little excitement in an otherwise dull day . did is work out okay ? 
are n't the kids asleep ? 
right . 
hal ? well , <person> and i have been friends for a long time . 
this is the studio where i paint . 
diane ! 
suzette -- i told you not to bring the pearls . i will not wear them tonight . 
who is it ? 
can i tell you something ? 
back then -- who was n't ? 
you 're fucked in the head . 
making a male climax is not all that challenging : insert somewhere close and preferably moist ; thrust ; repeat . 
it will . 
you should n't . 
yeah ? 
you ? dine and ditch , right ? over ten bucks ? you 're probably looking at a thumb . 
committed ? 
your father never means to be so ... 
<person> cameron . this is <number> fresh jam , huh ? 
i should release <person> because you want some votes ? 
really . 
but what about the other night ? we were like <number> stars in the same constellation . 
having fun . 
oh , sure . 
i 'm sorry , sir . 
yeah , and my mother was a saint . for fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side . <person> <number> <number> dollars to set her up in business . but hell , what 's that ? you got a problem ? buddy 'll fix it . facing some time in jail ? buddy 'll knock half of it off -- if you do what he says , when he says . you got some business that 's not exactly legal ? talk to buddy -- 
probably . 
how is she ? 
i tried to tell myself i buried him alive . you know -- <person> <person> <person> meets felix the cat . but ... 
it 's okay sweetheart . 
... at all . 
but that was n't <person> 's fault . 
that there <person> <person> is a menace . whenever a patient croaks on him it 's either <person> 's will or somebody else 's fault . 
take it now . 
yes . she 's helped me understand homicidal impulse . 
g-go on , i 'm interested . 
moving violation ! i just got out of bed and you 're telling me you 're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket ? now ? are you nuts ? is that it , whitehouse ? you 're nuts ? 
why ? 
look , <person> , you do n't really kidnap someone that you 're acquainted with . you ca n't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are . 
what do you mean , not the type ? do n't you know who i am ? i 'm big <person> <person> ! i 've been in more porno movies than you ever saw . i 've worked with <person> <person> . i 've worked with <person> <person> . not the type ! i can come ten times a day . i can keep it hard <number> hours at a time . my cock is <number> inches long . 
perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little . 
you must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him . such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular ivy leaguer . turns out he is king <person> . mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins . a girl like you , for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup ? who needs it ! you listen to me , you find yourself a nice , substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what , for whom ? -- for some good time charlie ? sssh ! 
it 's <person> . how are you , <person> ? 
you should n't play this game . 
well , i hope you like these ! <person> sea urchin wrapped in seaweed . or `` nori '' if you prefer . i love sushi . 
we can prove that you 're not <person> <person> . impersonating a fellow cadet is a court-martial in and of itself -- 
he would n't know . < u > i < /u > saw her in the shower ! 
i would n't worry too much about it , <person> . she 'll see it your way . 
keri ... . <person> ... how about if i just call you mom ? 
lotte ! why are n't you at the pet shop ? 
you saw her in the airport and then here ? 
you sure you do n't want to eat something ? 
if you 're heading towards her room , you wo n't find her . 
so that was it . 
oh god ! what have we done ? 
brandt , give him the envelope . 
a mountain goat ? that 's really sweet . 
well , because i never thought of god in my life . now i 'm giving it serious thought . 
i volunteered . 
maybe he does n't play well with others . 
going away does n't mean you leave lasher behind . he was on rowan 's deck - and the plane ... geography seems irrelevant now . 
but , <person> , i only wanted to speak to you -- 
how you feeling ? 
no . it 's <number> of the few times i feel good . i used to have to go to work and cook every day . that i got sick of . 
i do n't know . 
yeah , you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad , huh ? 
ba-ll ! 
if you do n't like them , why wo n't you be more concrete with me ? 
yes , i speak . and read . and think ... and know the ways of man . i 've been waiting for you . <number> months now . 
almost all of them . 
it 's night . 
because god loves a winner . 
what would you say , too fast ... too quick ... 
yeah . 
well , he 's pretty quiet . except for them rackets and breathin ' things he does . ai n't threatened me with a killin ' or anything . but boy you could n't of been more right about him fixin ' things . that son of a bitch is a regular <person> <person> on a lawnmower . loves french fries . eats <number> larges and do n't even so much as belch . i 'm proud to have him . 
everything 's going wrong . i 'm having more trouble with <person> than i ever have before . i ca n't get him to respond . 
i 'm sorry , o'neil . but as class officer , it 's my obligation to report all violations . 
the paper street soap company . 
i do n't understand ? 
well , did you ever think about hiring a business manager ? 
he 's still here . let me buy you a drink . i 'll tell you all about it . <person> , i 'll have him tell you . 
what time was that ? 
you have all this talent , and you waste it . you wo n't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you 've got too much `` integrity '' for that . 
anyway , listen up . they 're gone ! 
popeye . 
tell me about it . i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago , and <number> night we opened for the melvins ... do you know who the melvins are ? 
you cut her . you raped her . you watched ! 
elliot -- our driver . the officer put his gun to the back of elliot 's head and -- fired . it was so quick . 
i 'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for <person> . 
ellie , what is it ? 
never mind the 'sir ' . never mind the 'sir ' . 
no . all you need is to want to be the best . 
another dozen out back . 
you bet you should have called . you still live at home . do n't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning , do n't make me call hospitals . 
why do you think she did it ? 
you mean -- break in ? 
what are we doing here , <person> ? this guy 's a clown . he 's talking about clothes . 
two-fifty . 
yes . 
sid ? 
that 's how i want them . poached . over . 
a man who ca n't control his woman is funny . 
no argument . 
what the hell you doing here ? 
no , i 'm going home . 
her hands and feet were tied . 
ya just had a turn . it was not . 
more than your writing 's at stake . the ministry has threatened us with closure . 
know what we need , man ? ... some rope . 
maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life . 
where are you goin ' , <person> ? did n't you want some chicken and things ? 
eat up , <person> . what 's the matter with your appetite ? 
jeez . think he 's got room for <number> more ? 
grandpa , if you think of something hard enough , can you make it happen ? 
he just completely ignores me . he could have at least said something , introduced me or something . 
really , my dear -- i do n't feel like a thing . 
how many people in the bus ? 
i do n't know . i had to duck to get the story out . he was so far along he never even missed me . 
what 's your bartlett 's ? 
you just put mustard on your hershey bar . 
<person> , i did n't think we were making that much noise . 
you ok ? 
no . this must be a friendship that only we shall have ... you and i ... amy and her friend . 
hi , <person> . 
no idea who . no idea why ... 
that 's what your crew said . are they lying ? or are you ? 
what 's up ? 
yeah . it should be fun . you wan na come ? 
i get off work in fifteen minutes . walk me home ? 
what are you doing in thailand ? tourist ? 
no . it 's not enough ... i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone . 
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this <number> , <person> . 
oh , yes , i am , because < u > afterwards < /u > -- up here in the moonlight . 
well , yeah , that 's part of it . <person> finds out how i live , that i 'm not a published author , that i 'm a liar essentially , then yeah , any interest is gon na evaporate real quick . if you do n't have money at my age , you 're not even in the game . you 're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir . 
but you do n't agree ? 
i can not tell you . suffice to say is <number> of the words the knights of ni ! can not hear ! 
the wire is ten years outa date . 
we been through that . 
you were n't a paper champion . 
no , no ... it was very ... er , nice . 
i 'd like to bomb their emperor too . but i think that 'd just piss 'em off . the idea here , gentlemen , is not revenge . we 're here to prove to them that they 're neither invincible nor superior . so let 's try this again . military targets only . 
a good lay . 
do you want to get it now ? 
i 'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth . 
that 's a picture of me in japan . 
all right- let 's go into battle . i 'm <person> . 
sure . it 's fine . 
be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift . 
just get some people out of our house . 
oh , i do n't know . maybe i was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was <number> of the boys -- 
he owned the entire water supply for the city ? 
you 're daft . what 's <person> to me . he 's only a man from whom i buy what i need when i need it -- the rest is forgotten . 
sure he knew her . her boy <person> , too . 
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony . 
well , thank you for your help . 
your <number> cinnamon rolls . 
with her ? how ? 
what gives ? 
yes you are . i 'm not just some reporter . i do n't just stick a microphone in your face . you could give me something . 
my daughter . 
listen -- i mean i just saw the needle of the empire state building . you ca n't see it for the fog ! 
now , what do you see ? 
yo , rock . i made a few phone calls an ' thanks to me ya goin ' to be a big man -- thatta dog ? 
oh , <person> -- have you seen sally around ? 
bird ! ask me the name of my sailboat -- 
what is your husband 's profession ? 
most folks around here got no use for nigrahs . <person> to understand them , that 's all . how you doin ' , boy ? 
what do you want ? 
what book ? 
no , mother ! it 's war ! war ! 
a body . 
i do n't know what 's going on . i -- 
look at that . he 's got <number> apes with him . 
you got me , commander . 
you know , you 're not the easiest person in the world to get close to . 
i 'm sorry ? 
national ? 
just when we have all the cards , vaughn . take these <number> behind the van . 
yours was fully illustrated , honey . 
do you want to come inside ? 
i do n't expect you to understand . 
i remember it made me sick . 
why do n't you ask <person> ? 
they took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank . 
mrs. kane would like to see you , <person> <person> . 
well , first off , if you were <person> , you would n't be thinking . 
well , you 've got it . and there 's no losing it . and there 's no one to blame . so why quit ? 
you 're joking , right ? i mean , that 's your way of trying to be funny , right ? 
do you feel comforted ? 
are you gettin ' wise with me ? 
no ! 
he 's dead -- good and dead . 
correct me if i 'm wrong . i thought we were on the same side . what the hell business is it of theirs to say that ? 
you 're a smart boy , <person> , but there 's somethin ' you ai n't learned yet . a man needs a family . 
maybe he 's just - waiting ... 
what i ca n't understand is why you signed these . if you 'd just let west take care of the paperwork , no one would have known , but you got careless . so when <person> finally told the truth you had to get rid of him , too . 
what ? 
he 's on the telephone . 
i see . you do n't remember assaulting a police officer ... several officers ? 
yeah . 
i 've seen it twice . i went back tonight to be sure . it 's a brave and honest piece of work . 
i 'm worried about <person> . his stress level is affecting his work . 
have they proceeded with their experiments ? 
you know as much about it as i do . i have n't seen him in <number> months . 
why not ? 
we 're wasting time . 
how about a ginger ale ? 
i 'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation . so i 'm going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition ... 
sharks ? ? ? 
wow . that 's more than a dress . that 's an <person> <person> movie . 
what 's the matter ? 
and is foley a part of this ? 
do n't dismiss me . i 'm trying to include you in this decision . he 's your friend . 
well <person> ai n't gettin ' here . we 're on our own . now , i do n't know a goddamn body who can help him , so if you know somebody , call 'em . 
tell him you want to see him ? 
... and then we 'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and ... and we 'll ... then you 'll sleep over and then in the morning ... ... you 'll be distant and you wo n't be ... able to stay for breakfast ... you 'll just have some coffee maybe ... 
we have <number> months of work and approximately no money left to support it ... . 
you should n't have said that . 
the first night ? 
that 's my real name ! currently i 'm a singer . sort of . 
i did n't imagine it . i know what i saw . are you sure there are enough men in there ? 
it-but it-it ... does n't make any sense . he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound . so-how is it possible for <person> to have fired from <number> angles at once ? it does n't make sense . 
bela , i 'm on your side . c'mon , give me the gun ... if you give me the gun , i 'll make you a drink . what are you drinking ? 
they 're gon na rape the maid , are n't they . 
tell me . 
that coward . <person> of a bitch . 
i do n't know . um , he 's working , but there 's a lot of data . maybe ... another hour ? 
we blew the horn resounding . 
c-18 . 
but <person> , you do n't have to ! 
what do you think it is ? 
i ca n't give you that . this guy 's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years . he 's been getting it from every end . i 'd love to hear his story . 
you know , i 've thought about that , actually . 
they 're nothing but farmers and you 're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard . they 'd be better off letting it move on . 
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want . i 'll be long gone . besides , who 's going to believe you ? you 're just a two-bit crook . 
yeah . 
i 'm just an investigator , <person> . i leave the theories to you lawyers . 
call <number> . call <number> right now . 
... made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back ... cut him loose . 
what is it ? 
what the fuck are you doing ? 
you must have done something to her . 
yes i can ... oh look , let me do that for you , shall i ? 
oh . 
i 'm out , frank . you lost faith in me . 
them kids ! 
i sit . i think . i play games . 
why are n't you on board ? 
i want you to stay , okay ? i goddam invited you , did n't i ? 
but there was an attack . i can still see them coming . there was a fight , was n't there ? 
they 're going to start the final resettlement now . we know what it means . we sent someone out . <person> . a good man . his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw . he got to sokolow . a local railwayman told him the tracks are divided , <number> branch leading to treblinka . he said every day freight trains carrying people from <person> forked to <person> and returned empty . no transports of food are ever seen on that line . and civilians are forbidden to approach the treblinka station . they 're exterminating us . wo n't take them long . we 're sixty thousand left . out of half a <number> . mostly young people . and this time we 're going to fight . we 're in good shape . we 're organised . we 're prepared . 
i ca n't believe you were dumb enough to come down . now you 're stuck here for the storm ... dumb , hot-rod ... dumb . 
i do n't understand . living ... .selection is computed . you ca n't ... what have you done to luh ? she was here.. 
no . 
like i 'm supposed to know what that even means . 
do n't , <person> -- do n't doubt yourself -- do n't make me doubt you . 
too late . i 've tried . i think you 're right , jake . i 'm game . 
do you miss it ? 
what time did this thing happen ? 
did it go well , darling ? 
i do n't , but ... i do . it 's just ... i love you , <person> . i do n't want you to ... 
am i ? 
i am lighten . can we drop this ? 
do n't talk about <person> . 
this ? 
chet ! 
and you 'll be in all evening ? 
what ! 
you said they 've run guns , in their trucks . so they 'll have guns . to do this robbery . they 'll have serious guns . 
not good enough . you 're the person who floated this amnesia story . ever feel sorry for him ? for what he 'd been through ? 
<number> years . 
just move on . no one here killed him . 
oh , man , there you go again . 
... mean through the tubes ? 
what would you call it ? 
you know what i mean . would you ... let yourself get pregnant ? 
you 've got to eat something agnes . 
i ca n't go out . 
... and maybe the king will give you some money , and a little land , and a title even ... ... would n't that be a fine thing ? you , a lady of title ! 
so . anything else ? 
i do n't know why , but every time he opens his mouth i want to punch him out . 
you know , <person> <person> . `` oh , <person> '' . `` camptown races '' , stephen-stinkin'-foster ! 
guess we 're goin ' over to the `` <person> <person> '' .

goodnight . do n't worry . i wo n't keep her out late . 
his body was found on january <number> , <number> , but do you know if that was long after he had died ? 
i mean , okay , fine , but it 's a motion < u > <person> < /u > . 
my monsters ? 
i know that ... 
i never saw any baby ... i think they made it up . 
there 's an empty taxi across the street . if you 're so anxious , take it . he 'll know the way to the police headquarters . 
this is sad news , be it true . 
adam , that 's not true ! 
why not ? 
we are always going to be all right tomorrow . i 'd like to be all right a few todays . 
can i go now ? 
yes , sir .

i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning , before <person> comes back , i mean , if you 'd like to . 
we 'll need room . the sixth rib goes . 
come on now ... you ca n't sit here . 
maybe it 's the time to do something , is n't it ? 
right now . 
you are so full of shit ... 
put - him - down ! his - his heart ... 
she 's probably smash you in the fucking face . 
you believe me , do n't you ?

because i 'm really trying , you know . <person> says maybe only another <number> years of the elctrolysis . 
not since last night . he took a guy hunting . 
no , i mean was it right away or in the night or when was it . 
looks a little constipated to me . 
thas ' it , thas ' it ... conquer that bitch . what time 're they coming ? 
i 'll tell you why . because when i was little , i had a fat cousin , cousin <person> . and he used to make fun of the handicapped . and <number> day he had a bad stomachache . so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off . 
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ? 
i got something you ca n't resist . i have a friend , tracey . she wants to meet you . she loves to please . 
yeah , i 'm going to take a shower and i 'll meet you downstairs .

henceforth you shall be ... little wilbur . 
i can look after myself ! 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
that 's what i 've come to ask you . is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing ? 
what is it ? 
aww , naw , <person> , that wo n't be necessary . i should n't send it ; she 's just doing her job , i guess . 
oh , gosh no .

i do n't know ! i just want to get married . 
i saved your life . 
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective . they hang you for that , <person> . 
right . 
bruce , much to my surprise , you seem like a really great guy ... 
there 's nothing in it ! 
seriously ? 
i ... i thought it was great . i loved it . it was nothing to these guys ... medium deal . 
please ... butterfield ... i was n't there . <person> <person> . 
my friends buy me clothes , so i do n't look like trash . 
you 're wrong . they 're fascinating . like in a dream ... there 's truth without logic . what 's his name again ... ? picasso . 
a claymore to be exact . you would n't know anything about it would you ? 
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and <person> out of trouble was to send us to big daddy 's farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama 's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . <person> will never have to bust his knuckles like we did . 
remarkable aircraft . remarkable .

<person> christ . that 's a real blockbuster . i always figured you guys had it made . 
oh , and your line to <person> <person> in there : `` i 'll take that gun '' , `` you 'll have to '' . 
i 'll have the blackbeard over easy . 
it is important to assure the succession . 
i had a question , <person> prime minister . i was examining some of the maharajah 's artifacts .

and are you familiar with fema ? what the federal emergency management agency 's real power is ? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . to create a non-elected government . think about that . what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas ? 
to a party in the hollywood hills . 
why not ? 
i 'm sorry , it 's just that i did n't think that you people were supposed to admit -- 
yeah . 
... and that <person> dinner , when <person> made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we would n't hurt her feelings ! i do remember so much now , <person> , - but not everything . 
if she was the right girl , you 'd be thinking about her . 
dan -- what do we do now ? 
together , you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone . 
i 'd like to - but it may be rather difficult . 
bernie , how'sa kid ? 
oh , <person> –– i 'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen . 
me ? i 'm busy . just finished <number> script . i 'm due on another assignment .

but i think i like you better this way ... 
who 's been talking to you ? the army ? have they been talking to you , huh ?

i see you have your <person> <person> . 
<person> up such talk , <person> ! 
take it easy , <person> .

it was n't a lunatic . 
tell me , how many people a week do you foreclose on ? 
you know chastity ? 
to a city with thousands and thousands of people .

gwpaapa . <person> . 
i ca n't help it . you do n't know ... .. 
do i have to ? 
pipe down , lech . let him order . 
i can help you . 
teddy . your buddy . 
you 're more than kind . but it 's still <person> <person> 's performance . i 'm just a carbon copy you read when you ca n't find the original ... 
i told you what they said . 
what about your friendly cop ? 
oh , you do n't appreciate it . her pictures do n't do her justice . why , <person> , she 's queenly - she is queenly - and i know queens ! and oh , has she got herself a nose - and i know noses too . that little snozzle of hers is the berries , i tell you . and is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens ! 
do n't hurt me ! do n't hurt me ! 
you see , all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do n't rely on heat seeking ... 
i told <person> <number> o'clock . 
all of it . 
whaddyamean 'maybe ' ? 
here . it looks like you need a refill . 
whaddya been so far ? 
and just think -- right now there 's some lucky girl in the building who 's going to come after me -- 
thank you , sergeant major . 
and you believe that ? 
i do n't know ; i really do n't . the last time i saw it was when i was in washington . i gave it to the finance department of the committee to re- elect the president . how it got to that burglar , your guess is as good as mine . 
actually , no . 
glad to meet you , winifred . 
shut up , miss henried ! i tol ' ya b'fore ! 
fuck you . you a hoto . 
it is dangerous to be here . the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches . 
... it 's a tenement building . on the lower east side ... 
and when is the next lesson ? 
he 's in charge . 
you wo n't remember this , but in <number> i was <number> of several prosecutors assigned to the black panther-police shootout . we had a whole team , and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt . so what 've you been up to since then ? 
big . <person> , show him the oils . 
how did you know our nanny 's name is ... lucky guess ! 
dog , i have found the cash ! 
i did n't know you were a kebab man , <person> . 
and beat it at it 's own game . 
what , it 's worse ? you 're pregnant with an asian design major 's child ? 
it 's still just death , the absence of life -- no honor at all . it 's worse than the blue soup by far -- that nothingness . to you , though , it 's the honor that crowns them all . 
ruben . 
h-e-z-t ... 
twenty-five thousand for clothes . 
some guys from <person> <person> jumped <person> today ; slit his throat from ear to ear . 
you lame <person> ? 
like a virgin with an ' urgin ' in a surgery i 'll be swinging -- i 'll be bringing out the nurse in me 
freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun . he 's about to turn <person> into an ice cube . 
without him . the guy 's so out of it he does n't even know it 's gone . 

is n't that ridiculous ? 
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation -- 
ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you , <person> <person> . do n't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes -- 
that 's your friend <person> ? 
what about him ? 
you 're perplexing to me these days , <person> . you 're not your old , cruel self anymore . i need proof that the extracurricular work i had planned for you remains within your grasp . 
if you 're hiding something ... oh , oh , i 'll have so much fun . 
no . 
so am i . 
hello ? last birthday was ? 
well , i know that i lost my job because of <number> meeting i went to when i was a kid in college . i know that i 've been branded a communist , which i 'm not , but even if i was , it should n't matter , or what do we have a bill of rights for ? 
i did n't expect to see you . 
she took care of the dealers ... 
mummy ! 
who is he ? 
no . it 's the truth , really . i swear it . <person> told me . he went up into <number> of the bedrooms , the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub . she tried to strangle him .

we will never 'evacuate ' , captain -- this is our home . indochina is ours ; it has been so for a <number> and <number> years , there is something to say for that . 
have you not a man whom you value ? 
fossils , huh ? 
how ? 
... what all the bullshit about the cash was , was n't it ? ! you stole this truck , and now you 're trying to sell ... 
a doll alone proves nothing . <person> . but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit . 
can i trouble you for <number> of those magazines ? 
yeah , it 's just this fucked-up building . * why are we going there ? 
all right , say `` <person> ho-jo . '' 
do you expect me to believe ... ? 
need a little help with that , mr collins ? 
oh ! <person> <person> ! what a dream i 've had ... proper nightmare . 
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ? 
there 's a great deal i have to show you , i 'm not even sure where to start there 's so little time . 
i 'll go first . 
uh , <person> ? ! we missed the truck ! 
and ? 
yes -- on the boat . 
someone from the past .

he crept up these stairs and made his way into this room . his sister 's room . <person> here . where it all began . 
this is <person> 's coke ? 
those are n't real memories . no one has that kind of recall . 
it 's too soon to move him . 
transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink . 
just who the fuck do you think you are ? ! get out ! you 're fired ! 
find the jacket . 
you 've got a right to be . we 're trapped by a bunch of fiends . 
how can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and ... who are you ? were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table ? tell me ! please tell me who you are ; you own me that ! 
how much is what ? 
i 'm canceling the mixer . we 'll blacklist <person> <person> .

oh -- good evening , <person> . 
i do n't know . i felt like it . i never saw anyone get done before . 
you bet we made it . <person> , set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive . 
this really is n't a good time . 
you are birth of ... what ? a phenomenon . a miracle . a new era in show business . all i wanted to do was finish the film . 
i heard your mother took sick , that so ?

you need n't bother . i ca n't drag you further into this . after all , i am still the chief suspect . 
i 'll do anything for you . 
say , ... did you just lose your job because of me ? 
i 'd like you to close your eyes . 
wow . that must 've taken some courage . 
yearbooks always set you out for disappointment , i want mine to say : <person> probably wo n't amount to much , so do n't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again . can we go ? ... it smells like someone left their gym bag in here .

c'est bien , vous vous promenez bien matin , monsieur ! 
from what i 've seen , <person> <person> , you have a very good case ... 
did you ever work with her ? 
hey , i thought you were gon na mention us upstairs . 
egon , how 's the grid around the storage facility holding up ? 
she lies all the time . why would i say i fed her if i did n't ? 
daddy ! 
i do n't know . 
for the artistic effect . the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask . it 's quite striking . 
no dead body . too bad . not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there . exclusive ! 
you 're an artist . i 'm a craftsman . 
but i 'm better than a detective . i have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - - 
bravo ! what about all the other hundreds of prisoners ? do we let them go too ? 
yes . 
i did n't think you did . if you had , i would n't have asked you again , because i 'd have remembered . how old ? 
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself ? 
come on , tell me . 
facing your fear does n't always conquer it . 
you are going to drive to the frontier . 
what about the others . 
i admit , i know nothing of your culture . 
i know . it 's for the baby 's crib . 
i ca n't stay here ! i 'll crack up ! <person> , what am i gon na do ?

juno ? what 's going on ?

it 'll hurt the box office . 
roy ? 
hesitated , sir . 
that wo n't be necessary . she 's staying with a rosa something ... <person> , <person> . i know it 's an 'h ' sound ... in silverlake . 
you want to put in chain saws ?

it was planted on me , sir . 
she 's fuckin ' crazy , she killed the kid ! she just killed her own kid ! 
what about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the `` <person> '' ? was n't that a computer glitch ? 
i know but this is different . he 's a crazy man . he might kill you . 
hollywood . 
fucking chick 's married . 
it 's false sentimentality . 
what the hell 's going on ? 
<person> <person> , i could have <number> of them ready by tomorrow .

all i 'm asking is you test it beforehand ! 
his company made us .

they become complicated ... messy . 
well ... to shore up product identification and preserve market share . 
where are you taking me ? 
call me . 
where is your daughter ? she might be able to give us some information . 
joan or <person> <person> .

how 's school ? 
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world . nothing really bad is going to happen , is it <person> <person> ? 
que va hacer ? 
working . 
none taken . 
do you have any idea what would happen if that broke ? ! 
... i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal . he 's sure he can get you off on self-defense , so if you 're patient . 
that 's not correct . where 'd you hear that ? 
you know her ? 
no . go back to the woods . this is a sacrifice i need to make . in my world we have something called penance . it 's another abstraction , but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent . it does n't exist for you , and it should n't . see , i could never be free again anyway , so i might as well be in jail . 
why should i mind ? 
frank gone ? 
wyoming ? not cody , by any chance ? 
how did you find out ? 
hey , man , good to see you .

uh -- <person> <person> ? 
`` when i grow up i 'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian . i always want to help people and value all life , be it animal , plant or mineral ... '' does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you ? 
really ? what else did he tell you today ? give me some gossip . 
this <number> came back and was never seen again . i understand <person> looked after him . 
i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up . 
that 's right . i was raised very strictly . so do n't speak before you are spoken to ! 
well , it 's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented . 
why do n't you want to go to your high school reunion ? 
you think that 's the answer ? sex ? is that what you want ? you want me to make love to you ? 
his father worked in a strip mine north of here . <person> 's school class went up to the mine <number> day . <person> takes field trips up there every year . big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground . <person> , on this particular day <person> 's dad up and falls into the machinery .

i do n't understand . do you want my autograph ? 
would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her ? 
yes , it is -- 
what difference does it make ? 
that is the question of the hour . we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization . an ant of termite colony , for example , is ruled by a single female , a queen , which is the source of new eggs . 
quitting your therapy wo n't feed the children of ethiopia . 
<person> .

she 's beautiful . 
yes ? 
he 's doing it to spite me , i tell you , and it 's got to stop !

let 's go . 
i do n't know , kate . i just said that . i 'm sorry . i 'm just on edge . i 'm afraid we 're losing him .

you believe that ? 
ai n't it the truth ? 
tell me , dr. schwartz , what do you feel you can bring to lestercorp ?

<person> , <person> , we 're standing in the heart of the united states government 's intelligence community in new orleans . that 's the fbi there , the cia , secret service , oni . does n't this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time ?

smart for your age , eh ? top of your class ? tell me , do you know what the word & quot ; propaganda & quot ; means ? 
i saw you sitting over here . by yourself . i thought , thank god , someone normal , who does n't know how interact at these things either .

what 's the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ? 
you lied to me about those school books . i found them upstairs on your bed .

he must be replaced . 
because i hate him -- because i love you !

from their tone of voice on the phone , i 'd say they 're taking us more seriously . 
nice try , old girl . i 'd like to help you out . you know , for old time 's sake . but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture , and i have n't collected my profits yet . too bad . you caught me at the wrong time .

<person> chris , this is <person> <person> . 
i happen to be a professional . 
i know where everything is . 
i do n't see why we have to invite everyone . 
give them here . this tells you how the women 's <person> <person> came to be set up . all local women at first , then we had support from women and men all over the country . 
come on , let 's give it a dry run . 
vat ? 
i really do n't want to see anybody . 
does n't fit . 
yeah , right . anyway , that scene where <person> <person> and <person> <person> get shot ? i remember thinking at the time it would n't be a bad way to go , if you have to . 
says me . do you dream often ? 
you must find the ring ... it completes the cycle ; answers the riddle ... 
<person> ! why did n't you tell me before ? 
he 's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay ! they 're going to be shooting at him ! 
it 's okay , <person> . 
about yourself ? 
wait . you 're not wearing that ironically ? this is really you ? 
when you saw your king for the first time , was there an angel over his head ?

i have no control , sir ! 
hello . 
i can read . i can read ! 
domini ? 
sure , he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own <number> feet and all that jazz ! 
no . we have tomatoes . 
excuse me , <person> <person> , but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs . the cashier would like some money . 
yeah ? what 's his name ? 
what are you doing ? 
i do n't think that 's so revealing . 
ah , my fool is dead . he was careless , always . still , i 'll pull out your tongue for that . do n't you understand ? i 've killed you a dozen times . your life is not a blink of my eye , not a single breath . i have lived in the shadows , in the pulsing filth behind men 's eyes . a <number> years , and more . i have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and i have bathed in the blood of emperors . 
that crazy brother of yours does n't think so . 
it does n't have to be 
me ? why would he be interested in me ? 
i never saw anything like that in my life ... except molecular acid . 
what i love . 
so there 's <number> thing we know ambrose does n't . 
... i ran the bio-scan with the dna/rna filter . the results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin ... 
and on tuesdays , i take a course in general semantics at berkeley . that 's not a job , of course . i just take it because ... 
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance ? i can do that ? 
not bad for eleven dollars a day . 
more proof god 's a guy ... 
okay . 
my name is <person> . this is my house . 
i know . <person> , we need to take a time out here . can we talk seriously for a minute ? 
i 'm curious to see what it 's like . i 'm very curious , <person> . 
you could ? how ? 
uh-huh . 
i 'm fired ? because i let a ... copy of a painting the get stolen ? 
that is n't the way it works . 
and instead , i came -- bringing you nothing . 
... why take me into your confidence ? 
what 's the horse pill for , honey ? 
this sounds threatening . 
walk , just walk . <person> walking . 
i 'm not being defensive . 
was this him ? 
think about something else . 
what about which girlfriend ? 
tie up <person> , too . 
listen , snoopy , i 'm on my way up to detroit and need a place to crash . 
do n't say `` bill , '' bernie ! do n't say one word ! did n't i say `` <number> word and you 're fired ? '' 
yes , i 'm here ... 
so , how did you get hooked up with these guys ? 
a lie . what do you hate most ? 
okay , that 's it . you 're going back to -- 
why did you wait so long ? 
that 's not the play . <person> 'll get a shot off . i can still talk to him , nate , i just need time . 
do you have any particular reason to say that ? 
let 's talk about it some other time . 
<person> . 
we won . 
wannabes . <person> transitioned last year . 
thank you , sir . i 'm sorry i embar- rassed you . 
he certainly is polite . 
i ca n't believe i 'm doing this . i ca n't believe i 'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night . 
nothing like this back home . 
what 's that outside , <person> ? 
do you wan na go tonight ? i mean , are you working ? 
here we go . 
let me see it . 
can i just sit here while you 're packing ? 
what will we talk about ? 
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter . that 's partly why i was in custody so long . sixty days . 
i am not responsible for your assumptions . 
<person> <person> used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed , with a lacy cushion to bank her head up . if you 'd only seen her , <person> <person> . she looked so pretty . 
mmm . 
i will , frank , i will . something came up , okay ? 
trix ... 
when ? 
look , i can understand if you and <person> are close .

you will . 
look . 
you mean we 'd be dead ? 
i 'm getting a chest cold.. 
and hey , i appreciate it ... 
on your sleeve . 
but what ? 
i hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this , <person> <person> <person> . i called to bring this to your son , but i understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon . 
i can deliver <person> . but you got ta get me outta here first . 
take a deep breath and realize , that this is me breathing . 
have we got something for you . something which will make you love me so much you 'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life . 
before <person> disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin . 
but why ? why ? 
i believe you . i believe you want to be with me . but this is not just about me anymore . 
that was n't a good night , no . 
i designed it myself . what 'll it be ... a face job or a full-body job ? 
`` if '' i accept ? ! of course i 'm going to accept ! it 's what i always wanted ! 
that road -- and those orinco trucks -- are the <number> main reasons it 's there . 
all right , <person> , we 'll be in touch with you on the communicator . 
we should go . 
what brand 'd she smoke ? 
<person> knox . <person> <person> . 
and the chopsticks and fortune cookies ? 
which part ? 
<person> , norman . <number> minutes .

mmmmmm . 'course , you could get yourself a boat , cut right across the bay with it . the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at . if that 's what you wanted to do . 
go on . 
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future . 
i was n't trying . 
and remember , <person> : no skag . 
it 's better ... you see , it 's my turf , so i do n't want contracts i 'm not informed about , on my turf . i 'm not opposing , but the least they can do is informing me , is n't it ? 
... they asked us to dinner . how can we accept if we can not < u > return < /u > the ... 
huh ? 
you 're only screwing yourselves over ! helllllp ! helllllp ! somebody ! ! ! 
i wanted to see if he was okay -- 
where did you get that ? 
why would it ? 
think of what ? we 're fucked . 
aye , ma'am . 
you 're not trained for that . none of us are ... i mean , sometimes i ... <person> , let 's say you had gone back . what then ? are you bulletproof ? 
can i help ? 
sera ... you know i 'm not much good in the sack . 
we 've touched on this , his own witness has said ... 
i shared his cell ! 
oh , yeah . <person> nice . who 's your designer ? <person> <person> ? 
and how did you find his work ? 
here 's what i 'm thinking . we move up here , you and me , buy a vineyard . you design your own wine ; i 'll handle the business side . then you get inspired and write a new novel . as for me , if an audition comes along , hell , la 's <number> hours away . not even . 
oh , <person> ... ! 
hey , i just ...

i thought you were an archer ? 
yes . 
neil -- what -- 
where do you want it ? 
she means your neighbor . the scotsman 
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority ? are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for <person> 's lightning rod ? 
when them tricks hit the lobby , holla at me and i 'm gon na meet them on the way up , blend in . once i get inside , i'mma put m'nina to israel 's head and back out hot . <person> 's fucks with that program , y'break 'em off . they get gully --

... we need the shooting permit for <person> <person> ... 
yeah , well , this <number> 's the cadillac of minivans . 
how ' he doing ?

what about you ? are n't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry ? 
all in all , what <person> wants to do is build the golden bridge to <person> with no hard feelings . 
so i 'm gon na act ! ever since i can remember i 've wanted to try it . last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father would n't let me .

and so do i ! 
you 're sure ... 
why do n't you get to the point . 
skip , you know that it 's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with <number> of his patients ? 
somewhere in the middle . 
he 's the greatest *american* we got , too , dad . can tell what <person> <person> said -- by heart . an ' `` boy <person> 's '' got the swellest stuff in it . 
where are you going ?

please ! 
you 're < u > happy < /u > for me and <person> . 
when my folks split , they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with . i could n't stand my dad , but i knew if i moved to my mom 's i 'd never see you again . 
i think so

sit down , man . need a beer ? 
well -- you boys stopped fighting yet ? are you pals now ? good . i love a little macho male bonding -- i think it 's sweet even if it 's probably latent homosexuality being `` re-channeled '' but i believe in `` re-channeling '' so who cares , right ? shall we go to my place ? 
well , i was n't going to say that -- 
courage man , the hurt can not be much . 
i 'm a mirror . 
you do n't have anything to do with it .

that 's my responsibility . 
nope . legal problems , you got ta have a good attorney .

yes . 
so you 're chicken ? 
honey -- 
alright ? 
<person> millaney ? 
what 's your fuckin ' problem ? you get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me . 
her <person> 's routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it . the household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever . as for the queen 's routine , she breakfasts at <number> thirty , lunches at <number> , takes tea at <number> thirty and dinner at <number> forty <number> . no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home . on the rare occasions when she is out , you may ask permission to leave , but only with my consent . you 're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock . you 'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires . 
i told myself that was good . that it made our friendship special . and did n't mean she was ashamed of it . necessarily . 
cotton , i 've done nothing but help you . 
quite . 
i ai n't fuckin ' sure , <person> . 
i 'm brother frank .

y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry . 
... yes potatoes ... but ... 
i had a key . i worked here ... till they closed the shop . 
relax , norville . it 's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover . 
i 'm after news , as usual . i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory ? 
up , up , up . 
you 're a sentimental man . 
whatever it is you 're upset about . 
right now , you 're doing nothing ? 
barbara -- 
sir , i 've always wondered ... why < u > sue < /u > ? you could have any woman in the world but -- 
why does god let there be bad things ? 
fire the whole division . we 're moving more of the operations division into manhattan anyway . whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed . we already have all the key people here . <person> else is expendable . 
to grant ) she 's , uh - - tenacious . 
your parents did n't have a < u > bigger < /u > <number> ? 
another thing ; there 's an old man who lives here on the island ... 
thanks for coming back for me .

he pushed into me ... i could n't stop him ... it hurt . 
i 'm going first . taking the fire . if we go out together we 're all dead ! 
do you know that house ? 
where is she ? 
say what you want and you 'll see -- 
so does anybody have any suggestions ? 
trade for what ? 
do n't thank me , just do it . you 're the slots manager . i should n't have to tell you this . 
a glorified office block . they keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living . 
well ... get going . you 're still bleeding . 
well to be honest , <person> , i would rather have not known about it . 
no fingerprints ? 
what ? 
<person> 's pa -- but how the fuck she seein ' us ? 
almost . want to sit up ? what 's the matter ? 
i wish i could do more but we 're moving out .

sharp shirt , jake ... . 
lestat - finish this - 
okay , <person> , i wish you had n't shot my girlfriend 's dog . even though <person> and i were n't exactly what you 'd call simpatico , that 's no reason for him to take <number> in the chest . still , the fact remains that i 'm the one who took you up into the chancellor 's bedroom . i 'm the one who has to take the blame . i do n't know what the hell i was thinking . 
no , i like the bag . it would be good for the job tonight . 
answer your fucking pages ! i 've been calling for fifteen minutes , we need you up here to clean now ! 
they thought it was a publicity stunt . 
no , it 's not -- 
but she did n't ... did she . if anyone had seen what i 'd seen she 'd be public property ... newspapermen , psychiatrists , ridicule . she does n't deserve that . 
at least you pulled yourself out ... 
we ? 
that 's your idea of logic ? i tell the judge i did n't murder the man - the judge says , `` why not you ? '' 
as if it 's that easy . 
you could work out at the beach , make a few bucks for school . 
you did too . <person> could n't possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you do n't have a brother . 
have you seen this ? 
you 're very attractive , my dear . and you look very unsophisticated . 
all right ... i want you ... to ... kill ... sailor ... as simple as that . 
what kind of crap is that ? ? ? 
that depends on you . <number> woman only used <number> minutes . another filled up <number> <number> hour tapes . 
-- did she talk to you ? 
where 's my mother ? 
did you just now con me ? 
kurten ! is he bothering you ? i told that son i 'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone . 
oooooo . that hurt . 
she 's dead ! 
you got ta be kidding me . this chick is wasted . 
what shape is the scar ? 
is that what they told you ? 
où est passé ton salon ? 
if a man is n't a man anymore , what 's he got left to live for ? 
what do you care ? let 'em have their fun . so , what 's up ? 
that was a mistake , trying to kill you . <person> did it without consulting me , i 'd have never allowed it . 
sure , a rice burning crotch rocket ...

but that 's an hour 's drive . 
i do n't know . it 's been a while . 
<person> ?

well , i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly . 
look , if you ask me everything twice , this is going to take a really long time . and i have to get home to my family . 
i need a favor ... i need you to trace a number for me . 
what ? 
but you have n't put in for emigration . 
you 're perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i 'm with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help . 
burbage , i will see you hanged for a pickpocket . 
she never will . that is my job . it has been for a long time . you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen . i made her a star . i can not let her be destroyed . 
what now ?

here - keep these . it wants me to come alone . 
you 've been very useful , <person> , we appreciate all you 've done , and now the professional will take over ...

does the name <person> <person> mean anything to you ? 
i figure we 'll get along just fine . 
bullets ? no bullets ! oh my gosh , these are just to scare people . <person> like round-off , back handspring , whip back , double full . you never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you 've got it . 
no , it should be over soon . 
are you sure you 're okay ? 
where you coming from ? 
sit your suspect out in the cold . he 'll keep . 
and heat and chemical reactions . where does it all go when you die ?

you knew ? all this time ? 
jade .

does n't matter what it 's called , <person> 's got <person> <person> and it 's gon na be big . 
in many ways , the church-bound tradition of the father , son , and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all . it 's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology . 
yeah ! listen to this part . this is where it really takes off ! 
who 's she ? 
shorty , why do n't you say grace ?

you were n't abused , you are n't stupid , and as far as i can tell , you 're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you 're such a fuck-up ? 
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ? 
$ <number> . 
that 's my lovin ' man . just ca n't get enough . 
maybe we should soap your hand or something . 
we decided the night before last , before we came up here ... 
is n't there something you can give him ? a pill or something ? 
he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street ... 
not much time . 
no news is not good news . y'know 
i 'm not gon na kill it . 
someone who smokes french cigarettes . 
it helps me concentrate ... . so does that mean you 're a white supremacist ? 
was i picking on you ? how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand ? 
how will you fight <person> <person> ? 
i did n't knock <person> off . 
are you alright ? 
i was told that your mother died . that your mother died when you were young -- 
what kind of trouble . 
better re-load it . 
damn it , child ! now look what you made me do . 
what does that mean ? 
and what next ? popcorn ? <person> calls ? this is not a theater . or a casino . 
the hell i ca n't ! we get in there and we can stop him . 
tell you what . i 'll book you on some concerts , and meanwhile , we 'll show the special around ... see if somebody wants to buy it -- 
look , i have n't really focused on that kind of thing . 
somehow , i got the feeling that did n't help us very much . 
dignan . you 're going to give me those keys or you 're going to get hurt . 
yes sir . 
no sir . i was just getting , well you know . <person> . we were n't talking about sex or anything else except <person> <person> . just saying hello . i think i 'm gon na go now . 
oh , i do n't know . it was an accident . 
it is always less with my living . <person> or near . but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before . there is power in this . and as long as you and i live , the knight can never have it all . 
french guys ? you mean like from france ? 
okay ... how about um .. <number> a ounce . 
you had no inner feeling ? 
oh , american , thank you . i like them . 
that 's all right . what are you going to do about emily ? 
<person> asked to see you before you leave . 
that headboard . 
do you need anything ? you want me to come in ? 
yeah , <person> <person> ? 
you have forty-eight seconds left . <person> . <person> . 
the switch . hit the switch .

now , hold on there . i ai n't pullin ' no shit . it 's my money , i can do whatever the fuck i wan na do with it . 
mexico . 
i know what you 're going to say but do n't say it . these drinks are all on the tab . i 'm gon na see you this tuesday payday , i promise . i give you my word . 
i 'm told unusual promises were made to wigand . 
he 's hot . 
<person> <person> ! 
he 's a she ! 
i 'm going on staff at the n.s.f . to work for <person> . 
yeah , he 's in there . 
what 's your twenty ? 
i understand . how often do you see your son ? 
evone tells me : i shoulda been in , fi , <number> , months ago ... . thizz my first checkup . 
are you ready ? 
i do n't know . i 've never thought about it ... what was the most exciting place you 've ever been to ? unless you 're tired of talking about it . 
what is it ? 
what is it about men and nudity ? particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them ? 
showed him a hell of a lot more than that . 
which part ? the colonel 's ? or yours ? 
then what ? 
you may not like this , chief , but you 're beginning to act paranoid . i mean , you really are . 
were you in jail ? 
you 're not a film producer , are you ? 
that would be okay . 
<person> <number> thousand , <number> hundred . 
we 're very unhappy . 
you did n't give that boy all your money ? 
um . there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make <person> <person> in command . 
goddammit ! 
no . 
that 's the thing . i have this condition . 
a very tired <number> . i 've been up all night - and i would .like to rest before the funeral . have your lawyer - 
from the beastie boys collection ? 
you 're making things up , frank . 
hey , <person> . 
i hear you 're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything . i 'm glad you 've stayed clean . 
do n't worry -- i 'm fine . 
why did she call me ? 
flynn ... <person> 's ram ? 
i 've been as close to them as anyone . but not close enough for real observation ... 
are you sure ? that 's what i thought . 
who ? ! 
fame . 
no . 
the walkers spoke very highly of you . 
i 'll destroy them when we get back to paris . 
his grace is very angry with you . 
nope . if you 're a criminal you do n't carry id , and if you do you 're a damn fool . 
i could n't believe ... did you see the size of that thing 's mouth ? 
<person> . do you suppose <person> could just bring her crutches ? oh , stupid question . tell her i hope she feels better . <person> 's mother , she ca n't baby-sit tonight . 
<number> me , but it was superstition ... foolish , childish wishes ... that started , all this . 
gray has no need to threaten . you remember the trial ? 
well , i do remember why i started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in new york with <person> -- we were trying to do something important , shine a light in that darkened cinema -- 
stop busting my hump ... . 
what were you dreaming about ? 
in hiding . he sent <person> to talk to me . 
god , karen johnson . 
that information 's being withheld from the media . 
we 're fine . <person> . we 're all well . we 're okay ! that man , crawford , called and ... told me ... ... how 'bout a drink ? coffee or something ? 
i perfectly understand where you 're coming from . as a minority i can relate to your struggle also . but i think you should give us all a chance . we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you . please do n't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness . 
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . 
thanks for callin ' in ... and i guess maybe ... look , i 'm sorry i called you watermellon nigger ... those kinds of things . i was just leanin ' on ya , doin ' my job . 
good morning . 
what do you need ? 
you know what i want you to do ? get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert , then let 'em show you where it 's at . 
you tricked me . 
go to the infirmary ... get the cart .. oxygen ... de-fib kit ... adrenaline in a ... ten cc syringe ... and some ... heating blankets . you got all that ? 
listen to this one ... the commander says to the sergeant : 'you remember that windmill that used to be there ? ' <number> , sir , i remember the mill 's gone but the wind 's still there ! ' you remember the story of the soldier and the princess ? 
and you let her get away . 
okay . you know what ? watch your fucking language , alright ? or i might have to . 
shame you had to spot i wasn ’ t the real thing . 
is that the question ? 
you 're not such a bargain , you know , conceited and thoughtless and messy- 
and scary . 
chet 's parents do n't know about it , so please keep it quiet . but you can bring someone if you like . 
but i have in india- every country presents problems . 
look , i 'm sorry . they 're assholes ! but we work in a creative business . you ca n't predict what people are gon na like -- 
where you gon na go ? 
ballast . 
could n't stay away . you running mixture for us ? good . could n't ask for better . 
major <person> said he 'd call to let us know . 
hmmm . you say he showed you his garden ? 
but maybe you can change all that . 
turn 'em up . 
wait a minute . what does the chairman do ? 
question withdrawn , you may step down . 
are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin ' around in there with a pocket knife ? 
no . my ship was doing a map of all the suns and ... 
you did n't ? 
what ? 
no . 
what ? 
absolutely . 
your thoughts betray you , father . i feel the good in you ... the conflict . 
no , but you sucked enough dick ! 
i 've read a great deal about your new york city . do be a dear and tell me all about it . sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life . 
but what if they fall into somebody else 's hands , why - uh— 
there 's something very dangerous about her . something evil ... 
they 'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch . that 'll help . 
i 've got ta kill some jews , <person> . i 'm serious . i 'm always talking about it . this time it 's got ta happen . 
that 's the way i 've always wanted it to be , elaine . 
... you keep pouring out that suppressing fire , <person> . i do n't wan na be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me ? 
oooo . 
that 's me . i 've been ionized , but i 'm okay . i 'm , switching on the homing beacon , mark <number> minute intervals . 
a cheese-eater ! you 're kidding ! 
edna ! come dance with me ! let 's be foolish tonight . 
whatta you mean ... 
you forget what i went through to give ya the best . 
during a campaign every speech is important . this is free media exposure . primetime news coverage that we could n't buy . 
you have an active imagination . 
i was acting in the town 's best interests ... 
i 'm not gon na rag you . why would i do this just to rag you ? 
i 'll answer anything . 
that 's right . 
they do n't put them in the torah . i 'll get you a chumash , they 'll have them there ... bet ... <person> ... <person> ... hay ... how come you 're here instead of with <person> ? besides the hebrew lessons ... 
until last night . did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party ? 
they 're operating on him . he 's still alive . 
what 's the b-g 's ? 
... i make <number> deliveries . the first one with ten <number> , like a dry run . they watch it . see how it works . then we do a second delivery , when i bring in the half mill . 
i wan na know your thinking , i wan na know how someone like you thinks . did you think you could get away with it , did you think you could put something over on me ? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people 's backs and taking advantage of them ? maybe that 's your idea of being anti establishment ! 
cut out my heart ! throw my liver to the dogs ! 
do n't call me ever again . 
yeah , or d , it 's a dumb fucking idea ... 
really ? 
rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however , it does n't affect what we are talking about . please go on . 
who did this ? 
can there be ... some kind of test ? to find out who 's what ? 
where 's the plow ? 
he 's learning his letters . 
no , no , no , no , no , no . . . 
we 're screwed . 
look , pal , if you 're still here when i finish this drink , i 'm callin ' the police . 
then i 'll be there for you . 
you ca n't leave yet . the doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system . 
is that everybody ? 
do like the soldier , <person> ! go away ! this land is cursed . when you 're here every day you feel like you 're at the center of the universe , it seems like nothing ever changes . then you go away , <number> year , <number> ... and when you come back , everything 's different . the thread has broken . you do n't find those you were looking for , your things no longer exist . is n't that the case ? ... you 've got to go away a long time , for many , many years , before coming back and finding your people again , the land where you were born ... but not now , it 's impossible . now you 're blinder than i am . 
i 'll get dr <person> , we can trust him . 
i have heard of it . -- reverend mother it is very dangerous ... very painful . the bene gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within ... . there is a place terrifying to us ... to women . it is said a man will come ... the kwisatz haderach ... he will go where we can not ... many men have tried ... 
you sound like that all the time . 
it 's enough is n't it ? 
or was it toronto ? 
did she throw up ? 
then you have never loved ? your heart is empty . 
richie , will you do me a favor and eat my pussy ? 
we sure did , but we had to go in hiding for a week . 
we know what 's going on . 
the country boy 's about due . 
<person> ? 
mister . i 'm begging , 'kay ? i 'm begging . this is not some card club , 'kay ? this is the tomahawk . we 're an international gaming destination . we 're in guidebooks . you ca n't do this ... you ca n't do this to me ... 
i mean , how did that happen ? 
only you . 
<person> took her from us . 
that 's the boy . 
excuse me ? 
not if you do n't grow up ... 
i asked , but ya never helped nothin ' ! -- like the bible sez , ya do n't get no second chance . 
the hip , cool , sexy thing was getting old ... 
los , los . <person> ! 
-- the canuck letter -- was that a white house operation -- 
anything but the jayer richebourg ! 
dinosaurs . all of us . the ice age is now ... 
it sure is a beautiful old hotel . 
how did you get so many ? 
no . never had much use for hell-howlers . you goin ' ? 
you did n't . 
it ca n't be . it 's impossible . 
well , what about artificial insemination ? 
calf love . i loved the writer , and gave up the prize for a sonnet . 
help the senator , give him whatever he wants . 
got a bogey , boss ? 
and ? 
what she 's got . nine knots ... . 
i say i 've got it . 
oh , geez . 
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery . a d-6 is <number> inch wider than a d-8 . it would be too large for the deceased 's well . 
and <person> ? 
no it 's not . do you know how you did it <person> ? 
you hit a bad streak . we 've all ... look at this : fifteen units <person> <person> , the fucking things get stole . 
i 'm sorry if i was in the way . it was totally impressive . great piece . 
well that 's a lot of land . you must have help . do you have field hands that help you ? 
oh , do n't use her like that , for a smoke screen . 
coz he thinks you 're a witness . 
love is different for different people . 
later when ? 
it 'd cost you . 
does it still hurt ? 
totalled together , these <number> checks from <number> different accounts , they equal <number> <number> dollars . 
you mean nobody died ? 
<person> developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator is n't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real . 
easy , chief . i ... i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all . 
early . still dark . 
that would be impossible . 
<person> ? my <person> ? what 's happened ? 
sure ... i figured i 'd see you sometime ... 
is that right ? 
depends on where you want to go ... . 
well , if it is n't the little frenchman ! how is the little frenchman ? 
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure . 
keep it . 
what 's it called ? 
you know , sometimes i wish i was <number> of those girls they 're letting in the flight program these days . god , i 'd love to fly . 
you would n't understand . i come from great darkness and deep peace 
nah . i 'll probably just be here studying for finals . the joys of summer school ... are you okay ? 
the power . 
... for my kid rudy -- <number> years old , electronics freak , got a liquid crystal display <number> of an electronic beam . we 're going into a new age pal . so how 's business today . 
switch seats with me . 
i lost <number> pounds ... 
can you move the ice afterwards ? i do n't know nobody who can move ice . 
by <person> , i wish i knew . 
i 'm sorry , darling , have you seen my coffee mug ... ? 
did he get you the job ? 
miss her ? 
not even a stalemate ? 
a 9,000-hectacre lake , honey . 
i 'm the king of the world . 
oh really ? what 's the verdict ? 
but listen , <person> . if you 're lying to me ... 
i 'm assuming you read my deposition . 
we shall attack at once . 
i write poetry . 
is n't this ridiculous , <person> ? six months i 've been here and there are still times when i ca n't stand it . i just go to pieces . 
jackie , would you argue with your doctor . 
excuse me ? 
al ? 
you have n't seen <person> , have you ? 
who ’ s she ? 
says who ? 
cupid stupid ! that 's the last time i am getting any more fruit off you <person> . call that fresh ? there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit . you should open a butcher 's , not a grocer 's . 
he said you told him . it 'd be safer with you . 
my father says the day you 're born you start from scratch , no breaks and no excuses , and you got to pull yourself up on your own . 
see . i told you there 'd be a shaft . 
how long have you had it ? 
then do n't . 
for <number> week ! 
were you working here at about <number> o'clock ? 
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west . <person> was he supposed to say no to that ? 
you 're delusional . maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood . and the severed arm ... well i do n't see it and ... maybe this is all in your head . 
then you have to trace it . <person> , people here look at me as a reliable man . i ca n't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man . but you know all that ; there 's nothing you can learn from me . you should n't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner . 
what kind of medication are you on right now , <person> that 's -- 
wait ! did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant ... you had it , threw it out and you 're gon na go back and dance all night ! 
way to go , <person> . if you will it , it is no dream . 
but you stuck it out , anyway , all that time . 
what things do you think you 've done ? 
you the only cat do n't come on with that `` whatcha know , daddy '' jive ; and you do n't cuss none . 
i 'll have to talk to the driver . 
i took <number> thousand out of the savings account . that was what i had in the bank when we got married . 
did n't you call ? 
remember the maine ... 
it got some miles on it , but my boys say she run good . got fresh <number> 's on her . ai n't my doin ' . that 's just how it came to me . do n't worry . nobody gon na come lookin ' for it . i got the pinks ... got no problem . ai n't gon na have my girl ridin ' no bus . 
wrong ... ? science is not magic . 
shut up . i like the kid . remember the night he took <person> at st. nick 's , <person> . we won a bundle . real tough . a big try . 
i just told you . 
where 'd you get it ? 
but ... but ... .but ... . you 're < u > right < /u > . i used it . to < u > bargain < /u > . for her < u > sympathy < /u > ... i < u > used < /u > it -- to `` whore myself out '' -- 
no , you do n't need all that starch . you 're getting too fat . 
and we 'll digest our food better . 
why <person> , you big softie ... 
what 's going on ? 
you did n't ? 
sometimes you ca n't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it 's better to ask someone who has experience.. 
do n't talk about my wife . 
neither do i . 
what do you mean -- not normal ? 
hiya , fellow ... what were they ? 
<person> <person> , i -- 
we want <person> <person> 's sketchbook , what do they call it , the codex . 
where are the kids ? 
there you are . <person> 's tomb . i hope you 're not disappointed . 
there 's no reason to say that . everyone knows you 're going to be well . i had <person> groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light . 
it 's only two-thirty . what , are you tired ? 
shave ? at a time like this ? those guys got machine guns - they 're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave ? 
go to impulse . where 's the borg ship ? 
how did - it 's nothing . a scratch . 
i do n't want you to let go . 
hey , shut up will ya ? 
daddy , she 's younger than me . 
telegrams . 
how observant you are . as a matter of fact , i wanted to give you a word of advice . 
and you , dr. cappucino , you 're lucky i do n't hit women , assuming you are a woman . i 'm not taking anything for granted anymore . 
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home . 
i thought you were sixteen . 
fuck you . 
dad ? 
<person> o'connor called . there 's a meeting with the revlon people in the board room and you 're fifteen minutes late . 
oh mom , you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse . was n't it pretty ? 
we did n't even really have it . i happen to know for a fact that the only <person> <person> single we have is `` do n't <person> <person> . '' i was just goofing on the straight , and it never cost you a penny . 
comrades , why should we lie to each other ? it 's wonderful . 
i 'm not going to curse . 
you finding lots of cactus and shit ? 
hello ? 
<number> , that 's horrible , honey . i sold the pee-wee herman doll ! ! 
i ca n't tell you much about it , except that none of you show any symptoms . 
let me get on your shoulders . 
you 're looking a wee bit green , <person> . 
how come every word you say is either `` cocksucker , '' or `` shitballs , '' or `` fuck ? '' 
i know better than you do . love wants a more substantial fare , and if it is stubbornly withheld , it withers away . 
no . 
she grew up . 
what ? ! what do you mean , i do n't understand . 
whatcha watchin ' there ? 
hello ? 
is n't there an easier way ? 
what are you talking about ? she 's a nice girl . 
agnes ... 
i do n't know , maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has <number> kids and a labrador . 
apple core ? 
i 'm not interested in a woman who 's interested in that boy . 
not what you 'd call rich . makes about <number> thousand a year . 
mother ? 
how many do you see ? 
i 'm certain . he was the biggest defense lawyer around . <person> , actually . 
bianca , i need to talk to you -- i need to tell you -- 
it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose . 
really ? 
wednesday , thursday , friday . 
totally ! 
i guess i wanted to . 
do you sing and dance ? 
what ? 
<person> possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known . 
so we did that crackerbox ... to cover for you . 
why ? 
lovely story . 
i have a tiny apartment . 
first squad up , on line . <person> , get yours in a cordon . watch the rear . 
in here . 
would it have helped if i 'd knocked him down ? 
no , but at least i wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that `` <number> for <number> '' song of yours . you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape . 
you 've come to me . i wanted to believe you would <number> day . 
please ! 
no nothing . 
you ? 
you go home . i 'm takin ' your car and goin ' back to the crime scene .

awesome sleet and rain . 
you 're finished , <person> . you know that , do n't you ? i 've bloody finished you . 
you 're shittin ' me . 
where were you last night ? 
-- <person> is weak . 
she looks tired . 
same thing that happened to you -- i stopped poutin ' there on the sidelines . got in . <person> on the team . i joined the working week , you slick fucking asshole , so why do n't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy , <person> . 
wake up , <person> ! we just watched <person> 's mom torch our fuckin ' kiss tickets ! not reo speedwagon ! not <person> ! not the bay city rollers ! kiss ! if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom , i 'd sure like to hear it ! 
there are more this year than last . 
well we 're off and running . <person> acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental . 
wait . the bozeman , why did it change course ? 
where 'd this gargoyle come from anyway ? 
i say we make him pay first . after that you can do whatever you want to him . 
goddamnit ! goddamnit ! 
no . i should go . 
it 's good to see you . 
jump , <person> ! it 's too late ! 
cobb , i want you to meet <person> . he 's a friend of mine . this is <person> <person> . 
<person> , i 'm concerned . 
are you planning to be home soon ? la , i mean . 
she took them kids with her ? 
i thought you might have . 
you 're kidding ! 
... it is n't there . yes . 
you mean tow her back ? that 's a thirty <number> ton ship you 're talking about . 
so you know what she does ? she 's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine 's bed . 
it 's in my family , you know . my grandmother died in an institution ... 
you know that circulation is down for <number> months in a row . 
i know . 
fuck you . go then . i 'm taking the car . 
general washington , is there actually going to be a compromise , i mean , a 'deal ' with england ? 
relax , kid . it 's only me and my big mouth ... 
yeah ? 
you gave me the bad dreams . you left me behind ... 
you ca n't take that desk out . it 's crawling with cops outside . 
no , please . 
not <person> . 
that 's abnormal . 
yeah , you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you , you 'd probably kill it . 
ahh , i hate this town ! places like this just make you small ... i should have never come back here after college . 
`` routine , '' my ass ! ai n't nothin ' `` routine '' about no physical check- up <number> feet down ... especially when we 're getting picked up the next day ! 
that 's long enough to get out of town . 
according to this tag . 
who 's white ... ? 
yes , my dear ? 
sound like ol ' <person> 's more'n just a little confused , peanut ... too bad he could n't visit that ol ' <person> of oz and get some good advice . 
it means who 's side are you on ? 
yes indeed . you almost got yourself killed last night . 
because if he is a missing link , it means the sacred scrolls are n't worth their parchment . 
this is <person> . we call him the walker . 
you do n't understand . i want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , do n't care where or how you get it , just get it ... my wife tells me you put a move on darien . here 's some inside info for you . that <person> <person> guy she 's going with 's got big bucks but he 's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so do n't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i 've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . '' i like you sport , i ever tell you that ... <person> , call me <person> from now on . 
talk to me . 
no ... 
huh ? 
i did n't say that . i never said -- 
what ? 
do you think i should tell my dad about <person> <person> ? 
what ? 
yeah , sure . you got change ? 
and <person> ? 
but my name 's not ... 
so i understand you correctly . if the missiles in cuba were dismantled , returned to the soviet union , and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them , the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade <person> ?

the point is there 's a certain art to the process . the point is not merely to provide , and let me point out , these fish are not as dumb as you might think . 
could i lie to you and still see your beauty ? 
let 's send his cut back -- just keep going . 
mmmmmmmph ?

yeh , he knows that . 
daddy , <person> , i ca n't .

you lasted <number> years , as orderly , in dr. lechter 's prison ward .

you get him ? 
cool ! 
no , i am appalled that i have a reporter in there , undercover , for almost <number> weeks now- i had to read about this in the tribune . 
forget <person> . you should be glad <person> got you driving for me . 
is this what you want ? you ask me for this after all i 've told you ? 
can i get you anything ? 
what cold ? and after the show , we could go out on the town -- i 've been taking from <person> <person> . 
waddaya getting so sore about ? 
jesus . do n't ask questions like that up in the wine country . they 'll think you 're a moron . 
yes . 
what 's the matter with you ? 
you 're happy for me and <person> . 
i 'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in london . 
no . i only led her into believing i believed she was ... <person> , it 's really very complicated . 
there were treating me like a headcase . 
and give a deposition to the judge . 
who is lamagra ? 
so ... we understand each other judge ? 
where were you , <person> ? 
no . you are a guest now . you go in the living room . 
mom ... i mean , it 's amusing to imagine such a thing , but ... how many of those pills have you been taking ? 
i 'm sorry , <person> . 
monthly ! god , how shallow do you think <person> is ? why do i waste my time telling you this stuff ? 
i know what 's on my birth certificate . you heard from daddy ? 
right . friday night is yankee night . where 're you from ? 
i thought half of it was your brother 's ? 
holy ... 
i 'm not sure what -- 
you 're welcome . 
that was so demeaning ... 
what ? no you 're not.. 
how are you ? 
you 're not tellin ' me that you 're sweet on him ? 
you 're right , <person> . <person> ... <person> approaches <person> . 
loyal , cooperative , resourceful c. c. baxter . 
see how you 've upset him . he was so merry and hale before you came home . 
i want a hot , young white director . maybe the kid , that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy <person> video . 
helen ? it 's <person> . is it safe to talk ? 
liar . did you come from the city on the left , or the city on the right ? 
god -- could have killed me -- bad girl , <person> ! how did you know to do that ? 
me ! no . of course not . 
pheasant . 
what are we going to do with him ? we ca n't dump him in the street . 
hello ? 
i thought your parents were in italy . 
then just give me <number> of your explanations that all <number> of us 'll buy . 
then what the hell are we doing here ? 
they 're <person> 's . 
and how come you 're up so early ? 
but if you 're <number> of the misfits ... that 's where i come in . 
you know what i mean ? like the tip o'your nose , and if i stroke your teeth or your kneecaps ... you get excited . 
you learn to sort of block it out , you know , like cops fence off a crime scene . but then something good will happen and everything will just glow . 
did he ever get rough with you ? 
let 's talk about <person> . 
first let 's see what happens if we play it cool . 
cut the shit , flynne . 
who are all these ? 
no , though the mere thought makes my mouth water . 
i can explain that , <person> . when <person> told me she wanted to interview <person> <person> i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself . 
you talked about it ? 
our guest tonight is the extraordinary , talented performer , mantan . thanks for coming in . 
you think he killed <person> ? 
i 'm a solid man . 
where did you get this ? 
i 'm kinda beat . you can stay in my mom 's room if you want . 
maybe i can do something right . 
why did n't you ask him ? sol knows you ! 
what did you do ? 
we 'll forget it right now . finish your drink . 
you know <person> 's looking for you , <person> ? 
virginia , you 're a lucky little girl . your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest . would you like to be in a beauty contest ? 
well of all- 
louise , do you think we should change cars , get another car ? 
i do n't blame him . what should i do with the ice ? 
failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells ... not a damn thing they can do about it . oh , they can make me comfortable , prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions ... and what makes my blood boil , what little i have left , that is , <person> <person> - is that it 's generally a young person 's disease ... here i am , getting on in years and about to die of a young person 's disease ... 
good . security 's been our biggest worry . now that you 're here we can shut this thing down tight . 
[ what money ? ] 
you did ? 
reducing ? 
still here ... thinking ... you mean <person> , the country ? 
thank you , ma'am . 
first , we may as well decide on gender . have you given it any thought ? 
i , that what all that nonsense was about this morning ? you 're worried about my business ? 
well you did n't have to blow us both out of the water . <person> <person> , just because she found out about you , why 'd you have to take me down with you ? 
blame the victim . 
you 're just reading me . 
his teacher brought him in to see me . said he 'd been acting up in class . creating a disturbance . i could n't get a thing out of him . 
did you talk to him ? 
with mrs. teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control -- 
so , it will just take you a little longer to get over it . 
i -- 
i 'm going to need an operation . maybe a couple of them . they have to wait for it it to heal first . then they break it again . 
yes . 
you 're leaving it out . finish your swing . you 're going to like this <number> -- she 's half asian , half american . 
what right you got to be talkin ' marriage to any decent woman ... 
a videotape . 
i do n't want anything . why are you so suspicious ? 
he needs professional help . i think we should take him to a psychiatrist . 
no . people never run away from anything . the rain did n't last very long . you know what i think ? i think we 're all in our private traps , clamped in them , and none of us can ever climb out . we scratch and claw ... but only at the air , only at each other , and for all of it , we never budge an inch . 
i 'm flattered . and congratulations to you , of course . 
i 'm investigating the death of fredrica bimmel . who are you , please ? 
i 'm really the only <number> qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i 'd prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i 'm not stupid . 
i know your face . you 're <person> <person> . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big . 
come sir galahad , quickly ! 
you 've said a lot of things about the president in the last few months . 
detective - can you tell us what happened here ? 
he was jumpy . he had n't touched a thing . in the old days , <person> would have ordered doubles and eaten it all . on the surface , of course , everything was supposed to be fine . we were supposed to be discussing my case , just like we always would , but i had a feeling <person> was trying to sense whether i was going to rat him out to save my neck . 
equipoise ! equipoise ! what did i tell you , <person> ? 
why , sure , <person> ... there 's just the <number> thing we 're after ... finding <person> and <person> ... 
yeah . 
probably a little too long . 
now i am truly embarrassed . forgive me . i should not have asked such a stupid question . i know you are a very important man and ... 
what the hell you doin ' ? 
i came to kill her . 
yeah , i did , you condescending fuck , but i miss <person> coming out at the end . is n't your enjoyment impaired ? 
it was warmer than i thought it would be , and the skin was softer than it looked . it 's weird . thinking about it now , the organ itself seemed like a separate thing , a separate entity to me . i mean , after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it , i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it . i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me . 
that is so sad -- 
i want you on call here . 
i do n't know . <person> on you man . <person> <person> . 
it 's just that when i 'm in this genre , i tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ... 
here , you see ? even the south african papers apologize -- `` a monstrous attack . '' 
no way ! you 're kiddin ' ! 
even <person> <person> ? ! 
the fact that you have n't said , `` hold it '' means i have n't done it right ... is that correct ? i have n't done it right ? 
good evening , <person> <person> . 
no . but <number> assumes obligations . my wife 's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father 's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it , i 'd come back here . i 've always liked it here . 
now , <person> -- 
i think you have forgotten ... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love , who 'll love you -- the chances are ... always miniscule . look at me -- not counting the american -- i 've only loved <number> girls in my whole life , both total disasters . 
are you going to the party tonight ? 
i 'm sure you mean that to be comforting , but- 
it 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct . 
where are you staying ? 
may i operate your telephonic apparatus ? 
could be hers . <person> match . could be a lot of other people 's too ... 
i would n't go in there if i were you . it 's best to leave him alone when he 's like this . 
what -- 
jesus ! i do n't < u > believe < /u > this ! 
i 'm here . so is <person> and <person> <person> . we understand you 're using the full allocation for this buy ? 
good-night , <person> . 
that 's what he 's been doing since last heard from . 
<person> was anybody like you ... 
gim me the gun . 
yeah , and you should 've seen how terrified she was that he 'd find out . he beats her . 
xxxxxx 
do n't be insane , stop ! full stop ! 
casualties ? 
got ta keep an eye on her , that 's all . 
you consider your life easy . 
maybe because you 're shot in the leg . 
no , i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge . 
he could always make me laugh . 
i just retired . 
maybe it 's for the best…i mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrong…people who are bad should be killed . do n't you think so ? 
i 'm a private detective . i was hired to follow somebody for a few days . a guy called <person> . insurance fraud . 
yeah . 
they could put you back in the tube.. 
oh , how sweet ! you made friends with a nerdy girl . 
what ? 
well , are n't you going to invite me ? 
but -- 
things have been going pretty well between us , have n't they ? 
yes . 
and who was the enemy ? 
the state has some reason to be interested in this man 's proposition , your eminence ... 
he 's not dead . it 's a heroin overdose . break out the narcon . 
i might . 
mookie ? 
about that roadhouse - 
<number> miles . 
then it 's not an accident that they found us . 
listen , they only respond to vibration , right ? could n't we ... distract them somehow ? 
according to that book , once this creature has been reborn , his curse will spread , and as he grows in strength , so will his curse grow , infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed . 
say that again . 
what the hell is that ? 
why did n't you tell me ? 
you are responsible ... what has happened ? 
laura , you have to deal with all of this . 
i saw everything . 
i have something to tell you guys . not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire ... but now i 'm convinced my mother 's < u > dating < /u > <number> ! 
okay . 
but it 's over . <person> 's baby was the key . you saw her die and everything , right ? 
<person> swayzak ! how ya doin ' ? 
oh , cut the crap ! 
worthingsly ... worthington -- no one ever died on me before . 
i 'm on vacation . on my way back to school . 
what do you want me to do ? 
you were looking at it in the catalog . do n't know where you can wear it ... 
what do you guys want ? 
let go of my arm ... 
it 's gon na be fine , <person> . you 're gon na do great . 
yeah ? 
cut some kind of a deal . i heard that 's what <person> 's doing ... 
courtney , you 're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash . new york magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish . '' you 'll love it . and then ... the red snapper with violets and pine nuts . i think that 'll follow nicely . 
i do n't appreciate being cooked like a french fry ! 
<number> over <number> and falling ... . 
are you australian ? 
we can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system . 
yeah , i hate to go alone . you know , i like to talk film ; discuss the critique . d'you wan na see a film with me ? i got passes to the crest . it 's <person> . 
<person> , look at the new poopies . 
what ? 
i know . but then i reconsidered . 'cause i figured out what i really wan na do with my life , what i want to do for a living is i wan na be with your daughter . i 'm good at it . 
yes . 
<number> years . the rep is known around philly , an ' a good rep ca n't be bought , but i do n't have to tell you that . 
government work . had my own think tank . <person> tired of thinking-wanted some action . seen plenty of it too . so will you if you stick around . 
what the hell are you doing here ? 
<person> , if you 'd see these clowns leave , you 'd never believe they 'd come back with anything . but they got him ! 
sara ... ? 
my flesh and blood ! 
ale . i do n't mind . 
... maybe <number> hours . 
i 've got to write some of this down . 
what 's that ? 
i did n't . 
what about <person> <person> ? 
marcus -- i 've seen this window before . 
all i ate was fish . that 's solid protein . 
he 's good people , <person> <person> . i swear . 
i have not , but i very much want to . what do you know about the trouble in devil 's <person> ? 
they 're watching the hollis place . i ca n't get through . 
i 've got more than a right as far as you 're concerned , susan . 
to talk ? well , ok , that might be good . 
i ca n't dance fast . 
the name 's <person> . this here 's <person> <person> . 
what time was it ? 
tails tonight , sir ? 
i 've made so many mistakes , <person> . we all put off the very last duties of our lives because we 're afraid of admitting when our lives are over . 
a hundred bucks ? that 's ridiculous . 
you 're nuts . 
not officially . <person> and <person> <person> were pinned at birth . but i was crazy about her . and for about <number> months , i managed to catch her during her `` exploring '' stage . 
no what ? 
no ! i love sex with girls . 
you will go out there . 
-- anything , sweetheart , you need only speak -- 
migrants ? 
i , um , and may ... maybe they 're in ... they 're in ... you should , <person> , if we 're ins ... 
k-k-kill somebody ? 
... and he called the reporters -- 
have you been hurt ? 
what the hell are you doing ? 
what 're you talking about ? we have that . 
i told you ... the rabble , it ’ s me ... huh ... it ’ s sad . 
yes . i think you probably can . we 'd need to talk about your fee . 
you <person> ? 
<person> . 
i already told you , i parked it for <number> minutes and i locked it with the club -- 
but , here 's the thing . he 'll only talk to you . he does n't want you to ask him anything . and you should n't stare at him . 
the baseball is mine . 
on your pillow . 
`` p '' as in ... 
can i ask you a personal question ? 
yeah . and i thought everyone liked <person> . 
do you make the <number> <person> for the nite owl killings ? 
<number> seventy-nine . 
there are no stories anymore . 
how are you , <person> ? 
i do n't give a shit . this one 's prime for decryonization . we 're brining her back . 
yes , <person> . and now <person> will sleep . it is not long 'till the train . 
<person> ? 
what ? 
the perdido thing ? 
yes , <person> ... 
jesus , that 's my neighbor . <person> . 
mordant , go with them and report back to me ! 
i think so too . 
ben , can i say something to you ? 
call <person> on the horn . see where he is . what he wants us to do . i 'll head over to the school . 
what are you talking about ? 
such as ? 
we 're already getting complaints about frivolous search . 
are you a writer too ? 
basically . 
of course there were n't . 'cause they disappeared . and yet the commission found you , dean . 
standing guard over the old castle , are you ? 
whenever your 're ready , captain . 
please , you 're just as ambitious as i am , more -- 
flight is a scientific impossibility . 
i dunno . <number> ? 
well , it 's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing . 
general grey , co-ordinate with <person> <person> . tell them they have twenty <number> minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can . 
i 'm gon na be putting makeup on some of these people very soon . 
anything today ? 
<person> ? 
what does that mean ? 
not even behind your back ? 
i know , i know , and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher . 
chill , i 'm the brains behind this outfit . 
answer me somethin ' . what happened at the copa with <person> when i was out of town ? 
this is how i met -- 
hey , are you awake ? 
what have i been doing ? different things , different jobs , here and there . nothing that interesting . 
you mean like going to the pictures ? 
not very long . there have been a couple of bids already . 
why ? 
<number> hundred . 
i do n't feel so well . have you seen telly anywhere ? 
nine bodies in roswell , now this -- it 's getting a little hairy , huh ? 
you 're certain ? 
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm , major . 
do i not please you , <person> ? 
look , it smells good . i 'm sure it 's delicious but i do n't know why we ca n't see yoda now . 
why should i ? we 're happy , are n't we , darling ? 
... oh , come on ! you think the same thing ! 
hi . 
come on , i live with the janitor . i have a key to every room in the school . 
what do you want ? 
where ? 
you know , you 're pushy , fella ... 
by reading my thoughts ? 
you considered becoming a prostitute ? 
i can see you feel pretty strongly about it . 
they , uh , they got to my witness . 
did you see an animal of any kind ? did you see a bird ? 
he was there with someone . so i suppose she must have dragged him -- that 's not fair . i 'm going back to mongi . i think <person> 's coming home . i 'm going to go home . 
now . where is d'artagnan ? 
i ca n't sleep . 
okay <person> <person> i 've got <number> for you . what 's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen ? 
in fact , would it be safe to say , based on your general knowledge of this character , that he is already in the building ? 
need some help ? 
what about my orange juice ? 
i do n't know <person> any more than he knows me . 
do n't you throw up on boat ? 
yeah , she looks all right from here . 
uh-huh , i was tryin ' to think of somethin ' to say to you , then i thought , she does n't want me bothering her . 
do you know how many different men i 've had sex with ? 
i do n't see any injury to your neck , <person> <person> . 
i 'll pass the word on , then . 
sure . <number> years ago , but he was a good thief <person> , the cops would n't let him go legit . 
<number> thousand . 
something wrong , man ? you look a little whiter than usual . 
anyway , down here , take a look ... 
what ? 
then you know that if i give you a little advice , it 'll be good advice . 
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship 's money and pearls . 
last transmission said ten juve- niles . 
in a holding cell . 
<person> <number> , does that glare bother you ? 
what ! ? 
that— —word again ! why do you keep saying conscience , conscience ... . 
well , as my mother says at sunday dinner , `` come and get it , '' bitch ! 
i feel very emotional right now . a bit out of control . 
no . but he needs treatment . 
heavy graphical background , doing design-interface for skywire apps . you 'll be working with her . 
i ca n't believe that . 
huh . you know , <person> , watching you just now with the deutsches bank , <number> would think you 'd been doing this all your life . 
the skin flake was found in michael 's restaurant . the employees are all accounted for . 
cuuuute ! 
actually , i do n't think so . 
hello , <person> . enjoy your meeting ? 
it was n't like that . 
eating ? 
that 's it ? that 's all you have to say ? 
in your money , perhaps $ <number> . 
i ca n't do that ? 
you 're welcome . i was the one who cried . 
what kept you ? 
why did you do that ? did n't you have any idea how hard it was for me , to get that far ? i worshipped you . you inspired me . i thought you could understand me the way you understood the others . i knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers ; they fascinated you . 
buckaroo -- ! <person> -- 
you can tell me . 
he looks like a terrific kid . 
she 's calling the shots now . 
'cause i 'm not calling out from the phone company anymore -- -- i think the place is bugged . 
you comin ' ? 
<person> ? 
so ... how many movies you been in ? 
if you want that baseball jacket for your birthday , <person> , learn to cough a little more realistically . 
better late than never . 
i 'm not asking you to believe me . you 'll see for yourself ... and so will your crew . you 're all coming with me . 
kevin ! you seen <person> lately ? 
you 're on your own , understand ? 
what happened in those <number> minutes ... ? 
my god , an actual operating 8-track . 
never better . 
when you 're annoying as hell , i care a lot . 
do n't bother . 
... .it 's alright ... . 
here ... to help pay <person> 's ransom . all the captains gave what they could , as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved ... 
he got me through <person> and a lot of other stuff . i owe him . 
there is more here than meets the eye is n't there ? lots of dirty little secrets . 
oh , the uncle is missing . 
if you say a word in english , <person> , my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat . <person> to screw you over like this , but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you , and that 's a price i 'm not willing to pay . 
meaning ? 
huh ? 
people , people -- wait , wait a minute , here . uh , while we have n't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- iowa , <person> , north dakota ... 
where ? 
our e.p.s . was <number> fifty last quarter . we 're up <number> cents per share . 
i did n't say that , j.j . 
there goes your ride . 
no , i know i do n't want it cleaned . get out of here . 
color ? 
why ? why do you have to go ? 
no , i do n't . he happens to deserve the credit . he 's right here . 
yeah , but it does n't take <person> <person> just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not . 
i 'd kill him . <person> and that redfield woman . together . <person> <number> then the other . and then i 'd laugh . 
let him have it . you 're winning anyway . it does n't make any difference . 
would you please repeat the destination ? 
what 'd you say your name was ? 
the royal ... studs ? 
oh , it 's too good . we got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers . 
that 's not the point . <person> <person> has the world by the tit because of this studio , and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you . no . no , that young lady has a contract , and she 's going to honor it . 
we 're preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking . 
do n't give me that preoccupied scientist crap . i 'm trying to get ready for ... . 
he needed money ? for the operation for you ? 
uh , right ... and that was it . that 's when we decided to start our own business . no more shithead bosses . 
stop . <person> thought i was good too -- he could n't help . my agent has a hot prospect -- the number <number> station in portland . the general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks . personally , i think he should aim higher . 
i hope you understand . 
rheya . not here . 
not exactly . 
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's just a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway . 
al , are you doing anything in there ? 
look , my wife is understandably -- 
thirty per cent . in the first year your share would be <number> <number> dollars ; then it would go up . 
me ? the king of coitus ? 
i doubt it . it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding . i know your feelings . you 'd best forget them . it 's for your own good . there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan . it 's the heart of the sith . the bogan force is the most heavy there . 
it was n't planned or premeditated . i swear . things happened beyond my control . i understood ; i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense . 
then have a donut -- 
what do you think i 'm doing ? i 'm on my way to the school like you wanted . 
take her to my house . my dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone . do you have anything to put around her ? 
there 's nothing wrong with me , brother . that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do . 
what i need are some answers . 
what i 'd like to do , is to make an appointment for you at the hospital . i 'd like to have them run some tests . 
i always hoped i would hit <number> meters . 
no , <person> . that 's not true . it ca n't be true . 
rules are rules . 
look ! this is a good <number> ! 
i almost did n't make it to the bathroom , <person> . i almost lost control right in front of everybody . 
did not . 
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this . and no one had a machine like this . 
what do you do anyway ? 
it was weird ...

i believe he earned it for saving a man 's life in saudi arabia . he wanted you to have it . he was very clear on that point . 
enough 's enough . how could anybody in their right mind ... then again , you never were in your right mind . 
so the way you see it , <number> crack heads burned themselves up ?

captain , if they fire at us with our shields down -- 
nothing . it 's not funny . 
well , then -- this is too much for *my* lame brain . i 'm calling <person> <person> . 
<person> . 
right , of course , the company ... but you see , i 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- 
i said i had an idea , that 's all . 
he 's not in , <person> ? 
that her ? 
i do n't think this aversion therapy is really necessary , doctor . i understand the problem .

then it was over the water department . 
do you have family here ? 
not disintegrating , <person> -- digitizing . while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object , the computer maps out a holographic model of it . the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam . then the computer reads the model back out , the molecules go back into place , and ... voila . 
besides , how are we gon na sell something we do n't have ? 
jeanne ... i believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once ? do n't go ... even if you do n't want to marry me .

oh , all the great writers -- shakespeare , <person> <person> , <person> <person> ... those people . each is bound in genuine premium leather with <number> carat gold accents . it 's a magnificent set -- and only $ <number> per volume . <person> away you get <person> <person> for just $ <number> .

not that i 'm glad you were sick , but i had a chance to do some thinking last night . 
uh , we can stop somewhere if you and adele have n't had time for breakfast , early . 
they did n't fire her ? 
people think it 's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite , which is not to be ignored , but what they forget - <person> is shooting up for the pleasure of it . otherwise we would n't do it . after all , we 're not fucking stupid . at least , we 're not that fucking stupid . take the best orgasm you ever had , multiply it by a thousand and you 're still nowhere near it . when you 're on junk you have only <number> worry : scoring . when you 're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite . got no money : ca n't get pished . got money : drinking too much . ca n't get a bird : no chance of a ride . got a bird : too much hassle . you have to worry about bills , about food , about some football team that never fucking wins , about human relationships and all the things that really do n't matter when you 've got a sincere and truthful junk habit . 
that 's disgusting . 
you think so ! ? i 've been working out a lot since the baby . and i 've been working . and that takes it 's toll , you know .

you got somethin ' against the cap'n ? 
drinking alone . 
what 's this ? a cockaroach ? 
but i never know when you 're working and when you 're not working !

it 's nice to meet you . my husband has told me a lot about you ... except your first name . 
as i said , in every way . <person> and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you <number> .

when you get going on those broads , think of me ! 
too bad . he says i 'm a communist . 
you joke about it , <person> , but we are in a state of crisis . the lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy -- to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong , between this <number> and that <number> -- your daddy understood that . he was like the whatchacallit -- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here . he understood how most people do n't want their sugar and salt in the same jar . 
sure . it 's a wind-up ... thing . 
i got it figured out ... he 's got this thing with bathrooms . if he makes it through customs , he 'll be heading for the john . 
cain -- like the bible guy ? 
come on , mom . do n't fall asleep ...

lemon ? 
but we 'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good . 
no <number> knew what to do . finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with <person> illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with <person> 's syndrome . do you know of it , captain ?

there were no pg 's . so i just gave them money to play games . 
he was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning . he said he had never seen any like them .

to risk <number> 's life against such people is an imposition . 
bullet resistant ? whatever happened to bullet proof ? 
ah , yes ... the code . it 's a riddle , actually . some fancy of <number> 's . unfortunately , you 'll have to find out for yourself . i can no more know that code than i can shut down my own hard wired defences . now , our time is running short ... and you have n't even touched your drink . 
i 'm proud of you . 
have i flipped out ? ... is any of this real ? 
who else ? i 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of rome ! or for the glory of you !

well sure , look at it ! young trophy wife , i mean , in the parlance of our times , owes money all over town , including to known pornographers -- and that 's cool , that 's cool -- but i 'm saying , she needs money , and of course they 're gon na say they did n't get it 'cause she wants more , man , she 's got ta feed the monkey , i mean -- has n't that ever occurred to you ... ? sir ? 
and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages ?

that woman could be in any <number> of <number> states . <number> big states where the deer and the antelope play , wesley ! we 're not in rhode island !

no . 
how will they come at you ? 
... sorry , <person> . i 'm sorry this happened to you . 
i guess i 'll try to back it out on the rim ... at least to the main road . 
you want something ? 
it 's okay . 
i haven ’ t been able to recall a single moment of that day ... until now . 
of course i do . where are you ? 
[ who 's he ? ] 
do i know you ? 
it 's hard to believe you 're going to be eighteen . want an eskimo pie ? or a creamsicle ? i 'd come home from the store and there 's little you running up to me . i 'd give you a dime and you 'd promise never to grow up . 
i 'd really like to see <person> <person> . 
you mean just leave the hotel ? 
hey , c'mon , country boys , let 's all line up and hear the expert .

what the fuck is <person> doing with that cop ? he loves them . 
she wants it to come .

you 're a starfleet officer and you have a duty to- 
reggie -- please believe me !

but there may be a few around somewhere . 
so , if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves , what do you want with drugs ? you like seeing lots of pretty colors when you 're tearing people 's throats out ?

so what did you think ? 
doc ! how the hell are you ?

it must 've happened right after we left . 
<person> , i think you could get with the program a little . the police are here now . it 's their problem . tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt . hey , i 'm putting my life on the line for you buddy ... 
`` d.w.r . '' that case you worked on ... the guy who threatened to kill wynant ... what what was his name ? 
oh , hey ... 
what about <person> ? what have you done to nanook ? ! what have you done to my dog , you asshole ? ! 
i do n't think you are sufficiently in awe of it . get the castor oil . 
who 's <person> <person> ? 
i used to sing with male bands . but i ca n't afford it any more . 
no , just drunk ... but that 's ok. where 's your car ? 
i did . but princess margaret was a doll . we 're all equals in her eyes . as commoners , i presume . 
<number> , <person> ! 
<number> me for askin ' , son , and i do n't mean to belabor the obvious , but why is it that you 've got your head so far up your own ass ? 
and what is ... this frozen moment ?

it 's not that i do n't like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and ... i just keep myself opening up . crowning . and i want you keeping up with me here . 
is it worth anything ? 
it will end tonight . 
yes . 
come on -- i 've got another idea . 
why was <person> assigned ? 
it ai n't done , if that 's what you mean . 
what do you do on the other days ? 
i know . i feel the same thing . but we 're between a rock and a hard place . we ca n't keep them without risking their lives and we ca n't let them go without a taking the same chance . 
we 're on course , major . <person> fixed our position on that river back there . 
here 's the layout of the laundry room . 
and now ... 
no .

it sounded like it came from the courtyard .

-- alleged crime -- 
well , it 's a big day . wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff . any thoughts ? last minute refine- ments or variations ? 
come on , try it . ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella 's flappin ' in the breeze . ... everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we 're bare assed in the middle of it . come on ! 
movement ! 
you know <person> . he 'd never say anything . but i can tell . until you came along , <person> was the only family i ever had . without him , i do n't know how i would have survived . he saved my life , <person> . and i 've never told him . 
i 'm very sorry . 
i don ’ t want to be safe !

you 're just doing your job . 
bible says the same thing about killin ' others , too . 
she 's in the green . 
these guys are n't the kind that 'll take an apology . they 're the kind that 'll break my thumbs . 
this girl -- thea —- is not a servant in my household , sir . she is my daughter 's companion . now , sir , if you 'll excuse me , i 'll go have a look at <person> <person> . 
thank you very much . it 's a pleasure . 
unless i make her <number> of us ... 
it 's quite satifactory . 
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place ? children are very impressionable , you know . 
look at me , <person> . on my mother 's soul , on god above , on everything that is holy to me , i did not steal your shoes . 
a murderer ? 
so you can give us away ? 
i told you i do n't know nothin ' and i ai n't saying nothin ' . 
no , i do n't think so . 
this is a mistake . i should n't be here .

like this - like how ? it 's your fault . you 're to blame . i was saving myself . 
no -- you do n't want to be alone at all -- you were in despair before -- if i left you , you 'd feel worse than you did before , you must not be alone -- you must n't cry -- you must forget ... tell me that i can stay with you -- tell me . 
you wan na come ? 
yes , i do . whatever 's out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier . 
she 's a suspect , naturally . but not the only one . 
are you sure this is <person> <person> ? 
where are the stockings he strangled them with ? 
he is the destructor .

you know , did he seem depressed ? do you think he 'll eat the food ? 
please ... .shoot me . 
maybe i 'm not a good man . maybe inside i 'm bad , and i 'll always be bad . 
where does <person> live ? 
do n't be so amazed . it 's a very ordinary matter . i 'm <person> 's physician ... <person> <person> told me you were in town and <person> has sent me to bring you to her . 
what was that ! ? 
you said you could n't remember killing <person> <person> . <person> ? 
hmm ? 
yeah ?

maybe in the next life , the world will not need a <person> <person> . 
how 's it supposed to work <person> ? you and paley celebrate your victory . you get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he 's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me . after that i figure she 'll tell the police that you broke in . that you were crazed because we humiliated you in court ? 
he wanted the pineal gland . 
are you proposing to transfer command to me ? 
my wife . 
uh-oh ... 
yeah . 
the battery 's in , that 's done with . besides , you 'd do the same for m ... 
while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net . 
yeah , right . 
yes , sir . the base commander , general ripper , selected plan-r ? 
please do n't . do n't , <person> . i can understand how you feel . 
i do n't know if you can choose that , <person> . 
no , thank you . yes . i 've seen every performance . 
i started racing after my parents died . there was something about the speed , the danger , that took me out of myself , that made the hurt go away . you would n't understand . 
what ? ! 
what ... ? why ? 
the one he kept in his right hand . yes , you remember . 
you and <person> gon na stay here ? 
i think that 's about the time i fell asleep .

they always seemed ...

craig is <number> syllable 
nah . it 's a scratch .

we ca n't leave him to repeat anything . 
um ... can dad come this time ? 
tim , what are you talking about ? 
childish dreams , captain . lost in the dilithium mines of remus . i 'm what you see now . 
you 're smashed , vanessa . 
i want a martini ! it 's new year 's eve and i want a martini ! 
my father ! he 's not - ? 
quite a while . 
you see , sean ? that 's exactly not the point . no one remembers that . they -- 
i suppose you want a tip ? 
baudmore consultants . 
who 's that ? 
why would you call me from my front porch ? 
what an adorable hat . 
your casino loses money . maybe we can do better . 
ca n't we -- 
well , instead of a haircut , how about a wash ? you know , get all that city grit out of it . 
his legend grows ! it will be worse than before ! 
what ? 
you do n't understand . you do n't realize how important it is . 
well ... we should n't rush into this , right ? let 's talk about it . 
fuck ! 
you had immense plans ... immense plans ... 
dylan . and ... chase . my god , wes , did you know ? 
no ... you ... go ... ahead . 
did you meet the president ? 
<person> 's a perfectly good name , is n't it ? 
i ca n't believe she went out with that monster last night 
sure you did . 
so you never bought any land . 
but that 's silly , child . seeing how you feel , why— 
israel does n't have a king . 
did you enter virginia into a beauty contest ? 
should we get a what ? 
what is it ? 
okay , enough -- now , look , <person> -- this incident aside , i do n't think this is the right place for you . so what i 'm gon na do is make a few calls on your behalf . find you something else , okay ? 
what lesson ? not to expose fraud when i see it ? not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property ? run it the way i said , reilly - `` this afternoon a great man was assassinated - '' 
well , are n't you going to make a deposit ? 
are you closing the case ? 
nowhere in particular . do n't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore ? 
you 're mad . why are you mad ? 
what he does with them - takes privacy ... time , tools ... he 's in his <number> 's or <number> 's - he 's got real physical strength , but combined with an older man 's self-control . he 's cautious , precise , never impulsive ... this wo n't end in suicide , like they often do . 
oh , let <person> wait . 
you 're not married , are you ? 
now , we 're informed that you have a statement you 'd like to read , is that correct ? 
<person> kune do ... now i did some research on that form of fighting , and i found out that <person> <person> <person> was a style developed by <person> <person> . did you know that ? 
did he ? i left school and worked for the labour party . my older brother , <person> , had just been killed in greece , and he 'd been an active member . i hero-worshipped him . he was <number> years old ... it was an exciting time for us , those first couple of years after the war . we thought the country was about to become a true democracy . i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time . they feel betrayed . they want to know what went wrong . 
well , certainly that 's a possibility , <person> -- 
hi ... 
well , except for the <number> girl . 
well , <person> , as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions -- 
of course not . as a matter of fact , it was just the other way around . you see he needs help . 
and you said ... ? 
i wo n't tell you over the phone . i 'm comin ' to n.o . and i 'll tell you then . 
none of that matters now . the people upstairs need us . we have to help . 
hey , <person> , looks like you really stepped in it this time . 
how the hell did you do that ? 
yes . 
maybe . 
remember him ? 
i 'm drinking . 
celebrate ? what for ? 
cream and sugar . 
it 's got to be sent to another town . and if we do n't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off . 
<person> <person> , i 've got good news for you -- 
is this your gun ? 
did you bag any geese on this trip ? 
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face . 
when i came upstairs , you stayed to finish your drink . i told you to turn off the tv when you were through . come to think of it , i also told you you could sleep in the maid 's room . 
who says she does anything for me ? she 's my friend . when my friends get into trouble , i like to help 'em out . 
you 've reached the first containment seal . the engineering decks are on the other side . 
everything else means nothing to me . if i hurt you again , i 'll die . 
hello . thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home . 
thanks . 
so you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed ? 
i 'm going to miss you . 
it was once worn by <person> the sixteenth . they call it <person> <person> de la mer , the -- 
well hello , officer . 
was she ill before that girl came into your household ? 
then the vault , how to get in the vault , that 's stumping me . 
we need to talk . 
how long have you been doing this ? 
funny . <person> seen some track bunnies by now . 
i think of running for help , and falling to my knees in prayer . 
i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man . 
what do you see ? 
i thought we were goin ' into town . 
you did n't let me down . or even <person> . we do n't live or die by what you scribble , <person> . you let <person> <person> down . he liked you . trusted you . and that 's why he 's gone . fired . that guy had a heart as big as the outdoors , and you fucked him . he tried to convince me to fire you too , but that would be too easy . no , you 're under contract and you 're gon na stay that way . anything you write will be the property of <person> <person> . and <person> <person> will not produce anything you write . not until you grow up a little . you ai n't no writer , <person> – you 're a goddamn write-off . 
bam ! that <person> <person> blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if <person> would have really had <number> guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end . 
what 's wrong ? 
boyfriend ? 
data , this is n't the time . 
... we have <number> <number> invested . at this point , we 're up <number> <number> and some change . if it goes to <number> bucks we can clean close to <number> mill . 
i wo n't defend my life to you . 
what ? 
i do n't know -- they 've always been there . 
weaver , they 're career girls . they 're obsessed with digging . no , i 'll probably never meet the girl for me . 
i 'm doing a piece on right-wing groups , post <person> <person> . i hear you 're an important figure in those circles . you have a lot of interesting ideas ... . 
drove into superior ? what for ? 
and the carrying charges ? 
being on the street 's a little different than sitting in an office all day , is n't it ? 
<number> time academy award nominee , <person> <person> . 
you want me to dress like her ? 
ask me the questions , bridgekeeper . i am not afraid . 
what do you think ? 
my mistake - she 's glaring . 
you 'll come back tomorrow and get the rest . just get out of here . 
hello ... . ? 
he 's not a cop killer . 
you never called me back . i left messages . 
yes . 
kitty , i would appreciate ... if you could wait ... 
i wonder what they do in there ? do n't they frighten you ? they all look so ... 
i can help you , man , but you got ta get me out . i got to be on the street . get me outta here . 
what 's she doing here ? 
what 's he running for ? 
lem me guess . some corporate v.p . 's banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder . 
that 's what i call a payday . 
your life has been defined by institutions . the orphanage where you were raised , the fbi academy , the bureau . if the institution is your life , < u > accept < /u > it . ask to be reinstated on the `` drumgo '' task force . play their game . 
i know . 
let 's not close our eyes . there are many good things to see here too . 
i wo n't wait until tuesday . i 'll break your arms right now . 
perhaps your memory plays tricks , mrs. peel . 
you got it all worked out , do n't you ? 
it shall be done , your majesty . 
do you think she is ? 
sal ! <person> ... goddamn it , <person> , do n't you know anything ? 
it 's 12th century . from deauville -- in france . 
and what are they , pray tell ? 
but nothing ever could , ever did , give me a moment 's pause about this marriage ... 
i think -- she 's crazy . 
bye , <person> <person> . what 's with the lie ? 
absolutely . the map is very clear . 
hi , <person> -- 
what ? 
look , we have <number> choices . we can hike back down to the lagoon , where we can sit for <number> days , in the open , next to a heavily used water source while we 're waiting for your boat to arrive , or we can head for the village , where we might find some shelter and we can call for help . 
who are these orphans , anyway ? 
maybe a power interruption crashed the system ... 
who ? 
men are very sensitive , you know . we need to feel loved and desired , too . 
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on ? -- one that she 'd bought herself ? 
let me get a little reaction here . <person> 's elliot ?

yes . 
she like it rough ? you like beatin ' on her ? 
you work there , <person> <person> . 
and <number> other thing . 
i ca n't hold the weight of both of you ! 
i 'm not quite sure how this works . my brother ... 
ca n't you hold it ? 
it is true that your parents were poor . they still are . and they would like to know how you are - and where . they have n't heard from you for <number> years ... 
i 've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper . it was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store . 
she 's dead . 
and when was the last time she put herself out for you ? look , <person> , whatever she says to you now , in the end you 're still a servant . 
the school board does n't pay you ? what kind of deal is that ? 
yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely . 
sqweeep . we innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin -- `` aliens from <person> <number> have hijacked <person> <person> and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop ... ''

another free program off line . what 's his <person> s'posed to do -- ? 
my german 's a little rusty . 
now , they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it , but the judge threw it out ... however , for you , there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order ... 
fair enough . no pressure here , <person> , because i respect you , but let me point out a couple of things . <number> , here you make a difference to <number> hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out . <person> <number> <number> people go to the pictures every week . 
he 's god ! i mean , this man is god ! he 's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment . 
but first we 'd like to find out a few things about you .

it 's the planet that 's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon . 
new hat ? <person> 's up , i see . 
i want to be fair-minded , <person> .

are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing ?

i 'm engaged . i 'm supposed to be married in <number> days . 
i have entrusted you with a great many things . in your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live . i think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded .

fifteen minutes ago , where were those cards ? 
the only other spook i knew was a liar . charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth . he 'd lie about his favorite color . but then i reckon it 's an occupational hazard . all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies .

an angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at quick stop convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around <number> o'clock . division of taxation calls the state board of health , and they send me down here to issue a fine . you say you were working all day , hence the fine is yours . it 's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child .

since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .

now what are we doing ? i do n't get any of this shit ! 
and rome . 
right there , between your eyes -- see ? worry lines . you 're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that . how about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up ? 
that 's what the guy said . 
<person> <person> acted in a cough syrup commercial . he thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic . he said the play sucked big time . 
<person> . <person> --

road 's in ! now , soon as we hit bixby we start making phone calls . we could make some real money off this whole thing , get in < u > <person> < /u > magazine ... 
my momma 's a beautician . guess that 's where i get it from . she would n't hear of my moving in with <person> ... on account of his just getting out of jail and all . ai n't seen her in nearly a year now . i wish she 'd call me , just once . 
but i have to pay the actors and the authors . 
we 're locked into albania . 
you go back , you wo n't be alone . you 'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate . you 're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes , but `` <person> '' will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it 'll be to attend his own funeral . depressing . 
hello , i 'm -- 
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi 's forum sketches . 
why do n't you let me tape you ? 
yes . it is , <person> . yes . it 's a big decision . and it 's a big reward . it 's a big reward . for <number> night 's work . but it 's got to be tonight . 
it 's not easy . none of it is . i have to find some way to get on with my life and i 'm going to try . i finally figured that out . i 'm going to do my best ... . 
extremely unfortunate maneuver .

hi . did n't get a chance to say goodbye . 
i know that . 
oh , yes , you will . you 'll do it to oblige <person> and myself . 
you used to like to touch me -- to make love to me . 
well ... 
if he had his blinkers on -- 
<person> , i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside -— where it matters . i wanted it that day too , but did n't dare tell you . 
well , i tried sneaking in after college , but they found breasts during my physical . 
yo -- i ai n't mad . i 'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an ' <person> knows it . 
do n't look like there 's a right way . 
anything you 've got . 
what 's going on ? `` guilty '' ! what is this ? 
it 's not your fault . 
because ! because i 've always been faithful to god , and i 've followed everything he said ... and i 've done everything he asked me ... 
oh -- he come to an accommodation . <person> does n't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning . 
no , you 're naturally smart . you always think of the funniest things to do . remember when you passed me that postcard during spanish class , and it was addressed like , `` <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> <person> from the blackboard '' ? and it said , `` i 'm having fun in barcelona -- wish you were here '' ? that was hilarious . 
yeah , i 've always been able to make my way in the world . i do n't like having to rely on other people . 
come closer then , <person> , that i might give you proper thanks . 
[ she 's late , mr . <person> . ] 
i have n't been hiding . i 've been in police custody . they 've been trying to flush out <person> 's killer .

<person> savoy . <person> dance ? 
never knew my father . i grew up with my mother . actually , i grew up around my mother . she was great though . i mean , the way she was with her friends ... she was this woman who had so much life in her , she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us . [ <person> ] she died young . 
too late . all the elements are in place . delay the opening and we lose the theater . 
<person> <number> ? 
candle wax . <person> wax . <person> wax ? could be anything . <person> 's waxing his mustache at the beach . gets sand in it . wipes it off with a shoe . <person> scuffs the counter . 
you know , it 's the whip -- the <number> uncle <person> got me from mexico . 
you 're not wearing a belt . 
i think what <person> wants to say is -- 
see you made it . 
who 's going to die ? 
yes ... oh , yes ... 
no , i didn ’ t ... that ’ s great . 
and the other was <person> ? 
no , i 'm on top of it ...

where is she ? 
i know . i kept walkin ' , i headed for your house , only it was n't your house , really . you let me in only you were n't real pleased to see me . you kept askin ' , 'why 'd you come to see me now ? why now ? ' like it 'd been a long time since we 'd seen each other . 
... where ? 
see ? 
see ... now that we know you know , the hard part 's done for us . 
you really want to know ? 
thank you for at least sounding sincere . 
does it happen to all men ? 
who 's in it ? 
the what ? 
why ? 
whatya talking ? i 'm clean as a preacher 's sheets , babe . <person> as a -- 
then will you meet him , as a representative of the committee . 
that , and the sweet smell of <number> <number> <number> bucks . 
geez , he never gets tired does he . 
i want a message sent : no fuckups allowed . 
there are worse things than vampires out there . 
what you did is dead wrong . 
well forgive me if i do n't think of you as the world 's safest bet . 
jesus to <person> and <number> hands around ! <person> , did i ever tell you how i beat dartmouth by intercepting a pass ? 
dano , should n't we stop and help your mother ? 
just tell me where it hurts , baby . 
his head was just ... bitten off . 
you already tried to pull <number> little number on me -- and it did n't work . 
was someone rude to you ? 
pops a couple more potatoes on <person> 's plate . herbert glances at pauline . 
folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons : money . adventure . <person> . those cover most everyone . but frontiers also draw another type of man . <number> with a demon in his gut . he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon , and lay it to rest . 
yeah , it 's pretty amazing how much cash you got ta give to the actual artists who create the music . those ingrates really take a bite . but seriously , when <person> died , you got <person> , crunch , and sutton to help finance a c.d . cleans operation . you got greedy and they tried to get the <number> discs together to threaten you , but ... 
look pretty rough . 
there 's a short letter i left you all , just some ... sentimental nonsense ... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred ... i 'd just as soon you delete it ... 
that 's not it . 
i got your message . way to go !

i 'm filling in . we do n't know if she 's coming back . she might have to get a job closer to home . 
there was a bit of confusion on <number> of my last jobs . 
maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ... 
i could n't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . i 'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive . 
what 's there to think about ? ? that thing back there ... 
nuke wo n't go to bed with you , eh ? 
but it 's all you do . 
this one 's a story , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire .

not english though . you heard the voices right <person> <person> ? 
... there is no longer any margin for inflation , it has gone as far as it can , you 've reached your limits on taxation , dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis , and , from where i see it , <person> president , the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point . we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible . 
i can look and see . 
do i have any other choice ? 
yeah . i met this guy -- <person> , <person> <person> . he said i was . <person> loser . 
danny , what the hell are you trying to do out there ? 
uh , `` no '' ... you 're not fat .

how 's your leg ? i 'll live . where 'd you leave <person> ? 
they want my diary . 
i had to go to work !

`` crewman # <number> '' ... call me guy . 
back ? you 're sending me back ? 
he was not family . <person> is all that matters . do you think if you or i were being dragged from here , any <number> of them would lift a finger to help us ? 
ah ha . you finally want to know about women .

`` it looked extremely rocky for the boston <number> that day . ''

you 're acting kind of ... odd . 
a user ? 
the drugstore 's closed ? what the hell time is it ? 
he 's another ivy leaguer so he 'll probably expect you to be understanding -- might surprise him if you 're not . 
okay . you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures ? well , this is the story of how i got my first camera . as a matter of fact , it 's the only camera i 've ever had . are you following me so far ?

mama , there 's hot meat on the stove ! 
where ?

she lied to me . i mean all my life , she 's telling me <number> story and then ... it turns out to be a completely different story . come to me at some point -- tell me the truth . no . not in my house . the truth is a stranger . and this is why <person> and <person> are the way they are . <person> gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - `` how do they find me '' she says . <person> cheats on you and then blames me for it . i 'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself ... oh , man ... are you all right ? 
my name 's <person> . 
quiet ! shhh ! 
what about the guy on the very bottom ? 
nothing ? 
you 're gon na help us take him .

< u > fuck me < /u > . you said `` clear . '' 
no ! 
<person> is n't going to sit in with us , <person> . he only handles specific areas of the family business . <person> ? 
i love you dad .

you 're kidding -- 
then why are you so upset ? 
<person> starts at <number> . <person> 's tomorrow at noon . 
i received a telegram from <person> goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor . i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse . after the dreadful events of november <number> , the violent attacks on the jews , i stopped using the title . 
it 's not good enough . 
yes , mam ... 
and nobody else can do that ? 
well , thank you mistuh <person> <person> <person> . 
where are we going ? 
she 's working as fast as she can , icarus . it will be ready soon .

he went home to change for the big date . 
that never stopped you before . 
he killed her . i 'm not crazy . he killed her and -- 
naw - i 'm sure the suspect 's not here . 
do you want me to take his leg off ? where 's the fourth ? 
any sign of buckaroo ? 
how is lillian ? i have n't seen her . 
... the feeling of slipping without falling ... the hardest is once you are at the bottom . 
why don ’ t you get my half sister her seventh hole ? 
the sweep is just routine , not even police action . i 'd like to see some sort of ... meaningful evidence ... 
well , he 's got his gun on his hip there , and he looks like a nice enough guy . it 's a real shame . 
dr. <person> ; page <number> , 'contraindications to general anesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to <number> hours prior to induction of general anesthetic . ' does that sound familiar ?

i do n't know , dude . 
and you ca n't count <person> <person> anyway . 
-- you 're a nurse , are n't you ? 
you 're kidding . 
<person> president , it 's an honor . now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here . 
where ? 
he 's at it again . like that night at the emerald . this piece of euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so <person> <person> <person> here has got to step in and pound the fucker 's head into the wall . meantime `` wifey '' recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero 's eye out . it took <number> stitches . 
once you were their freak , now these clowns do your bidding . must feel pretty good . 
why are you here ? ? 
i can take it . 
what 's still there ? 
you can not marry wessex ! 
for a month . 
how long were you in ? 
okay , <person> ! let 's get those all-beef frozen patties ! 
or reactivated the first one . 
well , i 'm working with someone , now , who was the former head of research at brown & <person> , a former corporate officer there . 
right . 
oops ! i dropped it ! 
i 'm staying with the ship . i 'll be all right . now hurry . 
yes , but the rope might be -- 
i thought everything was checked out . 
who 's going to question us ? <person> ? <person> ? 
why , honey -- 
all the better . hey , <person> <person> <person> , next geraldo , buddy boy . ha ha ha . 
but the thumb always works . different ways to do it , though . depends on how you feel . for instance , number <number> is a short , jerky movement— that shows independence . you do n't care if they stop or not . 'cause you got some money in your pocket , see ? 
what is it ? 
what are you on about ? 
but she 's right there ! i must feel her ! 
i would appreciate it . i 've tried everywhere in town , and they 're all full . 
the doctor 's a respected man , a friend of the court -- 
do you ? even assuming you 're able to prevent ambrose selling chimera , you 've now got an additional problem . you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte . if <person> is going to sell chimera now , he 'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss hall 's blood to market . 
i want you to try something with me , okay ? 
i think nothing happens . you 're dead meat . that 's it . 
yes , i believe there wo n't be any more talk of the nlf for some time . 
your friends , did they ask about me ? 
this is a war , <person> . you against him . vengeance time . the city 's just in the way . kill the fucker . you and me . we 'll work things out when the time is right . 
<person> ' on getting married ? 
but look at what 's been done with hearts and kidneys ! 
you 've been in an institution , have n't you , <person> ? a hospital ? 
they just left , sir . 
man to man , <person> <person> , are you working on this case ? 
who else knows about the boy ? 
we think it might . that 's why we brought you here . we 've assembled your team -- they 're waiting for us now . 
does that ever happen ? 
jesus , <person> , that 's ... that 's really lovely . 
it was his idea . 
that 's good , but <person> would never use the word `` myriad . '' 
what are you ? 
i have my family . also our lord jesus christ . 
i did n't tell you everything . 
we 're late . 
you did n't get a deer ? 
oh dear . i 'll never work in this town again ? 
but -- does n't god ordain both pope and king ? 
do you miss cuba , <person> ? 
your forgetting <person> <person> ? 
i tell you this is half sold . 
you did great , except there 's just <number> little thing -- i ca n't work with this paper . it 's corrasable bond , it smudges . maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white , long-grained mimeo . 
this may be hard for you to understand ... but i 'm duty-bound not to interfere with you , or anyone else here ... any more than is absolutely necessary . 
for food and clothes , and all that grows , etc , etc . <person> <person> , thank you . 
make time , okay ? you 're the one who told me to act normal . i 've missed <number> practices already . if i 'm not there for the barber game tomorrow everyone 's gon na talk . 
oh , my god ... <person> , no ! 
<person> 's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres . all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors ... 
what choice did i have -- ? ! 
can you account for his disappearance in any way ? 
yes , he threatened to kill my <number> year-old son . i was under the impression i would be meeting <person> <person> . 
i 'm getting real tired of this maniac . 
exactly that . we can put you inside someone else 's body for fifteen minutes . 
when was that ? 
well rest easy , i 'm not angry with either of you . 
you said this ship creates a gateway ... 
that was amazing . thanks so much . you did n't have to do that . 
you do ? 
dr. hirsch ? 
i already did . i mean , i talked to his wife , and she talked to him ... 
if i were as sure as you , mrs. rand , we would n't be here . i 'll tell you quite bluntly : for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety , we 've come to ask you to send mrs. holland away to st. thomas . 
uh , yes i am . and you are ? 
think there might be more iraqis ? 
was n't anywhere near this place— 
why ? 
do n't let the cops provoke you . we 're there to watch and take badge numbers ... 
what 's goin ' on , <person> ? 
uh-huh . 
jeez . and you think the british 'll share it with their allies ? 
how many bottles ? 
let 's get out of here . 
i 've gotten the 'sackaroo ' in many ways - but never in rhyme . 
you ? 
can you ? i 'm happy being a dealer . at least the punters keep their hands to themselves . 
working . <person> and i were going over some statements . 
no , sir ! 
great . i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend . think that might be possible ? 
you may not . and besides , it is irrelevant . 
what 'd you get ? 
i 'd come back -- 
you sure have a way with people . 
if i might explain , sir -- 
does it matter ? 
would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it ? 
it may be too soon to talk about it . when someone we care for dies we ... ... keep something of their 's . a tie , a pen . 
do n't sweat it . it 's over . 
what was your name again ? 
whet do you mean ? 
-- more than anyone she has ever met . in her whole life . 
i 'm trying to organize a boycott of <person> 's pizza joint . ya see what i 'm saying ? 
there must be a way ! what about engineering ? 
<number> thing i could never stand is to see a filthy , dirty old drunkie , howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp , blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts . i could never stand to see anyone like that , whatever his age might be , but more especially when he was real old like this <number> was . the boys stop and applaud him . 
i have no right to ask for help . i 've never thought of anybody but myself . 
i had him out this morning . 
that 's kind of ... extreme , <person> . <person> 's private life is none of our business . 
<person> <person> , am i a stuffed shirt ? am i a horse-faced hypocrite ? am i a new england school-marm ? 
out in back . 
is <person> <person> in ? 
you sure you 're down with this ? 
i read it in cosmopolitan . 
do you mind putting out the light ? 
hello ... ? 
excuse me , <person> -- - 
i need to repair my turbo boosters . do you people still use fossil fuels , or have you discovered crystalic fusion ? 
gambling 's not about money . 
where did you send the message to <person> <person> ? 
what brings you down from boston , <person> ? taking advantage of the long weekend ? 
twenty-five . 
his car 's still there . 
yeah . 
i thought you guys were busted . 
i did n't know you were into that sort of thing . 
how long 'till we can eject ?

something like that . 
south america ! 
who are they ? 
hey ! ! ! 
what ? 
your dad has <number> computer disks . they have funny names : <person> and <person> . 
just a boid in a gilded cage - 
i do n't think <person> cares that much that my ... that <person> left . 
<person> could pop the question at any time . 
why ? 
i 'm telling you that 's my car ! and someone 's gon na pay for it ! 
what ? 
will you ever look at him , sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book ! 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
because it 's the last thing in the world we need right now . 
only <person> ? 
oh , here and there . i flew something similar in my academy days . 
<person> chairman , there is an old saying : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . 
what did you do ? 
<person> then , at least call me <person> in my own goddam place . 
yeah , but i ai n't talking horse . i 'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that 's a quick ticket to heaven . and the fools keep coming back for more . 
no . for me to live with the ruin of my husband 's name , i need know that whoever did this will be punished . if you can find them , i will take their names to the police . i 'll say my husband confessed on his death bed . i 'll say i did n't have courage to come forward at first ... 
but i 'm the commander ! 
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real ? 
not that young . it 's been a long time since you 've called me that . 
the shawfish ? 
well ... we 'll leave her a note .

i 'll meet you down there . 
uhhh ... teeth . <person> . 
no no . no . you do n't understand . you ca n't make a deal with him . even if you gave him the money he 'd still kill you . he 's a peculiar man . you could even say that he has principles . principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that . he 's not like you . he 's not even like me . 
what do you want from me ? 
i 'm really afraid . 
at the moment , yes . 
i 'll do it . 
that 's what he says , but if he thinks that i do n't realize he 's writing another article , then he 's an idiot . 
kevin , next year ... with you in <person> <person> , and me in nashville ... it 's not gon na work , is it . 
umm , he got dark brownish eyes , he got a nice nose i love his nose . i love his skin . i love his lips , he got a great smile and he got- 
well , i do n't really listen to her when it comes to men . i mean , look at <person> , for crissake . oh , you went to school with him did n't you ? you 're probably friends or something . 
i 've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i 've never hit <number> with dough . this love-in-an-attic is n't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon . 
they did not ! 
harder . concentrate harder . 
what happened ? 
i told them to fall back ... 
what answers ? 
love it ! 
are you all right ? 
i 'm needing lunch . 
and i also believe in god and the devil . in fact , i know they exist . 
liar . she hates surprises . what are you ordering ? 
mary , i 'm amazed . did n't <person> tell you ? she sold the business to me at least <number> months ago . it 's my business now . 
why not ?

he 's just playing big brother . 
they 're all criminals ? 
<person> ! 
< u > are you intact < /u > ? 
what about cortina ? 
pause as he takes all this in i think your dad would miss you . 
at first the police thought he just ran away , but this afternoon dr. <person> found some blood spots on the carpet -- 
i mean , what were you doing ? were you a resident or on a staff someplace ? 
i already know about the riots , d'artagnan , i heard them out there whispering . some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food . i will deal with it tomorrow .

i 'm sorry ... .i 'm just so excited . you must have felt this way when you first met <person> , huh ? where did you <number> meet ? 
burt , can you hear me now ? 
it is n't always this rough ? 
well fuck , you guys could do this every day . 
anyplace really public , they 'd know about it -- they know everything at the committee , <person> -- 
for the third time . 
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here ? this will always be the ghetto . 
no -- 
elaine -- 
yeah ? 
we-are-mobilizing-to-defend- < u > her < /u > . 
i do n't know . it does n't matter . the thing is we got to get you back on your feet .

that 's me . 
did you decide , sir ? 
pham , we do n't want to be stuck on a couple of canners . they better be fast . 
i 'm afraid you 're blocking my view . 
the academy is fantastic ... of course , they wo n't teach you anything about flying you do n't already know . most of the instructors are very conservative pilots . you can fly circles around them ... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing , and you get a lot of discipline ... but after you graduate , do n't join the star force -- go free-lance . it 's the only way to get into the action ... i ca n't wait until my hitch is up . 
if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind , how do you go about getting an exorcism ? 
the `` chronicle '' is a good newspaper . 
looks like we 'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named <person> <person> . 
how did you know ? 
i want to learn to read it . 
coffin ? 
you ask me that counselor 's making a mountain out of a molehill ... 
temperature 's dropping .

my lord . 
but you know who she was . 
<person> mcmurphy , patients are not permitted to run around in towels . 
they 're <person> <person> style pretzels . 
hello , <person> ... 
i 'll give you a hint . `` ohhh , yeah , yeah ! '' comprende ? 
what are you ? 
that 's a nice tour . all booked ? when was <person> around here last ? 
i see ... well , those doctors are real miracle workers . 
maya . 
i 'm gon na open the shop , baby , i 'm gon na open the shop . i 'm getting it together . 
are you the <number> who left that note ? 
oh excuse me , i did n't realize you had a degree in medicine . are you a doctor ? are you a doctor ? answer me please , are you a doctor ? 
no , <person> ... be quiet ... be quiet now ... 
you gave me an hour ; now give me a day . 
so how 'd you get caught ? 
blood has been shed . we 've incurred risks , <person> . i 'm coming into town tomorrow . have the money ready . 
you do n't really think <person> and the girl are in league ? 
everyone 's all right ... ? 
has anybody talked to them ? 
all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all . 
i 'm going to fix you up with my new assistant . 
do you hear that ? that choir ? eddie , in here , that 's what they call music ! 
she never even looked at you . 
hello , <person> . 
do n't let it bother you so , wes . 
the joker is a murderer . and you were as good as dead . so -- 
shit . 
welsh again . 
i do n't think she can do it . you saw what happened . 
we did n't see anything - - did we ? 
some part of you suspects -- even if you do n't know for sure -- that what i 'm saying is true . 
god , <person> , i 'm not going to make <person> <person> . 
where is he , <person> ? 
you feeling okay , <person> <person> ? 
hi , <person> and <person> . 
now you need approval from him to go home ? 
i < u > did < /u > care how . 
that 's confidential information , little man . 
that 's right , sir . and do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . what if they start something ? 
i knew i could n't trust you . you told me you were taking me home . 
can i sleep in here with you tonight ? 
listen to me son . you got to swear . <person> means promise . first swear you 'll take care of little pearl . <person> her with your life , boy . then swear you wo n't never tell where that money 's hid . not even your mom . 
hello ! 
of course not . but -- how can i be efficient in the office if i do n't get enough sleep at night ? 
i 'm complimenting you . ca n't you ever just say `` thanks '' ? 
<person> , please do n't do this ... it wo n't ever be over like this . 
sweetheart -- 
<person> up ! jump in ! 
i think you should go with red . it 's the color of confidence . 
come on -- relax -- give them a drink . 
i like him a lot . 
you ever have the feeling that you 're not sure if you 're awake or still dreaming ? 
i hope it 's not your dear sweet mother ... 
what are you doing ? 
you ! 
no , not yet . i tried to work on it a little last night , but i 'm having trouble concentrating . 
and i 'd take it out on him . 
you told me you were pretty good with youngsters . today i bumped into an old friend of mine , mrs. wheeler she runs a settlement house down in the village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher . 
yes -- ? 
a leader , like <person> ? 
actually , it was <number> . you 're different , <person> <person> . you 're the first man in <number> years who did n't tell me i look like veronica lake inside of a minute . 
i 'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here ... .a weekly thing . 
sure you did . that 's what makes it great . what it needs is a little more dialogue . 
it 's funny . i can look back on a life of achievement , on challenges met , competitors bested , obstacles overcome . i 've accomplished more than most men , and without the use of my legs . what . . . what makes a man , <person> <person> ? 
is that what you 're looking for ? 
how do we do it ? 
yeah , <person> always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes . 
are n't we ... 
what goofy idea have you got now ? do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body . 
i do n't know . 
your his publicist ? 
she 's getting steamed 'cause i 'm still re-channeling my sexual energy -- maybe i should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down . what'ya think ? 
hey , girls . 
working hard ? 
come on . invite me . all day the idea of a family sunday dinner 's been coming into my head . since you 're the only <number> i know around here with family ... 
so ? 
welcome aboard , admiral . i believe you know my trainee crew . certainly they have come to know you . 
you sure you did n't say anything to maya ? 
if he 's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it wo n't matter . it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york , was n't it ? tell me the truth . 
michael - i 'm sorry ... just give me - 
are you sure you can drive ? you 've really had a lot of alcohol . 
<person> , it could happen to me all over again , do n't you see ? i could start to -- 
her family name ? 
yeah , but please do n't do that . 
i got bored in saigon . 
before we kill her or cure her.. 
i told you . you have to be optimistic . believe in them ... 
mitch ? why are they doing this ? the birds . 
gotcha . 
even in berlin . 
they must stay sharp . there was an attempt on the king 's life today . 
it 's true , <person> . 
uncharted . we 'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan . 
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ? 
rachel ! what are you doing here ? i thought i was supposed to pick you up ? 
you must also do something about the public meetings . i see this , memorandum circulating , with tibetan grievances . 
i do n't gamble . 
you could call it that . my eyes are open . 
you 're a tough one , are n't you ? 
how are you feeling , <person> <person> ? how is your mind today ? 
good . 
we must take action on this immediately . 
i think it 's too late for changes , <person> . i promised myself i would n't talk about it and i 've gone and spoiled it . 
nope . 
do n't push me.. ! 
listen , forget the shoes . i 'll just take a cab ... uh ... 
what 's wrong ? 

your completely missing the point . 
you must shut off the power , this is very important do you understa- 
you do it ! 
you 'd worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support . 
but you see , it is n't blarney where you 're concerned . 
<number> years ! <number> years later and out of your paycheck , i never charge interest -- 
a <person> <person> and a man called <person> . 
then he drove me home . he tried to put himself away as legit , so i went right into the pitch .

applejack drove . 
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns . if we do n't blow them - who will ? 
i get it walter . i get it . 
and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ? 
of course not . 
clarence ? 
well , i dunno . i mean , when you looked at all the other options ... it just seemed sorta obvious . 
it 's something users do . 
no , i came because we need - 
cindy , let me ... 
that 's right , but i do n't understand- 
if he does come in i 'm not here ... what were you drinking , <person> ?

that 's than un on christmas i was tellin ' you about . 
you want to borrow the car ? you do n't have a license . 
all i 'm saying is , you wo n't trip over me if you look her up . 
that 's what i thought . so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late , you know . 
<person> andy , disapproves of my coiffure ? 
geez , i forgot how heavy these things are . 
`` and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms ... '' 
... because you hurt me , <person> how you hurt me . can you imagine , marrying another man ? did i do something to make you do that ? did i ever turn you down , or anything ? the only thing i could n't do , you 're gon na laugh , is go on top - i got this fear of high places ! and i let myself get fat . 
it 's deceiving . 
nope . the switchboard is lightning up downtown . kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school . it 's turning into woodstock except there 's no concert . 
new hitman wants to leave his mark 
you really need that much ? 
yeah , yeah ... . this father <person> , what 's his racket ? 
shit ! you bought enough pate for a fucking army ! 
<person> jung , do n't you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case ? 
and ? -- and ? -- 
oh ? 
it 's so -- so stark . 
- - a gizzard - - 
i do n't understand that , <person> <person> . 
the queen of england ? 
if she comes down here , so help me i 'm gon na mash her brains in . everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her . since then , forget it . 
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence , but if we were more often able to ensure justice , after the fact , then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement . 
hey , <number> days with him is enough . 
sure . lots of times . 
yes . 
not at all . morning tom . 
well , you and junior have the same name , too , do n't you ? 
edward . my name is <person> . 
- no matter where he was or what he was doing , he always went home to make breakfast for his son , nicky- boy . 
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl ! 
if you 're not at my place by <number> , <person> and i are running off together . 
i 'm not hurt . it does n't hurt you when somebody pisses on you , it just pissed you off . 
. 
we certainly do . <person> 's over - starting right after dinner . but right now - that lady over there - - that 's the new society editor , i take it ? you think i could interrupt her a moment , <person> <person> ? 
so , the guy goes to hell and the devil says , `` do you smoke ? '' the guy say , `` yeah '' ... the devil say , `` great cause tuesday is cigar night , sweetest cuban cigars you ever had . '' 
<person> <person> felt the public should own the display . the water . if you 'll just read the display . 
ca n't they shut that off ? 
forty bucks ...

sally ? 
that you , valerian ? 
i walked away . he said abort . he was gone so i walked away . 
i think you better put him on ice , man . 
it 's <person> . 
i 've had a long time to make enemies , dr. arroway . there are many governments , business interests , even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear . and i will grant them their wish soon enough ... but before i do , i wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who 've given -- from whom i 've taken so much . 
what happens now ? 
and getting closer every minute . here . drink up . we 'll never finish the other <number> . 
..who would benefit from his disappearance ? < u > no < /u > <number> . no one has but lost by it ... 
halo ? < u > <person> < /u > ? what would they have used instead of an old mill ? we need it tonight . <person> ? yeah you were saying ... ? 
no . but now that you mention it , i did talk to a handsome executive at paramount the other day ... who just happened to get his hands on the script . 
me ? ! i would n't even be in this situation if it was n't for you . you brought down so much fuckin ' heat on me . i mean , every time i meet somebody here , the big question is do i know you .

right . they do n't trust ! they do n't trust america ! 
how do we prove it ? 
i do n't want to see you anymore . 
why ? 
you are bringing in wrong values . <person> is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological , or shall we say chemical , process . a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it . 
something 's haywire , 
i guess so . she said not to be late . 
he farted on meringue ; he sneezed on braised endive ; and , with creme of mushroom soup , well ... 
what do you wan na watch ? we 've got crap , crap , crap or crap 
no way . 
i like women like that ! 
yeah ? 
he ca n't stay up there . 
could we cut all news off ? i know -- 
what kind of stupid question is that ? 
sure ! 
did he hear you ? 
well , call general mcaddie . 
find my brother <person> . give him this . i have duties he must fulfill in my stead . only family can be trusted . 
i 'm ready . 
... who 'd ya fight ? 
daddy -- 
i wan na see <person> <person> 's breasts . when do we see <person> <person> 's breasts ? 
what is it ? 
-- mouth-to-mouth , which could maybe ... 
what for ? to play <person> again ? 
i 'll wait . 
um ... 
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms , which does n't exactly put people at ease . is he cute ? 
quite touching . 
yes . 
man , we totally annihilated his night-stalkin ' ass ! 
gave all that up . going into business . 
yeah ? 
and your principles ? 
are you threatening me with legal action , <person> <person> ? 
what guy that died ? 
no . this has been going on for some time . several months . about <number> months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river . they were from people who were reported missing . they never found <number> complete body . only parts . 
no . i 'm sorry . 
thank you very much , clarence . 
you mean a nano—tech synthetic organism . 
i 'm not sure , guy , but i do n't think dyslexia is a virus . 
you know my dad takes <number> red cold pills every day ? he and my mom have cocktail hour every night , from <number> to <number> , set your clock , <number> bourbons -- 
outside ? 
who owns this town ? who runs every goddamn studio ? the tribe , baby . these fuckers hear the word `` jew '' and they start sweating . like <person> <person> ' pool they start sweating . 
i said -- i mean -- washington did n't live to see it finished . congress did n't move here from philadelphia till eighteen hundred . 
jean ? 
you 're asking me a direct question ? 
i heared it cryin ' a little through that box . 
so i 'll meet you at the restaraunt ? 
oh , <person> , dj , what do i ... how do i ... 
to us it was . 
what the fuck do you want ? 
that 's because we did n't have a wedding . your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me . she was engaged to somebody else . 
ugh ... 
the cobra 's waitin ' to strike , chica . 
if you 're such a devoted fan , why were you at the play tonight instead of the game ? answer carefully . this is important . you could have gone to the theater last night . there was no game last night . 
... page <number> , 'if a patient has taken nourishment within <number> hour prior to inducement , general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to <person> <person> <person> ? she aspirated into her mask ? 
he 's the assistant chief of anesthesiology , <person> <person> . he says your doctors , <person> and <person> , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we do n't know is why . what went on in there ? in the o.r . that 's what we 'd like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang ... someone got distracted ... what ? 
people think that you 're me , because you and i happen to share the same body . 
tricked us ! 
it 's been a very strange day . 
i do n't want to take any more chances . 
our former commander was not ... strong . 
i 'll tell you what : i should go in there , volunteer to fill up his female quota . 
that 's what i know . 
that 's none of your business . get the keys . 
the play 's going to be really good . 
you think i 'm fake . 
what you do n't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy . 
when you get to ostia , use this -- bribe passage to africa or spain . save my family . you should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to egypt then to numidia . 
i got it . 
but you do n't believe it . 
she 's asleep . 
would n't be a favor if you were paying me . i 'll just take my <number> when the deal is done . 
what about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick ? i 'd hate to think he ... 
now , are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself ? there are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing . 
morons . 
why ? 
no , i do n't mean you have to . it 's just that we may not have enough -- 
you were supposed to be this colossus . you were this great , legendary thing . and yet he gains . 
poison gas . 
no - no lights . we do n't want anyone to know we 're having a party . 
yes ? 
bad beat today . 
i knew him for twenty years - at least i thought i knew him . i suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time . 
what ? 
can you play it ? 
whoa , hans , now you 're the cowboy ? 
i am only a messenger . do you accept ? you will be paid well . 
how long does it last ? 
did you do any of that ? 
the feds . it 's evidence . 
yes , your highness . 
who else is interested in me ? 
if you want . 
i made a decision , because i have to consider the integrity of the scene . i ca n't worry whether you think you 're getting enough time on the playing field . 
but i can run much faster than you ... i am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second ... 
oh , no . please do n't make me go by myself . i 'm scaaaaaaaaaared . 
black ... 
wait . <person> down . a film like this , <number> , cost <number> <number> <number> dollars , sold outright , shown in peep machines , maybe theatres , maybe not , is almost impossible to track . 'nobody ' makes it ; 'nobody ' shows it ; 'nobody ' sees it . it 's like it does n't even exist . 
well , go on ! go berserk ! 
cobb , you 've got nothing i need . 
let 's wait and see how you survive your first crisis , <person> ... 
i 'm taking a shower . 
fbi too ? 
what 's wrong with making friends ? 
seek you the bridge of death ... 
that 's surprising . he was leaving your office at the time ... 
thanks for the lift , <person> . 
accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . <person> worked with <person> <person> until <person> retired in 'seventy-eight . since then he 's been on his own . <number> cases before the circuit court . he lost them all . he drinks . 
somebody has to die . 
what is it ? 
all right . all right . 
you 're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance , are you ? 
then why not just fuckin ' say better than expected ? everybody knows what better than expected means . 
blood 's thoroughly oxygenated . 
<person> rizzo from the bronx . do n't mind if i do . 
jeff for senator . 
oh , stop it . but you were having an affair with your college professor . that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course `` contemporary crisis in western man '' ! 
it stinks . i thought woman were independent now . 
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon ? 
hey , mack ! 
i was special . the only colored kid in class . i became a sort of mascot . like a pink poodle . 
goodness . 
do n't worry about paley . he ca n't touch me . no one can . i 've thought it all out . 
maybe it 's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message . burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe . it could be to humiliate them . just burning them up , no proper funeral , it 's like condemning them to hell . 
pendergast ! help ! it 's right behind us ! 
what ? 
laz ... you ca n't say nothin ' ... 
can we go home soon <person> ? 
excuse me ? 
like amnesia . 
it 's possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time , but i was n't diagnosed until several years later . 
yes sir . 
then i can pull this trigger , and it wo n't matter . 
now comrades , i warn you ... if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble . 
how soon ? 
it 's a four-man operation . <number> on the ground . <number> in the air . 
not as a rule . 
beth ? now you 've got <person> killing people ? 
i wo n't do your portion of kitchen cleanup . 
for that matter , i think you will too . 
good things about <person> <person> ? could take some time ! ... <person> is talented . <person> is tender ... <person> is beautiful ... 
so would i . 
shut up . 
you woulda ? 
you <number> sees like a perfect fit . only <number> mounths ... ? 
i thought he 'd stopped doing horror . 
when you are , miss . 
`` old macdonald ... had -- '' 
what were the yards like ? 
it do n't look right . 
then why did you have anything to do with him ? 
what now ? 
-- look , when the watergate grand jury questioned you , did you name names ? 
yes . it will be a book in my honor . for saving your life and nursing you back to health . i 'll be the first <number> to read it . oh , <person> , you 're going to make me the envy of the whole world ... 
eventually , <person> . but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them ... 
hide . run to the ends of the earth till you learn . you must learn to defend yourself . in this i can help . 
why ? 
look . that telegram was all scrambled . it was actually from thompson , not to him . <person> <person> must have gotten the names reversed . i have to get going . i have to get out to the track . 
<person> grusinskaya -- at once -- 
<person> -- 
they 're a bit overworked these days . luckily i intercepted your call . 
whoah , what a day , huh ? 
<number> dollars -- was $ <number> . 
i 'd like to commission a work . i 'm a great admirer of yours . 
oh yes , great . the only problem is , he ca n't remember what he came to tell us . 
try to kiss my butt just once before i 'm transferred . 
<person> 's ok . 
underground deposit ? 
what 's with the boxes ? 
well ... if you 're sure that i could accomplish everything in a week ... i suppose i could manage it . 
why do n't you just go outdoors , mister ? cool off . 
if there 's a train . 
but , buddy , you were -- 
not true , sir . it was only a slight tolchock . she was breathing , i swear it . 
you know what we want . 
i 've seen them all before . 
i asked for the man in charge ... 
put your gun down ! ! 
it 's coming . hold her down . 
well , he has been pushing me to meet his father , but i 've been putting it off . 
morning . 
yes 
the alps . 
in case of fire , how long will it take to empty this place ? 
come on , we 've been double dating since the fourth grade . 
big bird touches down < u > when < /u > ? 
looks like those boys are headed south , so they were n't the same ones that jumped me . <person> way you going ? 
bree -- honey - please , we 're waiting for someone . 
toy wit ' this will ya . 
i know how that can be . 
china . 
make a pass or something . is n't that the way it goes ? 
do n't take that . tell him to shut the fuck up . 
the little skate-fuckers . 
time for lunch . 
excuse me ? 
that thing gives me the creeps . 
the law is often inconvenient , colonel ... 
the shot ? 
i do n't have a ring ! 
i ca n't ... the car vanishes and all of a sudden i 'm on the ground in the woods . 
y- s-sure it did . 
how do you know ? personal experience ? 
what do you see ? 
jumbo , where the hell are the women ? 
where 's <person> ? 
i know . she 's so young and he 's so - 
so you say .

i see . and are you in touch with mrs. sizemore ? 
so they shot him ! so he was dead . so what . he 's worse than dead now . he 's a piece of shit ... 
i see . <person> brought them all . that 's all right . we 'll give them a drink and throw 'em out . how 's that ? 
i did n't aim to . 
where 's the beauty you promised me ? 
i 'll smile when it 's funny . 
you got a nice tan , though . 
call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid . can i have the keys to your house ? 
it 's all this craziness ! it 's what we 've been living since <number> , when we left the army . <number> of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who 's politics ? not ours .

well , there 's a lot of communistic sympathizers around -- 
you 're fine like that , <person> .

shit , <person> ! 
i can see where i wo n't talk much to you . 
ah , <person> .

what ? what 's this ? 
`` the gang made off with thirty-five <number> dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land ! '' who wrote this ! ? i 'll see him hanged every tuesday for a month ! 
i came to say goodbye . 
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money . 
i do n't know . 
what is your uncle 's name ? 
oui . <person> 's silk suit , just like you asked . 
nobody . 
throw me out - because i 'm beginning to get goofy ideas , and they concern you , <person> . 
i think he kind of liked me ... is that so hard to imagine ? 
and what happened to von der <person> ? 
i never knew that music like that was possible . 
this is a .44 <person> , the most powerful handgun in the world . you got ta ask yourself just <number> question . are you feelin ' lucky ? 
and a lot of time . 
but when you finlsh a job , afterwards do you think about them ?

eddie ... what 's a dd-5 ? 
i did n't know what was going to happen . i was just so worried something was going to happen to you . 
kate ? 
freddie ? 
it 's not safe here . the whole country 's crawling with <person> and germans and god knows what . it 's madness . i ca n't allow it . you 're not , this is natural - it 's shock . for all of us . <person> - 
... you the press office ? 
do n't tell me where to work . i moved to new york to work for <person> <person> . but i ca n't believe that <person> <person> has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little -- 
what happened ? were you kicked out ? 
none at all ? how about those 'underground ' comics ? 
i 'll change back before we leave . 
i 'm sorry about your financial problems . i really am . but they are your problems . 
i believe you . 
you heard right . 
looks like you company can write off its share of this colony . 
of a fight he ca n't win out here . 
we have . 
why ? 
listen to me , listen to me ... i 've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something . this newcomer <person> <person> has it , whatever it is , the x factor , that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks , and i want that cat in my hands . are you listening to me ? 
what sheets ? 
lord no -- charming -- but why <number> meal a day ? 
i know . i think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves . 
they rival the angels of paradise . 
that 's <number> . so . why did you decide to deejay again ? 
oh god , i do n't think so . 
i guess it 's time to hit the road . 
suicidal . it 's much less codependent . 
not anymore . this is a distribution network out of south florida , moving poly-drug loads , crystal meth through coke , to nashville , atlanta , <person> , cleveland . and computer fraud , identity theft . it 's like that . 
scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs . 
my apologies . i had no business snapping at you . 
all right , you did n't know . 
well ... this . 
my life was totally crappy , <person> , and she ... fixed it . she made me happy . which i 'd never been . she loves me the way i am - < u > right now < /u > . < i > < /i > i do n't want everything to change . i do n't want her saying yes to some big success . i just want her saying yes to me . 
oh , i 've got to find it . 
my mommy and <person> did that ? 
as always , your keen powers of perception astound me . and you 're right . i 've come to celebrate . after thirty-two years as psychiatric administrator , guess who has been named <person> 's groves new chief of staff . 
how did you do that , <person> ? 
now what ? 
me neither ... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches . 
what 's the message ? 
<person> christ . <person> <person> , when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons , i do n't call ahead for an appointment .

of course ! you want out ?

anywhere from <number> weeks , to several months . 
every now and then , some elder statesman of the theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk . ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings . 
how 'd < u > you < /u > get in there ? 
lookin ' for a job ? 
mmmm ... thanks , i needed this . 
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we 've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not . 
well , try , huh . 
'salt <person> <person> , please . i do not speak english . '

sooner or later you 'll learn to trust me . 
dr. winkel ? who is he ? 
son-of-a-bitch . how the hell did you get oklahoma-michigan ? nobody ever had oklahoma-mi ... how the hell 'd you do it ? 
okay , i 'll take care of jessica . 
i 've talked to <person> <person> , and he says ... 
he bled a bunch , but no , there was no peeing . 
does that cost extra or you throw them in ? 
that felt good to do ... to do what i wanted to do . 
if you 're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty , forget it . 
it is called 'the <person> <person> ' and there are only <number> left . in <number> the owner of <number> was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it . 
stop , stop ... i ca n't remember ! the battles were all so confusing ... there was so much smoke , dust , noise ... i was being attacked on all sides , so ... maybe ... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself ... 
a big , rich slob like d. b. norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off ! 
with an indian representative out there , we hope to keep hostilities dormant ; this is a cointelpro , <person> <person> <person> , and it 'll be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people 's trust and maybe -- 
thanks ... i love you . 
is it like <person> ? are we goofing ? 
fuck 'em . they do n't know what they 're missing . 
thank you . 
... office <number> .

well , i 'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal . you can sleep through it . 
so they build another death star , right ? 
for keeps . 
it 's <person> . open the door . 
i think it 's important not to get depressed . depression is a terrible thing . they say it can bring on illness .

what happened to denver ? 
_ your father raped someone ? 
... yes she did . 
why ? 
why not ? 
yeah , this is <person> . 
okay , i have <number> that says this is it for them . 
<person> , has <person> persisted in his werewolf fantasies ? 
did you ? 
i 'm sorry i ca n't tell you more about your father 's death , <person> <person> . our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine grove 's staff changed and i 'm afraid we did n't have the best record system before then . 
yeah , smaller countries do n't computerize customs records - 
-- or incredibly fucking naive . 
when will you be , do you think ? -- when are we going to know it all ? 
write her out a receipt , <person> . give her a receipt for these letters too . 
i just do n't excite you at all ... i do n't know what you want ... i do n't know what you like ... 
mitch , th'marty <person> , i 'm here in ... 
oh right ... so it 's just complicated for you and <person> -- for me it 's pretty simple cause i just do n't understand ... 
cuz i 'm a skin ? 
cats and dogs out there , huh ? 
you 're primary , you 're secondary , you 're point man .

what about the untouchables ? 
i 'll never experience my fantasy of <number> sex droids , <number> humans , and a knofflapod . <person> . 

thanks officer <person> ... vance . 
that 's not what i was thinking . what i was thinking was ... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out .

nah . 
merle ? ... <person> 's alive ? how do you know ? 
fraulein -- will you permit me ?

here 's my problem , <person> . you told me you and <person> were good friends for a long time ? 
oh , please . i know what 's coming , now . `` let me help you ... '' 
well of course . 
what are you doing ? 
it 's not a truck . it 's the rolls royce of eighteen-wheelers . 
pleased to meet you . 
yeah , you betcha . 
<person> pomponi . she says everything is all set for the reception . 
what did you get ? 
ignorance ! i believe the indies are no more than <number> leagues west of the canary islands . 
nothing i did n't deserve . 
what ? 
<person> dae yung . north korean nuclear specialist . 
the duck ? 
you did n't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you ? 
<person> , this is positively the best misery you 've ever written . 
it is n't done , gentlemen ! it is n't done , i say ! it is n't done ! 
uh , i 'm very proud to say that we have <number> children . 
yes , i guess it was <number> , <number> ... 
well , how about this ? 
take a good look around . there 's nobody in this place -- you 're meetin ' the reason why . what 'll it be ? 
there is n't much time ! 
an hour ? what 's an hour ! you know how time flies , <person> . my tie ? get it .

yes , i know <person> <person> . 
what does it say . 
may i cut in , miss ? 
that 'd be fine . 
you paid cash ? 
paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me . he 's a lifer , what does he care . paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead . once the wound healed up ... got out of the mountain this morning . and tonight i 'm a rich man . 
save that for the tribune . 
<number> vodka martinis , straight up , shaken not stirred , very dry , easy on the water . 
the way things turned out , i do n't need to tell you - <person> <person> <person> was no rosebud ! 
well , after a few years , we got sort of impatient . dr . <person> , i want you to meet your son . 
i 've heard of you , too . you were in <number> with bargamian . 
it can louse up your insides . you can get puh , puh , puh ... 
oh , yeah .

we 're moving you tomorrow .

in heaven there would n't be dust on the wallpaper . 
oh , it 's very complicated , huh ?

a whole ten cents ? ! 
you believe that ? 
right . <person> smoke , low roll . couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal . so young fireman <person> and <person> <person> , they head up stairs , get out on the fire escape -- mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across ... what were you feeling , brian ? c'mon , you promised . be honest . <person> ... <person> ! 
get in . you ’ re leaving . 
i 'll get my clothes all wrinkled . 
what are you doing ? 
who was the last <number> to see her alive ? 
big man ! 
so which <number> of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world ? how do we work with them if there 's been a hard-line coup ? 
-- i do n't care who you are . you could 've been killed . every man and woman in here has done hard prison time . and we look out for each other . 
you 'll get over it . we 've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against <person> <person> <person> . 
why me ? 
you clever bastard ! i might have guessed . you only moved in today and you 're already hot on the bloody trail . 
lauren 's father 's involved . he bought the cops fancy cars , i do n't know what else . it 's a company called d-e-l-t . i think <person> found out . 
i 'd love to see your work . 
hello . <person> about that graduation present . <person> quite a car . <person> , i know you 're busy , you do n't ' have to retain me , but you can trust me . i 'll tell you a couple of things about myself , i 'm nineteen , been overseas for a couple of semesters , but now i 'm back . i 'm an athlete , so i rarely drink . kickboxing . you heard of kickboxing , sport of the future ? <person> 'the <person> ' <person> , <person> [ ? ] merciless , <number> of the champions of the sport ? i can see by your face , no . my point is , you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next <number> to <number> hours . 
no . 
where 's your mom ? 
if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way ... 
that is n't true . 
i do n't know how to thank you . 
<person> campbell ? 
this , i do n't know , maybe you can trade it for something . 
why not ? 
i like it here , <person> . i 'm never going to leave . 
i 'm staying right here . doing my job . fighting to get my show on the air . you do n't like it ? hey , i 'll tell you what ... fire my ass ... 
in other words , all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections . 
you know , that 's real sweet music in there . you can almost smell the action and the money . you know , i can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes . 
you know where my father is , do n't you , <person> <person> ? 
but <person> , you 're the only ... 
do you know , i never knew he worked in <number> of my places ! 
oh <person> , i 'm not anti-male , i 'm anti- you . believe me , there 's a difference . <person> is designing new uniforms for next week . pay her and thank her . and is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning . there 's something out there called <number> degrees , look into it . 
can you protect us ? 
i duped these prints off him . can you run an i.d . ? 
now you hear obscene chewing . you 're losing it , <person> . 
who is v'ger ? 
getting cold . 
can i come in ? 
<number> ? 
`` love me love me love me ... put me on t.v . '' that 's the iconography of rascism , man ! 
buying some drugs , alright ? 
if he had n't found that deputy job , i believe <person> might 've gone down the other path , got into some serious trouble . settled him right down . that and your mother . 'course he had that other <number> later . 
aye , sir . 
are you impressed with our anastasia ? 
if you pull this off , i ca n't promise i wo n't kill you . i mean , who we trying to kid ? but i will spare the flying nun here ... . 
what and ? that 's what i got . 
i 'm sure there is a way , <person> . some kind of a little contest . i could perhaps put together a small committee , and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty 's wishes . 
you want company ? 
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities . 
then its authority is in doubt . 
you missed ... <person> took a taxi to the hotel across the street . made a phone call . 
just luck , this , really . never been to <number> of these before . 
good lord . 
i know . 
shit , i wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em . 
i ca n't help it if men notice me . 
indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing . 
zerzura , the white city of acacias , the oasis of little birds . as me about the scent of acacia - it 's in this room . i can smell it . the taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth . i can taste it . i 'm chewing the mint . is there sand in my eyes ? are you cleaning sand from my ears ? 
now we love <person> and <person> in verbo- ten ? what 's going on ? 
what 's up ? 
<person> acknowledged . 
you know i am only too happy to be of help to you , but surely this is n't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters . 
i have to . 
you think he 's bluffing ? 
you mean this is -- goodbye ? 
you got the warrant ? 
got a warrant ? 
<person> <person> says that someone did n't put a right bolt in the bus ... 
it started way before i was around . i think basically it 's because he thinks <person> is a complete idiot . but <person> runs chicago because <person> is his father . 
so what ? 
what 's going on ? 
yes ma'am ? 
it 's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days . 
good luck . 
come with me . the team 's already waiting . 
jesus , man ... 
yes , <person> . 
should i hit it ? 
yeah . i got a letter from <person> <person> . she says if we do n't stop over at wilkes-barre she 'll never forgive us . 
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs. leeds and i 'll tell you if you 're right or not . 
i ca n't seem to let go of you ...

excuse me . what did you say ? 
and he never hit you before ? 
i 've never been given a fair shot . 
the ghost is close . he almost got us . <person> is hurt . 
<person> that 's a real _bonehead_ thing to say ! 
thanks . 
they are trying to override the access codes . <person> is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and ... 
yeah . i 'm surprised . it 's really old ... <person> well though . you know , the world looks a lot better from up here . 
the same . 
not exactly . it exists in a continuum that was n't proven until <number> years ago , a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe . an infinite number of them , in fact . it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe , space , or space-time . it was completely counter-intuitive . we had to unlearn everything . 
what is it ? 
well ... i guess it 's okay for me to tell you now . that reputation of his is n't going anywhere . <person> comes to me and says , `` <person> , i need help with this , blah blah , etcetera . '' so i told him , pay me two- hundred bucks , and i 'll tell a couple girls that you 're dynamite in bed . so he did , and i did . 
because , <person> . it 's a cure . 
where is <person> <person> ?

i just need to find my brothers and be on my way , <person> . 
you 'd say if you mind ? 
well , i was worried about you and i wanted to make sure you were alright ... and i guess i was sort of hoping i could ask you about what happened ...

it 's not ergot , it 's not pituitary extract , it 's not oil of rue ... 
she seemed to take it pretty well . 
so what makes you think he 'll play for us ?

how 's the weather down there ? 
all anybody saw was <person> <person> drinkin ' coffee . 
`` fucked me . '' 
nothing ... just taking his teeth . 
what is this , some kind of joke ? 
i w- i was gon na be back before she woke up .

it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . you saw it coming as well as i did . <person> had his plans , starting with scuttling the boat . and greer too , except he went nuts . could n't take it , i guess . could 've happened in the middle of downtown anchorage . but did it make him any less dangerous ? i do n't think so . 
look , colonel ... we 're all adults here . this is a war . a very quiet , very intense war . people get sacrificed . 
sure .

we could give it a try . i 'll bring the wine , you bring the scarred psyche . 
maybe he 's got it right . maybe we 're all just looking for a safe place to shit . 
maybe we should just sit for a while . it 's very peaceful . 
nah , they were dead-ass asleep . but on every guard 's chest , they left <number> marlboro cigarette . just a little calling card to say they 'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted . 
art mo-o-o-ney !

alpha , my sensors tell me the rangers were too late ! <person> is on his way here !

why not ? ! 
i like you , <person> . 
you see , when you travel , everything is small , self-contained -- 
why did n't you tell me you had a daughter ? 
you 're upset , huh ? 
that explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move . 
i hope the best for you , <person> <person> , with your school and your paper and all . 
okay sure . what about ? 
now what ? 
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved , that 's true , but i hardly think ... 
yeah , i'm-i'm-i 'm a wreck .

i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress . 
what about <person> ? 
anyway , major , why should he leave his country , his mother tongue , his family , his history , his past , his future , just because now , suddenly , there is a dictatorship ? why ? 
home in on the strongest signal . descend from orbit . 
i 'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this ... but it 's a bit of an emergency . 
pretty sure . 
what ? 
what is it ? 
mojitas ... ? 
like what , <person> <person> ? 
seventy-one ? what 's seventy-one ? 
yah , it 's pretty darned busy here , but that 's the way we like it . 
i do n't know . 
hey look , it 's sausalito . 
now let 's forget everything except that we 're together . 
what ? ! you 're calling me a stalker ? 
no , let me go . 
i 'm afraid she 's gon na destroy stuff . 
somebody 's got to do it -- 
are you gon na call him , <person> ? 
hey , you alright ? 
i 'm sorry amanda . i am . and i 'm sorry for the things i said about him . 
your honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long . it concerns <number> thing alone -- the transference , barter and sale of a certain piece of property , to wit , his soul by <person> <person> . that transference , barter or sale is attested by a deed . i offer that deed in evidence and mark it exhibit a . 
you do n't think i fuck you , bitch ? i 'll fuck you . 
i ca n't go to work with my hair dyed pink . and i can afford to go shopping more now , and i 've met a couple people i like over the last year or so . 
yeah . 
well , would you want him to call you ? or , you want to call him ? how do you want to do it ? 
<person> ? 
then i 'll come back , then . 
okay , here we go . 
how long will we have to stay down here ? 
and it 's not right to the customers . 
i just want to know what your game is , mister , that 's all . 
she is not your birth mother , is she ? 
i believe it too . he really just wants her to be happy . 
it 's unbelievable . 
so far they 're keeping their part of it . 
tell me how it happens . 
that 's a good idea - telephone the police . the number is spring <number> . get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge . 
all right . 
what ? 
we came to stop you waking the gods , <person> ! but i did n't want anyone to get hurt ! 
oh , tell the story . 
okay , <person> <person> , who did it ? 
you used my name and my column to blackmail <person> into getting you the part of `` cora '' - and you lied to me about it ! 
sid , cut the crap . i -- 
in case you 've forgotten , we 're being paid to be here . so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency . 
you lost twenty-five dollars once before that , too , near christmas time -- i remember that real well now . december <number> , to be exact . 
... not the bat ? 
you must do me this honor ... promise me you will survive ... that you will never give up ... no matter what happens ... no matter how hopeless ... promise me now , and never let go of that promise . 
how did you get here ? did you play the game ? ! 
what the hell are we going to do ? ! 
nice boat . 
why ? 
well , you do n't have to lose your temper ! 
... metro intelligence cop . but it did n't matter . i mean , it was all about the kids , you know . 
right , the emperor . now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure , yes ? 
well good . so you 're human . 
i 'd wash that out with some iodine ... <person> , mercurochrome . 
but you did suspect me . 
give it back to him . we 're leavin ' . 
what 's that ? 
well <person> was being very thorough . 
now remember ... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence . 
and i almost got digested . it goes with the job . 
i will , <person> . but you 're going to be well enough to direct it yourself . 
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this . this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm . <number> misstep and we 're doing `` amos and <person> . '' only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain . 
what are you going to talk to me about ? 
it 's the people close to me that tend to die ... and i get the feeling you and i are going to be real buddies . terms ? 
i sleep with my spats on . 
why were you suspended ? 
beautiful . 
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week . 
to us ! 
where is that ? 
-- that is n't funny -- 
raptors , mostly . 
where 's the old bag i sometimes call <person> ? 
<person> grossie . 
and smooth ... almost no movement - back and forth , i mean . 
we 'll still be able to talk when i 'm away . the conversation will just keep getting longer . 
what 're your taking down ? 
any clue as to what it is ? 
it was a job . so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face . 
i was not disposed to discuss ... matters of a personal nature . for that , i 'm sorry . 
madeleine -- 
i see . may i ? 
valet ? you jest of course . i am a u.s . <person> . 
you 've never built in africa . 
... on holiday ? 
i hope they fucking fry us all . 
how do we get in ? 
friends do n't help other friends cheat . 
you afeared of the zulus then , <person> ? 
yes ? 
why should you do that ? 
speaking of <person> , there 's more good news : you wo n't even have to change your last name . you 'll always be mrs. peel . 
ah hell , he 'd do the same for me . 
have you seen him ? 
you will , eh ? well , we 'll see about that . all right , boys . take it . 
yeah . 
no - the ukulele . and i sing . 
if <person> were alive he would say , `` <person> , comrade , for once in your life you 're in paris . do n't be a fool . go in there and ring <number> times . '' 
yeah , but . 
are you gon na start it up ? 
... i always thought when i got older god would sort of come into my life in some way . he did n't . i do n't blame him . if i was him i 'd have the same opinion about me that he does . 
they look pretty docile . 
look , colonel . i 've got to talk to somebody at air command . 
am i wrecking my car ? 
some people do it to be funny 
wait i ... 
birdy ... i did n't mean to -- 
no ! 
and what if something happens to you ? am i suppose to go in after you alone ? ! 
i took the kids to my sister 's . 
<person> <person> ... 
you know , dear , we 're drifting apart , you and i , and i do n't like that . 
you 'll look like you consciously worked for the look . 
why -- <person> put it there to kill -- 
i 'm not sad , no , i owe the captain my life . it 's just you think you want to help prevent crime , but you realize that 's too complicated . it 's a lot more fun to punish crime . then after a while , you do n't care what 's a crime and what 's not , what you became a warrior for . you just want the kicks . the rush . 
come on . you ca n't stay here . 
honey , you 're not supposed to do that . 
you can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters . 
i 'm sorry sam could n't make it . 
told you , did he ? 
yeah but you do n't even know me really . 
the ticket is thirty dollars . 
no , sir . it 's more of a perceptual issue . 
i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it . 
josé ... 
yeah , well , we 're not . 
but you just got ta hear me out on <number> thing . you 're very responsible with <person> and you know it 's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man 's voice in the house . 
i could n't do it , leah ! it smelled like a dentist in there . they had these really horrible magazines , with , like , spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains , like someone read them in the tub . and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers , and she told me about her boyfriend 's pie balls , and su-chin <person> was there , and she told me the baby had fingernails . fingernails ! 
because see , my mother was banging the milkman . 
who the hell are you ? 
anything i can help you with ? 
<person> ... 
yes , this afternoon . i was grilling <person> about your marriage this afternoon . 
barefaced . 
... bed . 
you getting a reading on them ? 
it 's a confidential psychiatric record , it 'd be illegal -- she backs into a wall . she looks very scared . he comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall . 
no we do n't . but that 's where we 're going . from minden we take a stage to <person> , then another one over to auburn and another <number> to placerville . then it 's a day 's trip to sonora . 
i 'm very nervous . 
her . that look . she likes the ed guy better than she likes the brother . 
it 's interesting . 
oh . <person> . 
so waddaya feel like doing tonight ? 
what happened ? 
course he can talk . he 's a human being , like . is n't he ? 
anything else , <person> <person> ? how about some water ? 
i 'm just some big clown to you , ai n't i ? 
so tell them the truth . what do you use it for ? 
all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance . 
if you ca n't deal with him on that basis , you better get a new counselor . 
no , she 's not in . without waiting for any more , he replaces the reciever and walks to the door , where he picks up the mail . on his way back from the door , <person> emerges , ready to go to work . 
is this the suit ? 
no , sir , what ? 
do they have cable ? 
who are you ? maybe i 'll need to . you like me , huh ? 
<person> , you do n't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people . 
i beg your pardon ? 
we 're leaving . 
oh , c'mon ... first the picture of tammy , then <person> <person> , now this ? it 's scary . 
*no* ! 
why ? 
l.a. county sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in pico rivera . 
oh , i 'm fine , <person> . 
are you ... an architect ? 
it was her wrist . and it was through a plate-glass door . 
open up ! i know you 're in there ! 
<person> was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good ; coach said she could have been in the olympics -- but she was doing a routine , spinning , and the beam broke . 
let 's do that . 
just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond . come on , this is a joke ! <person> and battery ? i barely touched that bitch ! 
she made the best shepherd 's pie i ever tasted . 
shh . . . ! i 'll wait for you upstairs . 
hold it down , okay ? 
alas indeed , for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart . 
and he 's making them give <number> <number> of it to you all . 
what if i plead guilty ? 
we 're not going to make it . 
but you 're perfect for it . you 're young , you 're single , you 're successful ... 
i 'm calling the police . then i 'm leaving . you wait here for them . 
you remember . 
that 's all the more reason to forget about exorcism . 
thought you 'd never ask . <person> needs some gravy . 
that took guts . 
no . 
be very , very quiet ... 
turn-offs ? 
you should be careful . you could be killed if they found you out here . 
because i am a moral person . 
i 've got what i need for my report . there is ... there is <number> thing that bothers me though . 
can we phone them in , <person> ? 
sure we could run him . you realize he 's already head of his block association . 
there was a coffin ? 
how was america ? 
an original <person> <person> <person> of a red-breasted merganser . amazing . i have a copy of this in my office at home . 
i told you lay off . 
okay ? 
i really want to talk to you . i 've been thinking about what you said about moving in here ... 
yeah , but your running away is n't going to help you with all this ... 
actually i 've logged about <number> hours of simulated space walking at the institute , mostly related to starship construction . 
sure , <person> . no hard feelings . 
yes . 
i want you in dr. <person> 's office at <number> o'clock . you 're out of control , curran . 
of course not ! i 'm a wanderer ! i 'd like to go somewhere i 've never been ! 
i wish there were something more i could do to help you . 
underneath all the bullshit , just love . 
we 're going to have to explain away the ... 
who did you hear it from ? 
i did find it . it was inside of agatha all this time . so the question is , why would someone want this erased from the data file ? 
sh ! <person> ! 
i want what 's mine , half the money . we get rid of mickey , no one else dies . no one . say yes , i understand . 
<person> <person> 's got ta watch out , eh ? 
you could start with an apology . 
i thought we were on our way . 
<person> ? 
the question is not whether i am paranoid , but whether i am paranoid enough . you want to rub my neck ? 
what is so urgent ? 
no color , no sparkle -- but dependable . 
that 's what it says . you drank too much , you picked on me for being passive and timid . 
if they put this creeper in jail , then you 'd be safe . 
we set ? 
karen ... ... is n't it awful , i 'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you 've already done . 
no one yet , far as i can tell . it has gone intestate . 
it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me . 
that 's all we know about . most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center . a suck mark . these do n't . so , for him , biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior . you could try emergency room personnel , treatment for bite wounds . i know that 's pretty thin ... he bites a lot . 
the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of <person> <person> regarding the xerox form . it 's unsubstantiated and we ca n't accept a copy in preference to the original ... 
well , that 's ridiculous . if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order , just pick up a phone and pay for a call . 
here . finish the job . 
i just found out why all those tele- phone calls . it is not <person> desmond they want . it is the car they want to rent . 
was it funny ? 
i always wanted to try that . 
well , just take 't easy , man . 
the most important <number> . can you help me find him ? 
maybe it 's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions ... but you 're not a professional writer . 
what is it ? 
cadet , what 's your name ! 
good ... you up for a drive ? 
yes . seriously . 
maybe ? 
this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr. floyd . we should be given all the facts . 
i 'm a rosicrucian myself . 
should protect you a little , from the compression . if that thing gets ahold of you . 
that 's correct . 
it 's not our job to taxi drunks around . 
mmm . 
these ladies are n't starvin ' to death . they make minimum wage . when i worked for minimum wage , i was n't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy . 
she will if you think she should . 
know what this is ? 
do n't you < u > realize < /u > -- 
so now you 're going to tell me where i lost my eyes . you do n't think i know where i lost my eyes ? i was there when i lost them . i lost them in the war . the war in the joint . there 's always wars in the joint . cause i was a code talker in the joint and in the war too . <person> , nothing like the smell of a naked lady . be careful , boy . 
he wo n't make love to me anymore . 
uh-huh . 
this make of gun throws a shell backwards , high , and to the right . the chaise is only about <number> feet from the wall . 
calvin , i insist i be allowed to capture it ! 
and what are we looking for ? 
i like working for the bureau , sir . i like catching bad guys . it 's all i care about . 
why shucks , lt. anus , you told me to get the fuck out of here ... 
it 's lovely . 
<number> ? 
how 'bout yourself ? 
this the place ? 
that 's great . 
i 've never trusted him . and you know i got eyes ... 
now first of all , tell us your name . 
lady , you were going <number> miles an hour in a 45-mile zone . could i see your license , please ? 
i would n't presume . all the same , if it would n't be imposing , i would like you to see my new piece . it would be a tremendous honour for me . 
how do you figure that 's your bunk ? 
we used to have fun , she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos , but now she 's tired of it all . she never wants to leave the kids , she does n't need me , and they do n't need me , i feel like i 'm in the way . it gets complicated when you have kids ... that changes everything . 
okay . <person> , i have a headache , all right ? 
what a horrible death ! do you know what you remind me of ? 
i 'm unmarried . i 'm not available . 
what can i do for you ? 
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me ! what are you doing here ? 
maxine ... 
these are exciting times , <person> . we 're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs . look at edward jenner . he was n't content to bleed people with leeches , he pioneered a new frontier of thought 
everything in moderation , <person> . 
might i suggest tucking your pants into your socks ? to prevent mouse intrusion . 
what ? i do n't understand you . i do n't understand anything anymore . 
because they do n't like what i want . 
well , not me personally . 
you 're exactly right , <person> . i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm. and now i 'm counting on your assistance too . 
yes . 
hey , baby , that 's good ! how 'd we come out ? 
you sure you 're ok teddy ? you 're not bowling are you ? 
no kidding ! no fucking kidding ! 
i 'll call you . 
whatever you girls want . it 's on us tonight . <person> 's the limit . 
where ? 
mirrors , then . it 's done with mirrors . 
the websters . 
what does <person> think you should do ? 
no , really , i really like him a lot . 
al . <person> , you were my rock . i could n't have made it without you . 
and no ac . 
relax , <person> , i want you to go to the corner store . how much will it cost me ? 
by the way , i like the renoir . 
kinship . 
no , not my girl . self-control , she had . point of pride . and people do n't change , do they . 
what 's the assignment ? 
i 've never seen your place . 
i 'll fuck you up , you do n't hand it over . 
sir -- our shields are dropping ! 
` cause you know i can do other stuff . i mean , if you wanted me to talk or ... 
we thought it might be her husband . sometimes he comes and checks up on her . she told him i was down in florida . 
why ? 
you want my advice ? 
freak luck for sure . 
follow me close . gentlemen , gooday . a word with <number> of you ? 
which is guy-speak for ... 
of what ? 
i sell bmw 's . what do you do ? 
<person> did n't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene . 
yup . 
in a fight ? 
rock and roll , <person> . <person> <person> . 
then you 're only a hundred-forty- <number> in the hole . now why do n't you just take your visa express silver card , call <person> <person> and have him send you the money lickity split . 
any tips on where these guys may be ? 
stop kidding around . i 'm going to have to send my s.a.t . scores to san quentin instead of stanford . 
lost my eyes on okinawa . lost them fighting the war . fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me . 
did you talk to corey ? 
i do n't know . 
and ? 

give me a yell is something happens . 
i know the cruelty of such a fate . 
why ? is he staying ? 
well it took me longer than i thought it would take . it took like <number> minutes to talk her into it . but once it was on , we fucked for a good half an hour . i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in . it hurts the first time . 
when i get set , i 'll send for you . 
you do n't either . take a look at yourself . maybe you 're scared that someone might actually like you -- 
please , mom . people will talk . 
scarface , i have watched <person> . you want to know how to do a drug deal , you watch <person> ! 
his bride . <person> as a button . 
yeah , and you were -- 
i 'd want to set out events as they happened . the way i see it is this : the british <person> was an ideal . it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century , but it was n't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect , which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do . then there 's the essential -- 
thanks for giving me a ride . i just have a few stops , mostly on the west side -- 
we 're missing the sig ep party . 
i 'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
i want my fucking money . i 'm getting out of here . i do n't want anything more to do with you . 
only when you 're depressed . then it passes . 
okay , we 're square now , right ? 
let me go home . 
i have never seen a face like that before . it must be the look of great age . whoever he was he was terribly old . 
i 'm sure you 've seen this . perhaps you knew this man under another name ? 
that the word on our boy ? 
i had no thought of offending you , oona . 
yeah , but he 's my son . nothing strange about that . he 's my own flesh and blood . but here you got the same name as this man here , and you 're not even the same color . 
i ... i mean ... ... i ... it 's none of my business . 
i 'm calling it <number> . 
have you ever thrown up in the front row of a <person> <person> concert ? 
<person> -- do you mean to say -- do you think you can actually *handle* this -- this whatever-you-call-it in washington ? 
i did n't ask for a dog . 
that you , <person> ? 
been complaning of hallucinations . 
and that ’ s when he peed in his pants ? after the tart ? 
see <person> . he 's the money man . 
if we find <person> and he 's still alive , that son-of-a-bitch is gon na carry this goddamned b.a.r . back to the beach for me . 
oh , okay , forgive me . your neighbors are here , for fuck 's sake . 
yeah , everyone has to when they get hired . 
it better be up to and including me . 
the family paid the ransom and he was returned <number> days later . his father still has n't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass . 
i wanted to apologize . i ca n't live without you . 
always . 
yessir , his vehicle . <person> killed <person> 's deputy , took his car , killed someone on the highway , swapped for his car , and now here it is and he 's swapped again for god knows what . 
i do n't think so . i mean . actually , he robbed <person> 's house . 
are your pants off ? 
ha ! who told you about the stardust ballroom ? 
was your niece about their age ? 
i paid him $ <number> in cash for your psychiatric file . 
but ... 
intense . 
< u > no < /u > . 
experience , <person> . i 've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them . i 'm worried about you , that 's all . this woman -- she controls your destiny . 
they 're punks . <person> . their brains are wired wrong . they hurt surfing because they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . they just want to get radical . it 's mindless aggression . they 'll never get it , the spiritual side of it . 
well , outside of your regular fee , how much extra will it cost ? 
i guess that 's what i 'm doing , then . 
with the forty <number> dollars ? 
few suicide attempts , little inpatient stint . naturally , she misses her kids . <person> weekends a year and alternate <person> <person> seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all 's fair . <person> , she lives with a `` nurse , '' takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop . 
who died ? 
you hired <person> and rudy. , not me . 
yes , sir . 
you do n't need a picture . just look up handsome in the dictionary . 
<number> forty-two , sir . 
not as well as i 'd like . we 're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient . i 've had supply problems of every kind and ... what 's so funny ? 
you know french ? 
that 's tomorrow . 
huh . i guess they 'll tack on fifty years for me too . 
i know it 's hard but we need the exact words . 
they think it 's school-related ? 
<number> <person> ' ... 
you better ! yes ! 
what do you want me to say ? 
< u > so what are we doing < /u > ? 
on the dresser . 
you 're leaving . 
welt ... it depends , why ? 
we 're going to have to work on your touch . 
no . no . they never married . <person> 's had psychiatric problems . 
sybok . 
you call me with the target 's route , i follow along until we 've reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road . 
you mind me asking : why the fuck ? 
who knows ... we have to get used to living around here . maybe good help is hard to find . 
it was very strange . he called me at <number> this morning . <person> called me . i thought i was dreaming . i have n't heard that voice for so long . he told me who it was , then he said something like , 'meet me at apartment <number> at noon . i want you to go out for lunch with me . it 's time you furthered your education . ' then he laughed and hung up . i went back to sleep . he called me again at <number> to remind me to come . 
what if <person> tips off <person> <person> ? 
where 's <person> ? 
nothing . prices are a little steep here , are n't they ? 
if we squeeze him through , i 'm going to get him into <person> <person> . 
what about it ? would n't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love ? 
yes . 
<person> <person> can not give me exact figures , admiral . so i will ... make a < u > guess < /u > . 
she told us about <number> . the little sisters of the moonlight . in las vegas . 
all the suites are about the same . 
i talk to the guy you work for , emil . he tole me your number and where you live . see , i 'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you . 
i do n't know . 
this calls for a celebration . does n't it ? 
you greased the rails ! 
naw , you go first . 
i 'm only doing this to get out of my family 's hair ... . 
look , i do n't know what this ... 
she was fast , huh ? 
nothing . 
you 're not tired of it ? 
where did you get those from , a museum ? 
maybe not . but think about the sex . as frustrated as i am ... 
and what does this do to our bargain ? i can not afford the piano if you mean me to pay . 
waitaminute - 
it is you . this was taken in cairo at british headquarters - july <number> . and so was this - <person> <person> . and this -february <number> . 
no , philip , i do n't want you coming back here . and if you want to talk to me -- < u > call < /u > . 
the refridgerator . 
we 're driving out to the country tomorrow night . just the <number> of us . <person> , <person> , you and i ... 
<person> christ . can you kill it ? 
singer ! 
is he okay ? 
it 'll only take a second . 
i did n't ask if it would fit . i asked how much it was . 
those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision . 
oh , shit . 
we 'll be fine . 
can i trust you ? 
were you ? 
well , i 'm going to read it anyway . 
i suppose he was trying to make me feel bad . 
about a broomstick and a cigar box -- and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat . 
<person> police . 
my bike ! she 's a lesbian , too . she told me . 
meaning ? 
i 'm fine all over . 
i think <person> knows . 
exactly . 
<person> mr <person> 's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me . then , have <number> of your officers drive him home - i 'll see to the rest . 
now , the old lady starts to < u > weep < /u > , <person> <person> shrugs off his secret < u > service < /u > , goes to her , and covers her with his own coat . 
just not my type , i guess . 
m'hm . 
you played it pretty cool here , waiting for <number> days to call . 
well it 's pathetic , is n't it ? i mean to a guy from new york . 
death ! ! 
i never seen heat like this ! not even in las minas ! 
come on , that 's what you do . you handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload . you 're <number> times the size of the c.i.a .

that 's not true . 
any sign of rape ? 
look , everybody remembers your old man . being his son , all you had to do was breathe to graduate here . <person> <person> <person> <person> . but you blew us off . why should i take you back ? 
<person> 's mom said yes right away . 
more endearments . 
meyer just finished the books . 
well , sir , i 'm an excellent filer . 
oh , you want to stay now ? 
i do n't want to get up there . 
you know , i asked him about that . and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them . see , you 'd eat like a slob if you were alone , but since another human being is present , you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners . i did n't know that . i thought it was a way of appearing superior . know what else he told me ? 
you got it in a bar ? 
that 's not an answer . what is it you want ? 
excellent , ma'am , excellent . but perhaps if her majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity ... 
<person> said you 're amish . 
huh ! <person> ’ t you recall convincing me he had ? you should learn to live with your mistakes , mr lombard . there is some merit in it . 
can i help you ? 
yes , like a cave .

a lincoln ? what <person> ? <person> <person> ? <person> <person> <person> ... six ... ? 
is the program ready ? 
-- and who do you think he 's handling ? he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him . and for <number> years he 's been alone because of that . and if you try to push him into this , it 's going to be the same thing all over again . and i 'm not going to let that happen to him ! 
yeah , we do some of that . 
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red . 
oh , you 're wrong . he told me -- 
quod nomen mihi est ? 
i do n't . 
you do n't have to say anything . 
you did n't bring any chocolate , did you ? 
you do n't have to twist my arm . say now , that gumbo has quite a kick . 
it 's only ninety seconds up the line . you 're on a connection to a trans siberian express . 
i 'd feel better if we had some heat . 
i do n't know what to say . <person> , i -- i just - 
jackie , what 're you doing ? 
well then , you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe . 
who 'd ever thought that goofy <person> kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination ? just goes to show , you can never know about some people . am i right , <person> ? well , bless my soul . your eyes are as red as <number> cherries , <person> . do n't tell me we have another bleeding heart here . <person> , all these years i thought you were on my side .

but your voice have they dropped ? 
i do n't know it was stolen until i got here . 
what ? oh . i used to do gymnastics . are you looking for someone ? 
it 's a commercial area . no one lives there . 
but what about the past ? our past ?

i thought you blew all your money . 
nikita ? she helped me find you . 
you 're right about me . i am worthless . i am nothing . i do n't deserve to live .

oh . why ? does he live up here ? 
they have to clear all the local roads of mines . that 's a big job . they wo n't stay in the house . they 're putting up their tent in the garden .

i 'm sure they 'll have this place rigged . 
the preacher said it absolved us . 
she has the face of an angel ... she was an angel . she was so kind ... so kind to me . it 's not her fault , for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant . i 'm sure i must have been a great disappointment to her . 
calm down , frances . 
god , you drive me crazy . i just want you to know how i feel and you do n't understand . 
i do n't -- is that by the spanish <person> ?

how nice . 
yes , sir . 
that gun at lahor , <person> 's cannon - zamzammah - remember ? that was made out of the metal of ordinary things . i want to make an ordinary thing out of guns . his bayonet is thrust into the forge . it 's red hot . 
who 's the owner ? 
that 's a crock of shit .

if i tell you where <person> 's headed , you promise it 'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else ? 
and now i have `` dociled '' you , have i not ? by forcing your obedience . 
i 'd never ask you for money , you know that . i do n't even like talking about it - money , favors - i find it very awkward , it makes me very uncomfortable -

<person> swan . my brother . the other <number> are called <person> and leveau .

i thought -- i thought he was dead . 
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside . the queen 's house- . the gangster 's house- . the clown 's house- like that . 
none of your business . 
you know what i mean . i 'm getting married soon , but i have n't lived the life i want . 
i 'm afraid that would be a little awkward . it 's -- it 's completely without precedent . and there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances . 
that 's right , <person> <person> . 
hello ? 
let go of me ! 
you mean , again ? 
-- it 's getting older by the second . <person> <person> , if i could just please have -- 
i thought i was a widow . my husband ... the only man i ever loved ... is dead . for the rest of my life i have to live with that . 
<person> m. , i am running on my qualifications . i would never need to resort to , you know , to vandalism like a , you know ... plus , my own best banner was torn down . did i do that too ? 
curtis is always more complicated than he seems . even now . 
hey ! somebody 's coming ! 
yeah . so ? 
<person> christ , where 'd that come from ? i have a late lunch by myself and now i 'm fucking somebody ? 
but you 've got to listen to me . 
i do n't like him . 
in any case he 's asking you to come and stay with him . 
jesus . it 's slower than hell . 
by the way , i 'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so i can review it with admiral hanover . and do we have any of that breakfast tea around here ? 
why is he in your care , and not a proper prison ? 
you 're a wise guy -- gim me back -- 
i certainly did . i 'd finish it too , but ... i do n't get out much . 
you came back for me . 
you had some questions . 
like what , a porsche ? a ferrari ? 
and then some people you do n't like right off . it 's funny . you know why i want you to play ball with me ?

no ... it was eggs . i did eggs . 
well , that 's different . 
and thanks for the cloak invisible !

frank ! no , <person> ! <person> ! 
yeah , she 's okay . 
five-man job . <person> ' in and bustin ' out of a diamond wholesaler 's . 
listen , <person> -- it seems to me that there is n't a bar in here . i mean -- as far as i know . 
see the tape . then we can discuss reconciliation . <person> screwed up and i nailed his ass . now i 'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it . then i 'm getting on with my life . that 's all i 'm after . 
may i speak to you for a moment ? 
kirk ! <person> , you are still alive -- my old friend ... 
but you 've never figured out a way to win . 
i can get maybe another <number> or <number> feet out of it . 
was that like a homo-sexual remark ? 
never mind , you do n't want to know about it . 
you were merciless . you did n't give a shit if you got me or not . 
did n't ... ahhh ... look good . 
i often do . 
do n't tell me about what 's wrong . you come into my office as a friend and steal city files ! i could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody , that 's exactly what i 'm going to do -- and i 'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for ! you wo n't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy ! 
i do n't know . he could have told someone . he could have , like in the event of his death , somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried . 
she < u > was n't < /u > a witch . 
well , you boys do what you want . i just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday . 
not if she knew she would n't be believed . 
no thanks . i 'd like to break away -- 
well , i meant to let you go -- but , you know , you never miss the water till the well runs dry . 
i want to get in . 
i 'm sorry -- 
sure you could , in wildwood , new jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you would n't have much left over for decoration . 
all right boy : where 's the money ? 
they do n't care - just as long as you wear skirts . it 's like waving a red flat in front of a bull . 
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own ? that would have amused <person> . 
they should go <number> truck at a time . when the first truck gets through to the airport , then the others will follow . 
i never joke about waiving a client 's <person> <person> right to trial . 
c'mon , talk to me ! we can do it ! 
yeah , i 'm over here with him . 
never mind that , where are we now . 
they 're gon na let some local cop blow him away . 
you would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she 's the villain in the piece ... you are . 
mrs. teasdale , i 'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency . 
never touched me . 
to get on the board . yeah . how you goan'a get on the board sell'n a polack ? and i 'll tell you , i 'll tell you what else . you listening ? i 'll tell you what else : do n't ever try to sell an indian .

< u > you jerks < /u > ! that is my art , and it is < u > dangerous < /u > ! you think i want to die like that ? lydia . moving is a family affair . so buckle down now and go get <person> some drugs . 
do n't lie to me . you 're leaving me , i can see that . 
i am <person> . i am ... 
you 're a friend of the guy who killed her , are n't you ? you almost sound like him . 
you think he 's too old for me ? 
perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them . 
no , idealism is guilty , middle class bullshit . 
i wo n't light the cigars - how about that ? 
is this the first <number> ? 
that the matrix can not tell you who you are . 
are you at peace with your family ? 
they do n't actually lose 'em . you ca n't lose what you never got . 
it was the best time of his life . 
well , we ai n't never had <number> of them . where 'd you think that was gon na get you ? 
i get it . i 'm really pissed , <person> . you know the dea knows about <person> 's cay . for <person> , <person> worships <person> <person> and <person> <person> , that 's fucked up !

we want to dust him . we truly want to dust him bad . 
-- according to sources involved in the watergate investigation . beginning in the spring of <number> -- 
now everything 's fine . she 's probably squawking her head off in some police station . 
hey , that 's whacked ! i thought we was gettin ' on here ! 
and you certainly should n't settle for anything less that you deserve . 
phoebe ?

i thought you had something planned . 
no , we 're just going down . 
i beg your par -- -

'our revels now are ended . ' 
i know i am . why , i even heard a shot up there last night . 
what the hell do we know about seismographs ? 
ouch . come on , do n't bust my chops . i know it 's corny , but i do love it . 
just go to the beginning ! 
it does n't have to , it 's something that happens . it 's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds , there 's a kind of recognition . like you both know something . but then the next moment the person 's gone , and it 's too late to do anything about it , but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go , and you think , `` what if i had stopped and said something ? '' it might happen only a few times in your life . 
when ? 
how many cattle ? 
are you kiddin ' ? he loves you . 
you want us to get ourselves killed ? 
hello , <person> ! 
what 're you doing ? you 're doing something .

<person> meyers .

i do n't know . 
yes it is , cause then he 'll give you all a 's and it wo n't be fair . 
you like to play games , do n't you , <person> ? 
it 's too late ... 
i can ’ t tell you that yet . but he ’ s being well looked after . 
hell yes - walk . you 're meeting the president , are n't you ? 
`` it 's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels ... '' 
in a year , maybe <number> , i could teach him enough to -- 
please , let me explain . i 'll only take a moment of your time . 
i 'm not scaring you , am i <person> ? i hope i 'm not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , do n't you ? 
look , i appreciate what you 're offering , but no . he is my responsibility . 
ah , no , no . i did n't bang her . i know her from around here , that 's all . you want to meet her or what ? 
yeah . 
how do you know her hair 's black ? 
where would we find him ? 
pops ! 
you 're kidding . 
it 's like , you looked at my tape . you saw my picture . why did you call me in ? you knew i was twenty-four . 
do you remember the detonation time ? 
when ? approximately what year did this event take place ? 
it ’ s a snuff movie . prime paedophile material . i ’ m told it retails at around £4,000 . i see you don ’ t require a definition . 
it 's only <number> . 
that 's <number> , keep going ... 
the same reason everyone does . you hear your name on c-span and you realize you 're a skeleton in someone 's closet and they 're coming to bury you . 
<person> ' , son ... 
enjoy your last night ... ... where 's <person> ? 
no . it 's hard to l-a-u-g-h when your father 's dying . 
why am i alive ? 
just the same , you call the airport and let me hear you tell them . and remember , this gun 's pointed right at your heart . 
iris .

insolent young cub !

stop it . 
quite a collection . 
strategy . 
nice work , fellahs . good job . <person> ' out of the ground -- what a touch ! that was a stroke of genius . 
<person> treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party , that you were drunk and abusive . 
i was about to say he looked like shit , but hey , sure , he looked like you . 
employer ? the president ? 
you up ? 
okay . <person> . 
he did n't even lose a limb , an eyeball ... bladder control .. 
i 'm sorry to hear about that , sir . his face contorted in rage . 
huh ? ! 
huh ? ! oh , uh , no , i did n't get the job . but something < u > better < /u > happened ! 
i should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this . i apologize if i appear abrupt . i am rusty at social graces . how do you find <person> ? did you visit the pyramids ? 
you are like me , we refuse to be fools , to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men . i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over . that was my misfortune . that was your misfortune . i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was . i had no choice . 
<person> , if you want me to run your little camping trip , there are <number> conditions . first -- i 'm in charge , and when i 'm not around , <person> is . your job is to sign the checks , tell us we 're doing a good job , and open your case of scotch when we have a good day . second condition -- my fee . you can keep it . all i want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt <number> of the tyrannosaurs . a male . <person> only . why and how are my business . if you do n't like either of those conditions , you 're on your own . go ahead and set up your camp right here , or in a swamp , or in the middle of a rex nest , for all i care . but i 've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas . <person> ? 
butts on seats . that 's what movies are about . you got <number> job in hollywood -- everyone has the same job , in fact -- putting the butts on the seats . you got ta sell 'em popcorn and pepsi- cola . it 's all about popcorn and pepsi-cola . 
no problem , consider it done . i had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ? 
hey , <person> , you need a ride ? 
if you give him the chance , <person> will betray you like <person> . 
yeah . 
what do you care ? ever hear of rwanda ? 
well ... i was going to name you chief surgeon ... to consult on both shifts , yours and <person> 's .

i ... i do n't know . i do n't really think i should ... 
i am , <person> <person> . 
then there 's the other issue . 
sir , the cpu is on-line . 
there 's nothing to tell . 
this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street . 
i 'm telling you , it was possessed . 
this is insane . the hell with the money . you radio in for that chopper , understand !

you do n't say . 
yes ?

what about your wife ? 
i see . well , <person> wo n't get much further . they 'll catch him and ... put him away . <person> . he might very well have the truth . 
ready , pa ? 
we 're going to have to start the sequence again if you do n't stay with me , <person> . concentrate . 
look , <person> <person> . you have a drug problem , all right ? on top of that , you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected . we pumped you with antibiotics so you 'll be fine , but another day or <number> and you might have lost the foot . as for your spells . i 'm guessing they 're a result of the anxiety you 've been experiencing lately . 
daddy , why ca n't i ... ? 
yes , <person> . 
<person> <person> has set a trap for him and ... 
you know , the rape , to ... even to the accident ...

but it 's so far away ... 
oh yes -- yes . wo n't take a minute . can you keep a secret ? 
as you know ratings have never been our primary goal . i imagine we 'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing <person> 's latest torment . however , i 'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal . 
there are important papers from -- 
you look like <person> <person> . 
ah , doctors . what 's he gon na tell me ? ca n't trade my head in for a new <number> . 
`` checkers '' of course , hiss , <person> 's heart attack , venezuela , the kitchen debate , and <person> .

what was the mistake ? do you think it 's been rigged , all along the way , leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered ? they could n't have set us up better ; after all these months our credibility 's gone , you know what that means ? 
being rich is < u > not a trap < /u > . that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them .

that 's fine with me ... get it ? fine . a fine ! hey c'mon , c'mon , what is this , an audience or a jury ?

he 's who we want to go with . 
restaurant . let them know we 're running late . 
<person> was more a part of the big picture -- county political machine , chamber of commerce , zoning board if i kept those people happy , he was pretty much on my side . whenever somebody thought -- they start up another bar for the black folks , they 'd be -- how should i put this ? they 'd be officially discouraged . 
what kinda man lets a woman answer the door , this time a night ? 
christmas presents . 
where ? 
you do not want me to do your cover . 
you do ? 
i strongly suspect that <person> left the letters of transit with <person> <person> . i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly . 
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she 's in the state she 's in today . 
it bugs me . 
if you cooperate with the da - maybe they 'll help you with your situation . 
oh god , i ca n't believe this .

unless he was involved with <person> 's disappearance . 
just watching you . 
how about another <number> ? 
is the line sinking ? 
never mind . 
he does n't deserve your loyalty . more important , he 's not worth you making threats against us . 
yes , she is . 
oh . we might . yes . we can . let 's . 
yes ? 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
what 's the limit ? 
as a three-dollar bill .

<person> , i do n't know where you 've been since you abandoned my daughter <number> years ago , and i do n't care . it was good that you left , and i 'm glad you did . so what do you want to talk about ? you 've grown up a bit . maybe i had you figured wrong . 
i wish you had . i 'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader . 
you were once some kind of special forces . <person> <person> , maybe a navy seal . after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like <person> <person> or afghanistan , a real mercenary . only now -- now you 're like the rest of us , it 's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war . there 's a lot of hired guns out here , and not nearly enough work to go around . 
first i got ta get the part , then i 'll worry about that . 
you 're not carrying a bullwhip ... how 'd you manage to put my kids to work ? 
and how the hell are we going to do that ? 
you are in great danger . the <person> <person> can not fall into chinese hands . you must flee . 
marty ... 
the lifeline is divided that way . 
i thought about calling , but i want to wait until i know when i 'll be out . 
i ca n't help what i think . 
i 've got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ? 
the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . <person> only calls for <number> drinks per extra . fake the rest . 
mr greenleaf . 
sixty for small and seventy-five for large .

my husband . 
it hit ? 
<number> days ago , yes . 
you 're really nice . i 'm sorry i yelled at you before about it . god , i 'm an idiot . 
yeah -- that 's what we 've always thought -- but what if he was n't ? what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here ? 
no way . no fuckin ' way . 
hey , you and i are seein ' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin ' . 
-- do n't you miss the grand scheme too .

that 's pretty weird . is it possible for someone to not sleep for months ? 
maybe i do . 
hello ? 
she 's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers , <person> <person> . 
what baby ? what baby ? what baby are you speaking about ? 
so what 's unique ? 
<person> crawford must be very busy indeed if he 's recruiting help from the student body . busy hunting that new <number> , <person> <person> ... such a naughty boy ! did crawford send you to ask for my advice on him ? 
so what happened to you ? 
quite , absolutely - i always thought they were false . 
what 's he do ? 
<person> sulu , what is the crew complement of a bird of prey ? 
he 'll wander back when he 's sober and apologize . he always does . 
i 've told you a thousand facts . that 's all i do , <person> . i tell stories . 
<person> ? 
this dock is off-limits to civilians . 
tired of chasing squirrels around the park ? 
i 'm not worth it , <person> ! forget me !

or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity . 
nothing . 
i ’ m sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces . oh , and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcher-wootens . 
ah keeps the ol ' circle turning -- this ol ' clock needs plenty o ' care . time is money , <person> <person> , and money -- it drives that ol ' global economy and keeps big <person> <person> a-spinnin ' on 'roun ' . ya see , without that capital fo'mation -- 
i could n't work in the city . you see , i 've got my family in the country .

the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans , but i think they did it -- tex , <person> and <person> -- and your husband -- because he would n't go along with their scheme to steal the gold . i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him . i 'm trying to prove it . they think i 'm working with them . but i 'm not , and that 's the truth . i 'm on your side , reggie -- please believe that .

<number> years ago ? <person> . 
why do n't you ask the mosebacke ? <person> . until <number> years ago they ate with their hands , lived in huts , and did n't even know the rest of the world existed . <number> years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork . today , they do n't exist . 
spare me your notions of poetry , please . we all have our assigned duties and ... 
not gon na let me in ? 
they stop the construction work at <number> or <number> . the parking lot 's mostly clear by <number> or <number> in the morning . even the early geeks do n't get there before <number> .

do n't snap at me like that . you 're lucky i do n't punch you right in the face . 
birds ? 
aside from the fact that <person> 's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that is n't broken , things could n't be better . 
shut the fuck up or i 'll shut you up . 
you do n't have to . i told 'em you 're real careful . you never pick up money yourself . you always send someone , and i never know who it is .

i want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney ! he 's not just some dingbat i found on the strip . he 's a foreigner . i think he 's probably <person> . but it does n't matter , does it ? are you prejudiced ? 
did you send anyone out there ? 
i 'm not asking for names or specifics . i just want to know what prompted you to make the call ? 
what choice is there ? if <person> is in the bastille , then to the bastille we will go . 
you ... i 've seen you around the base . but you ... you 're not army , are you ?

delly ... thanks , thank you . i 'll take good care of this . 
commander , as i was saying ... in `` the quasar dilemma '' , you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override . but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix , so we were wondering where the error lies ? 
what ? ah yes . of course . i 'm sorry . it 's just that ... you 're my idol . and some people have been trying to keep us apart . 
what about him ? 
i know , but i 'm not as strong as i 'm supposed to be . i ca n't do it . i 'm screwing up the mission . 
you did ? 
this is n't working out . 
oh -- i did n't tell you ... i 've seen dr. corvisart , and he was very reassuring and encouraging . he has had excellent results with the waters of plombiers , and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there . apparently , he sent <person> <person> <person> there last year , and she gave birth to twins . 
is she not here ? 
i 'd love to see some more of your work ... <person> 's your studio ? 
i 'm not picking it up .

this girl is going to be a star . she just tells it like it is . 
the jig is up , <person> . i 've spent <number> months watching you , and know exactly what you 're up to . 
yeah . i guess -- sometimes -- senator <person> must be right . sometimes you -- you got to compromise a little -- and if you say so too , saunders -- if *you* think that 's the thing to do -- 
we see it . for the record , it reads `` <person> <person> . '' what 's the point of this ? 
what happened to your pants ? 
you are now a murderer , little <person> . a murderer , yes . 
this pizda ? never seen him before .

you 're from the same neighborhood . <person> <person> .

i 'm going with you . but we 'd better decide what we 're going to say and do when we walk in ... 
i 'll drop you off in a minute . i want to see if the baby 's up . you wan na come in ? 
yeah , like a church . church of the good hustler . 
we have to get to sonora . there are jobs waiting for us there . we 'll pay you for your trouble .

i have n't been back for ten years . is your family still there ? 
i just happened to be there . the right place at the right time .

i get why you 're angry . it 's no snap to explain why i was like that , but let 's not try to do it on the run ... 
do n't be pitiful . 
when served warm -- 
water ... <person> told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in spencer 's room ? 
yes ? 
take her down to the car , and for <person> 's sake be careful this time . last suspect he took in , butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs . what a mess . why is it we do n't appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?

it 'll be interesting to see how he manages . 
he took a shot . he 's unconscious . 
i dunno . nice breeze , wide open spaces -- you know , i 'm startin ' to enjoy myself out here . 
the union 's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now . 
<person> was a numidian . 
where was it parked ? 
ha ! where 's that ? 
and do you know why ? 
i believe it 's in my file , sir . 
the timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours , years of research will be lost . 
you should come into the shelter . 
uh-huh . 
i started thinking maybe it 's about the money so i call you , but all i get is the busy signal . i figure the phone is off the hook , that 's why i come rushing over here . 
if < u > he < /u > could overcome ... his need for ... for self- < u > ratification < /u > ...

yeah ? 
did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the diplomat with you ? you know ? 
hat was this morning . 
i 'm not stupid ! you ca n't get out of here fast enough , then you take back command ; you agree to wait on <person> , then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out -- 
sometimes ... once they 've been caught they feel a need for disclosure . they have so much they want to tell . but they 've never had a sympathetic ear . they need someone to understand why . stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully . it was part of the ritual . some were n't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean . but these last <number> ... they were still in water - always in water - but <person> , he was n't just careless . it went beyond that ... 
i 'm going to win this case ... mist ... <person> <person> ... i 'm going to the jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and i 'm going to win <number> <number> <number> dollars . 
did n't you now ? well then , answer me this riddle and all be forgiven . 
well -- i walked up to the front door . i was still alive . big surprise . i rang the doorbell , and old mrs. <person> answered . she had her goddamn knitting . i said , `` guess who ? '' she conked right out . 
no no , <person> <person> has actually been a great help – 
finish your breakfast ... 
you do ? 
... beating out the other papers , chasing girls ... 
materials . nothing more . 
yeah . what ? 
if you wake first , wake me up . 
help me with this <number> , i 'm really screwed up . 
i would if i could get some sleep . 
you 're what ? 
but not right away ? first the business of fighting them off , chin up , stout fella ... 
do n't look at me like that . auggie . it gives me the creeps . 
negro , what the hell you doing to my woman ? 
it 's because he desires you . the women get all the breaks at these conferences . 
there 's soft music -- 
the future , <person> <person> . the future . now where 's the girl ? ... i want the only daughter i have left ... as you found out , <person> was lost to me a long time ago .

home . 
i tell you <number> thing . ok , i 'll never be big enough to fight <person> , but i know <person> , i know ... 
it was n't <person> that broke in the room . 
hey , watch your mouth . do n't talk like that . she 's still my wife . 
at least i 'll have company when i die . ai n't that right , <person> ? 
if i had to guess , i 'd say the blackouts are stress related . 
what 's the hypo for then ? going to send me to sleep ? 
that does n't make any sense . 
you do n't know . 
are you out of your mind ? i still have nightmares , my reputation 's a joke , my leg is shot -- you think i need more of that ?

i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life . 
uh , i 'm <person> <person> . your new assistant . 
hey , buddy , that boat still runs , eh ?

why would n't i ? 
karen , in all the years of our friendship , i have never let you go to the ladies ' <person> alone . but now i must . i am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there ...

i 'm talkin ' about your potential . 
do n't panic . when security gets here , we simply explain what happened ... 
`` dear , you are a woman of super strength and beauty . a lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit ! '' damn ! <person> , i 'm sorry i ca n't remember all this . i 'm an old man . it 's too long . 
hello .

i keep thinking about him . 
why ? you 're not a real man ? 
but what happened to the little deer ? 
naw , he do n't do anything else with 'em , but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole . 
pretty soon i 'll be making a move . 
are you all right ? 
what you doin ' ? 
maybe if he 'd taken <number> of the males . but the female , she 's the key . she 's the one they listen to , the one with the most talent . the one who takes care of the other <number> . 
aye . 
what the fuck are you -- 
tavis , thank you for having me . 
that <number> 's probably married . think of his kids . his wife 's pregnant ... 
most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads . 
even the fall from the plane . 
the plot thickens . it appears that <person> has fallen for her music teacher . 
tomcats ? 
it 's so damn quiet out there . 
remember the first time we made love - and then -- - 
but you had so much *responsibility* . 
i did n't do anything wrong . 
listen to you ! ! you sound like mom . what are you talking about ? 
what was that , then ? 
he 's juiced in . he 's the county commissioner 's cousin . 
i need somebody respectable ... but not completely legit . what i 'm gon na do is n't very legal . 
last year <person> was in a.p . <person> . and <person> won the science fair . what are they doing in special needs ? 
you told me you 'd help me . i know this is n't what you meant , but ... i was desperate ... no money ... bum leg ... sleeping on the streets . i probably smell bad . sorry about that . but then i saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture . i can read , remember ? 
but it 's <person> 's money , not theirs . 
not < u > a building < /u > ! that 's the beauty of it . i think i can buy the < u > whole town < /u > . these people do n't know the value of their property ! 
like most editors , he really wants to be a writer , but he 's too busy living a novel to bother writing <number> . 
you do n't believe it was a car accident . 
well , you 've just been taken off the bench . 
i thought she was with you . 
uh ... yes . apparently i did , air . 
that 's not our intent -- 
jesus ... 
but we must respect that power , we must be in awe of it . 
he 's alright . he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july . 
i warned you , <person> . 
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you . 
yeah . 
oh -- you do n't have to go to <person> <person> while i 'm around . 
do you every think for <number> second that you might have some responsibility for what you 're doing ? ! for cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie ? ! 
i do n't want to know . 
fuck it 's the cops . <person> saw me , now i have to let him in . 
he 's not in . but he 's working on it . he said to tell you . 
<person> <person> <person> . 
the empire considers this a matter of internal security . we regret you 've become involved . 
wait a minute you need <number> . 
lem me take you home . 
santos , why in hell do you insist on playin ' this stupid game ? 
where are you going ? ! 
he does it right in front of him . 
very well . if you insist on details . i have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb . good day , sir . you will forgive me for receiving you like this ? 
you 're out in the desert , the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles , and you say the time was n't right ? what 's the matter ? you were hoping to get it on home video ? a keepsake for the grandkids . <person> <person> i waited , or i never would have gotten it on tape . 
< u > what < /u > ! 
we assaulted a federal agent . we killed him . 
jesus ... 
what thought is that ? 
well -- did she really like me or were you just making that up . 
so , have you and vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet ? 
i want to make you happy , <person> ! i 'm going to tell you a story . once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm . <person> , <number> of the guards , saw the king 's daughter : she was the loveliest of all ! and he immediately fell in love with her . but what could a poor soldier do compared with a king 's daughter ? ! ... <number> day he managed to meet her and told her he could n't live without her . the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier 'if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony , then in the end i 'll be yours . ' <person> , the soldier ran off there and waited ! <number> day , <number> days , ten , twenty ... every night she looked out of her window , but he never budged . come rain , wind , snow , never budged ! the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive ! after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he could n't hold them back . he did n't even have the strength to sleep any more . the princess kept watch ... and on the ninety-ninth night , the soldier got up , picked up his chair and left ! 
yeah ... 
<person> ' ... you want to go for a drive ? 
of course , <person> . 
<person> , please . i hope i 've been informative . long day-a bit scattered . 
yeah , you know everything ! ! 
any sign of the hostages ? 
why <person> ? he of all people should have cheated death ! 
he ran a great risk , helping us today . if he opposes his fate , his death will be terribly painful . 
where is she ? 
black-eyed sczortarska . 
you tell me . 
sometimes it seems to me time stopped <number> years ago . there was this war , there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die . but he did n't . is n't that amusing ? 
who cares ? let 's just go ... what 's stopping us ? 
then what 's the story , what 's this `` strange '' bullshit all of a sudden ? is he drowning puppies , or what ? 
yes . 
i 've been thinking , <person> , about <person> . i was going to ask if she 'd come with me sometime to meet dr. woolens . 
pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher . 
okay . do n't worry about it . it 's okay .

never mind . it does n't matter ... if i 'm worth a damn , i 'll pick the right direction . and if i 'm not , well , i do n't care . see what i mean ? 
let 's blow , <person> . 
hardly farmers . i 've done some checking . all these were in the war . these men know sabotage , tactics , and have <number> years of bloody fighting experience behind them . they are disciplined , well-trained and have a charismatic leader . if i were to design the perfect outlaw band , this gang is what i would create .

why do you hate us so much ? 
oh , just a personal project like anyone else 's personal project . <person> 's just a little more personal . 
that 's what i told you then . only he did n't . <person> killed him . 
<person> christ . 
he 's my favorite . 
you 'll be alone .

sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it ! 
<person> 's back on our side , so let 's get smokin ' . 
do you believe she really saw them ? 
it is a favor , is n't it ? 
as far as they know , that 's absolutely true . 
if you were in his shoes would you take <number> of us home ? 
well , i am a dead man and buggered to boot . my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks , my company is playing the inn-yards of england , while <person> and the chamberlain 's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece , written for my theatre , by my writer , at my risk when you were green and grateful - 
we need a lot like him -- his kind of character -- ideals . 
you sure you do n't wan na ... ? for old time 's sake . if you do n't trust me , you can tie me up . 
<person> sid , over there is the stab <number> production offices . that 's where <person> <person> was murdered last night . 
now , i 'm gon na make all these caramels disappear . 
there you go trying to make sense again . it 's a curse . handed down through countless generations . as ageless as this celebration which you call <person> . 
kay -- 
the empire state in fog means something , do n't it ? do you know , or do n't you ? what is your number , cabbie ? 
give me your hand and we both live . 
well you might as well say it . <person> small time ... 
guess . 
what 's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me . 
so ? 
pitiful rookerful ... 
you think i should take lessons ? 
take me there . 
that will take time . 
i got suspended when i was young , too . i was pretty cocky in my day . 
ahm , well , you know ~ that 's a tough question - on <number> ' level i think it ... . 
no . 
what did you say ? 
where ? ! 
i 'm telling you , baby , you always double down on an eleven . 
maybe i should wait ... 
i guess you could say we 're entopologists of a sort . 
are , uh - - are we certain that you want the gamin ' control board eyeballin ' your record and your gangster pals like <person> <person> ? 
lovejoy sits behind the wheel , watching the bar across the street , getting his video camera ready for action ... what 's he doing ? following a guy ? 
we 're going to be moving , son . 
you want a chaser ? 
get out of here ! 
the same as the firs <number> . definitely a serial . 
what ? 
his face . 
i guess i have what you 'd call a love-hate relationship with <person> . 
well , where is it ? i- 
do you really believe me ? 
you told <person> on the phone , he told me . so where do i fit in ? 
i 'm not nervous .

j.m . inc. be all that someone else can be . 
what kind of straight pool game you like ?

okay to proceed . 
i 'll drop it !

if you 'd read about it first , you 'd have no problems . 
thank you , quince . 
gim me a kiss . 
and he says you 're gon na wan na hear what he 's got to say . * 
kill type ? 
my folks are . 
i think we should refer to 'it ' as 'him . ' 
god . i ca n't believe it . 
maybe <person> went to get some books to study up with . he 's gon na be a radio expert , ya know . maybe he figgered to suprise us . 
you watch the draft this year ? 'course you did n't , idiot question . they try to make it dramatic , like there 's some big surprise who picks who in the first round ? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months . <person> 's reports , highlight reels , coaches ' evaluations , psychological profiles -- hell , i would n't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys , have 'em analyzed . all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad . compared to that , what you know about the person you get married to do n't amount to diddly , does it ? 
because i remind you of her ? 
pretty , is n't it ? 
you wo n't get off that cheap . 
i arranged for him to have a phone . i have to call him in a few minutes . 
then where is she -- in the ice box ? 
nothing . 
take all the time you like , doctor . 
missed it . can i get a fifth of old crow ? 
that guy 's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that . 
ca n't leave me now . 
'in the still ... still of the ni-ight ... i held you ... held you so ti-ight ' ... take it , man ... 
... .with a woman 's touch . 
but the- i 'm not discussing politics or economics . this is foreskin . 
<person> but i have to get at least <number> fight out of you otherwise i wo n't even get back the cost of the bribe i had to pay the arena slaves to get you here . i know what you 're trying to do : kill yourself and trust in the roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands . the only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you 're a very important individual . you make me feel good about my investment ! and that puking pig jerses -- he wo n't even discuss you . both of you have clamped mouths ! but i love all my fighters -- i 'll find out about your family . and about you . that i promise . 
you 're looking pretty chipper this morning . 
black coat , possibly leather . <person> slacks . <person> t-shirt . he says they 're gon na try and corral the guests on the street over there , and then check them out , but ... 
no . 
where are you going ? 
i guess part of us never really leaves high school . 
you 've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone . that 's not our betty ... 
but -- 
to prevent a murder . <person> or later , he 's going to contact you . 
those blue things ate everybody here ? 
i have no solution for its meaning yet , but i could not just ignore it . 
go on to the house . 
i 'll need an office on the grounds ; someplace to store my things . 
u-huh . 
like it ? 
perhaps not as much as you might imagine . when tutors answered every question except those about who i was . when i was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been , i knew there was something different about me . but a king ... 
you might think -- i thought so myself at first -- that <person> 's too insignificant to be dangerous . but that 's the very reason to beware ! it 's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character . 
jesse . what are you thinking ? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county ! 
i want to leave right now . 
we got time off for good behavior . 
yes . yes , it 's all terrible ironic and amusing . you fuck . now how are you gon na get us into that room ? 
what is it , norman ? 
-- you listen to me . nobody , nobody , talks about my friends that way . you 're fucking here right now because of the kennedys . they may be wrong . they make mistakes . but they 're not weak . the weak ones are these 'people ' who ca n't speak their own minds . 
they 're real goddamn good . they 'll be there for when ya need 'em . where are they ? 
he went home sick . 
shoot . 
excuse me ? ? ? 
beth -- 
any particular reason ? 
you 're not going ! you have to stay with us ! 
the blood transfusion continues . <person> has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp , so that he can see <person> in bright light , while he himself sits in the dark . <person> watches <person> 's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death . <person> slowly seems to return to her , and her breathing becomes more peaceful . she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her , but she is much too enfeebled to speak , and closes her eyes again . <person> keeps a close watch on nikolas , who grows paler and paler . his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to <person> again . 
it was turned on . i was ignoring you . what 's the big emergency ? 
well , maybe i -- 
yeah , follow us . 
<person> <person> <person> . 
ai n't that a sad truth . <person> <person> ? 
i must really be slacking off . <person> ? 
what are you doing here ? 
what 's next walt ? 
no , i 'm gon na quit ! 
you 're around every afternoon ? 
i 'm sorry <person> canned you . 
it 's a guy in a cage . 
noooo . free snort . that 's it . 
you mentioned on the phone that you 'd had some dizziness . 
no . 
who 's `` they '' ? 
i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand . 
no , but we 're making excellent time . 
which is ? 
thank you ... 
how do you like flying ? 
and i take this < u > opportunity < /u > to suggest that , equally , i admit to < u > nothing < /u > , and that i would like my lawyer present . 
i did n't know it was a hit . i swear to you i did n't know . <person> <person> contacted me in beverly hills -- said he wanted to talk . he said you and <person> were in on some big deal , and there was a place for me in it if i could help them out . they said you were being tough on the negotiation , and if they had a little bit of help , they could close it fast and it would be good for you . 
but he sure can kiss . 
because you have to pay . it 's like a parking meter : if you stay , you pay . it 's the rule ... 
let me tell you something , doctor . <person> love a guy with a bad rap . they say they do n't , but they do n't mean it . they all think that they 're the ones that are going to `` save me . '' the trick is to let them think it 's true . 
hi , ted . 
mmmm -- hurts a little . 
does that include <person> <person> , united states congresswoman ? 
who will it be ? put your mind to it , then . 
you 're gon na be okay . 
what is that <number> over there called ? 
do n't tell me `` no . '' i saw you lookin ' at him . why , you like him ? 
good idea , ted . 
tell me the truth . am i a female fog bank ? 
it 's a little late for me . 
i knew what he wanted , and i did n't want any part of it . 
yes . 
well how do < u > i < /u > know what they 're -- 
calendar for the day . you 'll find the senate manual in the drawer . anything else you want , just snap for a page . 
there is nothing in that statement the president ca n't explain . 
forget it . 
i know . <person> ... i 've always known . 
case ... 
the d.a . gave me immunity . 
not that i 'm going to be much good after last night ... 
who is he ? 
do not put this on <person> 's tab . start a new <number> . 
well ... 
you would n't . 
it is serious , mrs. ramos . 
we 'll talk about that . <number> o'clock gives you time to go to bank . <number> hundred <number> dollars . 
oh yeah no i do n't want to do that . 
i can wait around if you want . 
s'only got to hold for another few days . 
annabelle pick up the phone . 
i 've been living in it for over a year , the camper is mine . 
what ? 
thanks . 
do you mind ... 
no i did n't say that . 
so you decided to help him after all ? 
that 's why <person> wanted you to stay . it 's better than squeezing into my room , and i know how you hate hotels . 
<person> ’ t go , <person> ... 
is that all ? 
she thinks that money 's in the river , but you and me , we know better , do n't we , boy ? 
i think playing in a band called `` bitch '' might put a dent in the whole `` perfect family '' thing . 
on what ? 
joely ... 

yeah . she 's so little , so pretty , and innocent . 
i like to know who 's living in my house . i like to know what my boys are up to . 
i changed my life today . what did you do ? 
are you going out with <person> tonight ? 
<person> schwimmer . i memorized every word of this review . 
you already did . 
<person> ' , ma'am . 
what are they saying ? 
you know this guy ? 
perhaps i should rephrase the question . what i mean to say is , are you married or seriously involved with a significant other ? 
they 're not my pals -- 
too bad it did n't happen to <person> <person> . 
that word again ! i do n't even know what it means ... 
but that 's what i need . to be sure ... to be absolutely sure ... 
mighty nice little town , <person> . they 've got the state capitol there , you know . 
this information goes back <number> days . i want the standard file , you know that . 
not just that . take your time . use it . live it . 
we ai n't one-at-a-timin ' here , we mass communicatin ' ! 
<person> to interrupt you , mr brett , but i have a message for you . 
you know , when you rewrite a script , it just gets better and better ! 
he does n't seem to be listening ... 
ssh , it 's me . i 'm calling from the deathbed of my mother . 
are you calling her ? 
your mother tells you this ? ... agnes your mother is dead . 
you were great the other night . 
she 's in the elevator heading toward <person> . 
no idea at all ? 
but no <number> actually saw him die . 
what is it ? a disneyland thing ? 
that 's disgusting ! 
uh-huh . 
sir , i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels ... 
easy to purchase , hard to detect . too much potassium can kill a man . just have to ... pick a discreet spot . 
get a hot mug of chocolate . first thing i 'm gon na do . 
i did n't say that . all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out . 
i bet <person> told him where to put it . 
no news yet ? 
you 're crazy . do n't let him , <person> . 
no . i want to show you . is it ruined ? 
they are here ! ... your jewels ! ... here in paris ! 
that 's all right , really – 
this is incredible . i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you . i mean , you do n't have an answering service , right ? 
oh really ? where you from ? 
he wrote a great <number> on burgundy , and i used to get his newsletter , but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting . plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century , and they turned out to be turkeys . <person> never retracted . 
find her you dipshit ! 
you do n't believe in god anymore . 
i wanted to ask you something , on account you 've been around so long . 
let me finish , dear . you had your say , now let me have mine ... 
nine thirty

we 're a few minutes away . just sit tight , stay outta the house till we get there , understand ? 
where have you < u > been < /u > ? what happened to your wallet ? 
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb . 
no ! 
wow . you <number> really have something going , do n't you ? 
well , it 's about how people have <number> personalities . the side they show to the world , and then the secret person they hide inside . 
what ? 
i was a victim of circumstance . 
i told you goodbye . why are you here ? 
come on ! 
uh huh , great . then those fat fucks in washington figure , what the hell , let a computer run the whole show , right ?

<number> miles ! minefields over there . do you know where this campground is or not ? 
<person> <person> 's ... you 're warped . you know that ? you 're really warped ! 
sleep well ? 
i need to tell you something . i did n't know what it was to lose somebody , to see death and find how much it scares you . that you have n't lived and loved enough . i did n't understand . <number> me . 
i 'm engaged . 
you idiot ! you do n't even know what you 're fighting over ! 
you do n't know , do you ? you 're blissfully ignorant , are n't you ? 
mmmm , no . not a good idea . 
... this must be boring you . 
a-and you owe me ... 
she brought my digestive enzymes . 
we need your help . 
damn right , i have . you think i like living on fucking <person> ? we do a good job on this , we 're in . 
where are you going ? 
ah . <person> . and you know <person> ? 
... .now that i 've met you ... . would you object to never seeing me again ? 
if she calms down , i will let her in the house . 
that 's where this chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas . i could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me . 
it 's damn lucky you did n't have the dossier on cable here . 
you 're a very beautiful girl . 
yeah -- well , i 'm sorry i 'm tying up <person> , i did n't realize you <number> would be going this late . <person> . 
we 're fucked , i know -- 
you look exactly the same . 
the room ’ s yours for <number> hours . it ’ s sound- proofed , stocked up with food , drink and other things you might find useful . you can do anything you like . 
lois is n't here ? 
then why ca n't i go in there ? 
these antidote filters the professor 's whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday , as arachtoidal creatures . they wo n't be pretty , nothing personal , <person> <person> . but just remember ... if we fail tonight , there 's no tomorrow . 
this is my project . i say 'action . ' i am the director ! you are the talent . you wait for me to say 'action . ' and 'action ! ' 
... just like that ? 
fine . and a couple of bottles of <person> <person> . to cabana <number> . 
it 's <number> idea ... 
that 's the way it is . 
<person> gave you ten thumbs . 
she 's alright , nels , thanks for asking . 
i see . 
look , trust me . i know what i 'm doing . 
you sure ? 
you do n't really think so ?

yah , but that trucoat - 
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices . you do n't have a choice . 
do what ? oh , i see . 
no , you do n't understand . <number> daughter- 
what 'd he steal ? 
on what ? 
the oak where <person> sprained her ankle . 
not that <number> ! 
be careful . 
i want someone who was in the o.r . we 're going to win the case , there 's no question of that . it 's just a matter of how big ... 
i bet you could do a book . 
i should have told everything right away . i know that now , and i regret it . 
an answer , i hope : exactly what -- or who -- <person> was taping . 
so , then , you 're , like , available ? 
before he can get there here comes this federal <person> , and franky 's indicted for jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he 's gon na be disbarred , his life is over . <person> , gim me another drink . how are you ? 
you must be wrong , <person> <person> , 'cause he 's been marvelous about the <person> <person> <person> . 
why ? 
oh , yes . and *i'm* helping . <person> -- and i 'm helping . so we knock this off in record-breaking time of -- let 's say <number> or <number> days -- 
bullshit ! 
yes , <person> . 
i do n't think we should leave her alone . 
we think there 's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside <number> of the buildings within the sequestered area . 
sid , i 'll seeya tonight . 
how do i know you 'll keep your word ? 
because is not democrash ? all peoples created equal ? 
he -- he said if i did n't give the money , he 'll kill me . 
ohio ... 
`` do n't write any checks you ca n't cash . '' 
geoff , this is crazy . <person> did n't die . 
the ship is sailing wihout us ! 
he 's going back to the front this evening . i ca n't see him otherwise . 
well , i just thought -- oh , look at me . you 'd think i 'd never had a house guest before . would you like something to drink ? 
patch me through to the bomb squad . 
and there 's <person> ... 
the stay-puft marshmallow man ! he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid . we used to roast stay-puft marshmallows at camp waconda ! 
yeah , but ... 
yes ? 
no , it 's <number> <number> dollars . 
yes . 
i was in love once , <person> . she had a hold on my heart . i could barely function . i *was* a great swordsman ! i was knighted ! i could have been king ! 
meet me at the other location . 
... if it happens , it happens . if it does n't , it does n't . do you understand what i 'm saying ? you never know what 's going to happen next , and the moment you think you know , that 's the moment you do n't know a goddamn thing . that 's what we call a paradox . are you following me ? 
did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip ? 
there . 
it 's the end . 
that 's right . 
well that 's good . 
you 're kidding . 
i just have a feeling . where are you ? 
so , what do you do ? 
forget i asked . 
you do n't smoke . 
i did n't say i thought we should have saved him.. 
i think <person> suspects anybody he does n't intimidate . and people , who are good at what they do ? they have egos , too ... 
it 's your move , <person> . 
grady , it 's <person> . <person> <person> you 're there . you wo n't believe what 's happened . 
okay . 
he killed his father and then my family ... 
i fear not , mrs. kendal . even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly ... as is his pain . 
no ! 
prude . 
i mean i 'm a fucking fraud . i 'm no architect . do n't be a putz -- who 's been to santiago twice in a year ? <person> <person> -- please ! 
can you put me in the ring with him ? 
i want to know what in hell you 're doing . 
<person> 's not a killer . he 's a pervert . he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack -off parties he has with his <number> best friends . 
laplante ! that asshole ! i do n't ... hey , is that you , from the tee vee ? in person ? 
the western woods . 
<number> dollars . a little more . 
no , i do n't think you 're like , `` i 'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do n't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you '' . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery . 
huh huh . 
`` buy and walk '' ? `` buy and bust '' ? `` reverse undercover '' ? what ? 
he was drunk that night . he left his coat at your house , after your mother seduced him ... 
stop it . 
i realize this is a shock . 
and making you feel bad at the same time , huh ? but that 's the way i am , you know , the way i 've always been . <person> picking on poor little roy . 
you know , a <number> and <number> years ago you 'd have been scalped for that remark about native americans . right here where your house is -- you 'd have been scalped . 
your grammy ! 
oh , westley , darling . <person> , why wo n't you hold me ? 
i 've stopped a hundred times . 
you all right , <person> ?

i 'm afraid that 's not true . will you want me to stay on till monday ? 
you ca n't believe you 've lost her ! <person> or later , you 'll find her , and you 'll look in each other 's eyes , and you 'll see all that love ... 
<person> . 
a major prick . 
not me , sonny . i 'm just going to sit around and listen . what 's this ?

get outta here ! 
those <person> wo n't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes . 
well , w-what happened ? 
he tries to act tough , but there 's a look in his eyes that ... . 
then why have i become a man like you ? 
struck out eighteen ... 
spike ! 
got a letter from this goodridge guy ? says , you 're upsetting his students ? 
has n't she had enough ? 
then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread ? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna ? 
this stuff is so sticky . 
aw , gee . i sent her on an errand . 
dr. lecter , you find out everything . you could n't have talked with this `` <person> <person> '' , even once , and come out knowing so little about him ... you made him up , did n't you ?

<person> < u > and < /u > the space program have come a long way , sweetheart . but after the wedding , no more complicated computers for my little girl . 
chancellor . we 've been ordered to escort you through federation space to your meeting place on earth . 
yeah ... i 'm out .

here 's <person> <person> and the demilitarized zone . get it ? they 're korean , so they 're pretty hot . 
i know he messed up , but that does n't change what he 's been to you . 
i do n't know . i 'm not sure . he said there are people who want to lose , who are always looking for an excuse to lose . 
at this rate , the infection should be complete in <number> , maybe <number> weeks --

dr. thompson . from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy-six . 
oh , do n't do this ! 
<person> 's file . read it . you 're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who 's made threats on her mother 's life and a female lover she 'd never identify . 
i think i 'm mixed up in something . 
if your issues are with me ... this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation . 
yes . there is nothing more frustrating , nothing that makes a physician feel more useless , than standing by watching his patient deteriorate . and when that patient is a friend , no ... no , there 's absolutely nothing i can do . 
it means , <person> , you have n't closed a good one in a month , none of my business , you want to push me to answer you . and so you have n't got a contract to get stolen or so forth . 
i was in love <number> time but she said i was n't financially reliable enough . and she needed that . 
this is <person> <person> ... what 's going on down there ? we 're taking plasma ! we have <person> p-11 as clear !

how 'd you know that ? kay ? 
you ! the girl from the volcano ! kryptonite ... 
i really do n't mean to be discourteous . but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england ?

i heard you the first time . we had nothing to go on with this kid . just a runaway . do you really think he 's in danger ? 
i ...

in english , <person> . we 're in the united states -- 
no , i 'm afraid that part is n't true . <person> was in awe of me and tracked me down . we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field , but he was hardly my lover . besides , i always travel alone . 
well , technically , i have more of a right to be there than you . you still have your balls . 
he was a little older . looked like the marlboro man . 
while i was seeing dr. paley i mentioned to him <number> night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary . <number> days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs .

do you miss having someone to talk to , <person> ? 
jimmy , there are people here i need to speak to . you 'll be fine on your own ?

i think you 're full of shit . 
shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him , will you ? 
oh , yeah , yeah . <person> , um , how do you figure that ?

your husband says you said `` there are <number> ... '' right before you got cut off .

sir , my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity . he has not taken that <person> <person> as it was his right to do , and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing , counsel advised him to do . so , i think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record . 
how do you know that ? 
you think he 'd of shot us ? 
that was no earthquake . 
i was the warden ?

i did n't guess until it was too late . 
eve ... why do n't you start at the beginning ? 
mac , did you ever find out who molly went off with ? 
maybe you should go out with him . if you keep avoiding him he 'll get suspicious . besides , what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who 's investigating you . 
what 's the code ? 
your train ? <person> , friend , you 're obviously lost . ... i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime . 
during an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin , <person> <person> , the minister of armaments , said to me , 'you look very tired dr. furtwängler , you should go abroad for a while . ' i knew exactly what he meant .

what 'd he think it was to you ? 
back in '37 , you heard <person> <person> play for the first time , so you went out and got a used clarinet . you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him . you tried hard , but it was n't long before it was clear that <person> <person> would never be looking over his shoulder . so you gave the clarinet to spencer . 
yah . 
lem me fix you a drink . 
yeh , and what if we play tomorrow and he does n't come up with the money . we risk our whole operation for nothing . i 'll say when we make our bets . 
we do n't have to do this . i 'm a daytrader . i could just go home . 
there were <number> charges , they were supposed to go off simultaneously . the second <number> , the one that did n't go off , was down here ... first of all , this is nothing , it 's a sub-line for the breaker above . second , why put the charge all the way down here ? if you 're good enough to get in here and handle the gear , you 're good enough to know you do n't need this . <person> would know .

we 're taking the other case . 
you think of everything , do n't you ? 
do you ever perform out here ? i 'd love to see you .

there is `` undercover . '' and there is `` which way is up ? '' 
i live alone . 
why wo n't you tell me your name ? 
and give you a good buzz . 
the door was opened , so i just came right in . 
this way . 
that 's what i 'm here for -- to get out ! i want to get away from here , from you -- as fast as i can and as far as a <number> <number> francs will take me . sixty-five , ninety-four -- 
you ca n't fucking say something like that and say you do n't want to talk about it !

well . he does n't think it 's god , but for different reasons than me . he 's thinking : if i can figure out how to make it stop , than i am smarter than it is , and therefore it can not be god . 
he will be hurryin ' and he will miss . that there is as fast as i can pull an ' aim an ' hit anythin ' more'n ten feet away ... unless it 's a barn . 
come on , chief , you think about it , the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we 're more like clergy than cops .

was that about the right angle ? 
leaving ? 
space for what ? to o.d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it is n't . correct ? 
i < u > ca n't < /u > call an exterminator . i ca n't afford <number> . god , i ca n't even afford my < u > phone < /u > . i got fired .

do you have any children with anyone ? 
thanks for your help on the glasses thing .

where is the austrian ? is friedman the austrian ? 
you 're drunk , boy . i 'm not gon na bet ya any more . 
we 'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you 'd be pleased to know there 's quite a lot of interest in this role . 
i 'm sorry , i thought you were somebody else . 
this can not be . everyone knows the queen mother is a recluse , and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king ! 
the germans go into jewish homes and they just take what they want , furniture , valuables , anything . 
are you afraid ? 
the bastards outconned us .

why ? 
what do you want me to do ? 
apparently it 's huge . 
... ... ... .. it 's a bomb is n't it ? 

when 's the latest time you were out there ? 
delusions of grandeur . 
do n't tell me you did it on my account ! hope you 're not getting any idea that what happened last night is— you need n't concern yourself about me , young man . i can take care of myself . 
what ? 
they know where i live , i guess they know what i drive , so maybe we should pick up another car on the way . 
what about her ? you did n't ask her out , you 're such a pussy -- 
i should go . i should leave today . 
is that me ? 
i 'm doing great . you ready ? 
it makes me weepy just to remember it . so we were fine again , and then she got married to <person> who 's a womaniser and a bit of a yob , but quite nice really , makes tv commercials . what about yours . 
where is <person> <person> ? 
no . and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which i believe you 're beginning to experience : guilt . 
well , it 's a little too early . i 'd say thursday would be good . i 'll know by then . is that all right ? 
all of you ! 
this gentleman or myself ? 
do you think this is wise , boy ? crossing blades with a pirate ? 
ooops . 
an interstellar vox . 
hey , whatsa matter with a bank account , anyway ? 
and they never proved anything against him . 
what happened ? 
i 'm not ... i 'm not ... you 're gettin ' a bus ... you 're gettin ' a bus ... the jet 's comin ' into <person> ... and your wife 's on the way ... what else do you need ? what else can i get you ? listen , i do n't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the fbi guy ... 
what do ay say ? 
so what ? ! so fucking what ? use your head , violet . the money is gone . <person> is coming here to get it . you think he 's going to believe me if i tell him his piss-hole son stole it ! is that what you think ? i do n't . you know what i think ? i think i 'm a dead man . i 'm <number> in the brain . that 's what i think ! 
that 's because we want a chance to observe them . this is the only place we 've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them . what happens here will be a guide to all other operations . the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops , i 'll get my report to washington . you 've deployed your forces well . 
out of here . 
tell me he 's living in squalor . tell me everything he has is being repossessed , including his filthy , dented mobile home . 
you are ? 
oh , i do n't mean that . i 'm sure i 'm going to need your help . 
i do n't know how far you 'll have to travel to find supplies , but if you ca n't get home by nightfall , i want you to look for something called a holiday inn . write that down . it 's a hotel . there might still be <number> standing . 
shit no , it 'll be twice cost . 
i know what i said but not now . you won it . <person> . you won it . when they give you the money , that means that you won . we do n't want to go to court -- is this getting to you ... ? you know who the attorney is for the archdiocese , <person> <person> . 
she looks like a lot of other boats . i grant you she 's beautiful . 
what time is it ? oh god ! do you always type your letters ? that should be <number> ts . 
what you say your name was ? 
what makes you think something 's wrong with her ? 
grant -- wait a minute -- you 're not going to dismantle the wireless ? 
it would appear we are too heavy . 
i ca n't bring the bureau into this . if i do the tapes become evidence . 
he 'll kill us . 
got a match ? 
what 's your accomplishment . 
we should sleep in shifts . 
i 'm ignoring you . 
sir , there 's something else ... a transat relay . <person> came through . 
i ca n't go out like this . 
<person> i 'm late ... 
there are a thousand things ... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch ? is this a punishment ? are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell ? and how long is this going to < u > last < /u > ? 
i 'm ... i 'm , uh , i 'm <person> <person> . 
for as long as i can remember . 
the odds are <number> <number> to <number> so all we need is <number> grand . 
i found her in bed with someone . 
and the way you search your prisoners , it does sound rather unlikely . 
no , you 're right . or buddy . i wo n't ask if he 's with you or what you 're doing here in detroit . or if you 've run into <person> <person> yet . 
captain , if your mother saw you do that , she 'd be very upset ! 
french-fried potaters . 
i did n't see her ... and i did n't hear from her ! believe that ! 
and did you fantasize that <person> was photographing all these sex acts ? as though they were traffic accidents ? 
every time i tell you that i love you , you flinch . but that 's your problem . 
you misunderstood . this man suffered a severe fall , if you take my meaning . he 's my patient now and i must do what ... 
thass ' right . i got other brother 's though , so it ai n't so bad . 
are you a bad boy ? 
please do n't . 
who do i have to blow to get out of here ? 
for a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin ... 
i was just kidding . 
hello , sheriff .

and sound . 
my brother blacksmiths ! 
hi , <person> <person> .

<person> , twenty-eight bucks is nothing . the only way to do it is through your uncle ... think about it will you ? 
scotch and plain water , i think .

we do n't know . it 's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand ... 
who you calling ? 
<person> . 
but swords are today impossible ; <person> <person> is -- is lame . he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night , as he was riding home , and can scarce move it now .

what ? 
yeah . yeah , sure . i 'll see if i can find him . hold on ... yeah , <person> 's looking for you ... 
good . stay in that frame of mind . 
maybe . but you 're also curious about the man . twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him . you were concerned , but you did n't want to show it . 
i 'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine . 
it was an unfair fight . he did n't have a chance . i 'm taking a real gamble . i loved him for a long , long time . 
no sir , the hotel is full because of the diving championship . 
goals are important . 
if you 're scared it scares the hunger out of you . 
be nice , sweetie . we 're just here to help you . 
thank you . <person> , that feels good . 
i know . and that 's great . but it would be great in a better way , not a better way but a different way , if i could find him and bring him back .

we 'd rather not --

your government needs your help . 
yeah , wizard , i guess . i mean do what you think is right . 
why ? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me ? i wo n't get shocked . i 'm used to this ! my father was a true pig . he fucked the bitch i 'd as mother all around the apartment . whenever a door was closed , you could be sure they were making sex behind it ! and my sister , if you did n't sleep with her , you 're building 's exception ! 
why did n't i ? 
say it . 
it was just there . 
yes sir . 
i do . 
jabez ... 
wait -- wait -- you ca n't go anywhere -- i got ta go with you -- 
dean rusk ! 
we 're going to win this .

but you know i never killed nobody that did n't deserve it . 
i 'm sorry , <person> . 
scotty -- what 's left ? 
did n't she have any physical examinations in this time ? 
never heard of him ...

you read it off your fucking photo . you do n't know me , you do n't even know who you are . 
what is she doing < u > now < /u > ? < u > <person> < /u > < u > of < /u > < u > god < /u > . 
you are late -- the dancer 's gone to the theatre . 
'cuz we do n't need to draw any more shit down on our heads . we hit whoever 's between us and israel . i do n't want to dead the whole floor and i do n't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living . 
no , it 's not . it 's for this . 
why did they built it ? 
luther did n't tell me you had a big mouth . 
no . you know what ? you guys go ahead and bring back something here . yeah . 
oddly enough , i do . 
then i found out hopalong cassidy had shot himself in the game room . that just blew it for me . 
that 's mr . <person> <person> to you , you back-stabbin ' murderer ! 
michael ... . 
now , let 's say the whole country . was in that car . the entire united states of america . 
you did this ? to yourself ? 
thank you , sir , most kind ... 
well ... come what may ... <person> <person> , <person> <person> . 
your aunt ? 
blood sample ? how close did you get to that thing ? 
i want to work this . 
do not misunderstand me . i do not hold your frivolity against you . as basic material you might not be bad , but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture . i feel sorry for you . 
a room ... there is a room , and i sit there alone ... always alone ... 
her name is <person> <person> . i saw her talking to gordon . she must have stolen his keys , altered the signal- 
vegas has been my town for <number> years . i crawled out from under the first rock . do you really think you can intimidate me here ? 
another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ? 
go get a soda out of the fridge . 
your slave ? 
-- i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia ? -- 
sometimes . 
... when you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or <number> ? do something they did n't know they were capable of ? 
and do n't limit poetry to the word . <person> can be found in a work of art , music , a photograph , in the way a meal is prepared -- anything with the stuff of revelation in it . it can exist in the most everyday things but it must never , never be ordinary by all means , write about the sky or a girl 's smile but when you do , let your poetry conjure up salvation day , doomsday , any day , i do n't care , as long as it enlightens us , thrills us and -- if it 's inspired -- makes us feel a bit immortal . 
wow . 
karla ! 
could you reach <person> <person> by car radio ? 
what did you think , they come clear up from kansas to fuck us ? 
that is my concern . i 'm involved in something just now . i want to finish it in waldman 's memory . 
frank would open you . 
he wo n't give it to me . 
no , sir . 
arnold ! 
so you want to go swimming ? 
i 'll tell you where he is . he 's walking around this ship , killing anything that moves . 
let 's not talk about that . how 'd you get home ? 
you 're a fucking moron . 
the more he thrashes , the better . 
yum , yum . 
i 'm not coming back ! that 's it ! i want to go home ! 
what is it ? 
he did something with the ground . 
my wife was weeping before she fell asleep , outside my window i saw my caporegimes to the house , and it is midnight . so , consigliere of mine , i think you should tell your don what everyone knows . 
no i would n't . but i 'd try to persuade him to turn himself in . 
you 're impossible ... . 
no , that wo n't do any good . 
you know how old i am . 
you 're sure your men did n't move this ? 
my son <person> , he was married when he was nineteen years old . <person> matter with you ? 
it was a long time ago ... i met someone at this place called <person> 's ... we became friends . he told me about a job ... 
gold . you were going to— 
shut it up ! shut the little bastard up ! 
she said `` none the better , you all go to hell ... '' 
is leslie here ? 
i 'm glad somebody finally cried . every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death , i want to cry . i do n't cry , of course . not manly , you know . did she try antihistamines ? 
<number> is not <person> . 
hint . it 's not a geographical location . 
why did n't i build in orlando ? 
maybe he 's leaving his wife . i do n't know , and i do n't care . lots of people have saws , knives and ropes around their houses . lots of men do n't speak to their wives all day . lots of wives nag , and men hate them , and trouble starts -- but very , very , very few of them end up in murder -- if that 's what you 're thinking . 
wait a minute , <person> . i 've been waitin ' <number> years for that . i do n't think it 's fair , man . what about the merit system. ? you were gonnna give me a few thousand . 
julie , i 'll tell you something that is the god 's honest truth . i 've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do . 
i did n't shoot west ... 
virge , you 're makin ' the arrest . you make contact , i 'll back you up . <person> 'll back me up , <person> 'll keep an eye out for trouble . and keep your hands on your guns . they even look like they 're gon na <person> something , buffalo 'em . right over the head . 
i 'll know soon enough . 
not even a joey , i 'm glad to see you ? <person> , what happened to your leg ? 
just keep leading the way . 
if you do anything to my friend ... 
<person> <number> , captain ; officers ' quarters ... ! 
you 're late . 
well ? 
i 'll miss you , too , <person> . 
i hate loving her . i hate the kind of her person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays . i hate letting her use me . but i love her too much to do otherwise . and i certainly love her too much to kill her . i could n't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy . 
i 've already modified a tricorder with <number> of his spare actuation servos . its operational range is only <number> meters but it should shut him down ... 
casy ! what you doin ' here ? 
upham and <person> , what were they like ? 
we just do it ... we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do , i guess ... 
i 'm sure you 've probably heard that i want to ask you , but i 'd like to know if you 'd go to prom with me . i know we did n't hit it off right at the beginning but- 
you 're a fool ! 
is that your idea of arithmetic ? 
i did not -- 
<person> ! <person> , stranger . what in the world are you doin ' here ? 
what kind of a question is that ? 
snoring . <number> , <number> guys . mumbling ... vietnamese . somebody talking in his sleep . a toilet flushing . 
<person> killed her . 
try <number> in a <number> ! 
i guess you did n't kill nobody then . 
here . 
when i was young , i read < u > <person> < /u > and i could not believe how much grendel records and how little of it my idiot father <person> <person> <person> got . 
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping <person> , or could be in little pieces on <person> <person> beach . any idea what <person> 's going to do next ? 
uh ... i think you scared them off . 
right . well , thanks . for the lift . 
that 's right . and tech firms ... they 'tend to scare people off . 
do you owe markers ? 
that 's a good question . 
she 's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg . oh , <person> ... please do n't let it be a dick . 
no , i ’ m serious ... you ’ re really stunning ... 
yes , he knew . just.. 
what do herbs have to do with it ? i do n't understand the -- 
why did you go and do that ? he was all ready to go <person> <person> ! 
what happened to your neck ? 
without peer ? 
i 'm impressed . you 're a killer . 
you broke in my house and i have a witness to it . 
of course i 'm seducing you for <person> , and i 'm doing a damn poor job of it -- are n't i pretty ? 
he -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty . 
there goes eve . eve evil , <person> <person> <person> . but the evil that men do - how does it go , groom ? something about the good they leave behind - i played it once in rep in wilkes barre ... 
not on station time . 
i have to ! 
seventeen meters . 
no . he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer , and then his family moved away . to cleveland , actually . 
is that what you 're thinking about ? 
i 'm sorry , sis , for leaving you guys -- 
do n't you think that 's a lot of garbage ? i 'd really like to know where it 's all going to go . 
i 'm sorry , i just ... 
we need to talk . 
<person> said you do n't even have plumbing over there . 
welcome to ya . what 's your name ? 
you ca n't go in there ! 
<person> gave me this ? 
not the other way around ... ? 
thanks . 
for harold . when <person> comes home , we can have some birthday cake . 
i 'm glad you do . 
i 'd love to stay here and chat , but i 'm right at the end and i got ta find out what happens . 
you do n't understand , sir , we ca n't get the bomb to drop . 
where are we going ? 
what expenses ? 
you can be <person> <person> . 
so you see , everything is in order , is it not ? 
what ? 
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ? 
yes . 
<person> . <person> got a little , you know , enthusiastic . 
the only place i do n't bring my drugs is church . and that ai n't till sunday morning . 
i 'm right ? 
gone . destroyed . 
how far away is she ? 
position ? 
yeah , but -- 
no -- 
nice first impression . a nose bleed in front of your parents . 
you think this was to hurt you ? ! my god , <person> . it is n't about you . 
it 's me . <person> . 
not with my acrophobia , midge . if i dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up , it could be disastrous ! 
the only thing is i 'm staying at the athletic club -- and it 's strictly stag so if you do n't mind -- 
i have to . 
i 'll go down the line , <person> , believe me . 
sure . him i liked , he was a very nice person . secretive too , traveled all over , but a decent man . 
so that 's why we ca n't get along ? because i 'd rather shoot a `` dumb '' jump shot ? 
i think that 's what it says on my driver 's license . 
where the fuck is that bitch ? 
ca n't you at least call the camp and make sure everything 's all right ? 
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit , and those who refuse to quit i will kill . you ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir , yes , sir ! 
noooo ... . 
you should call your grandmother . 
is that the decoder ? 
how does he know so much about me ? 
how many ? 
you ! 
what are the heads ? 
why did we begin this ? 
it 's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and does n't have to take any time outs . 
what 's wrong honey . 
it should n't last . gives me time to take a go-go juice break . 
... to him . 
sure . 
mozart - 
was there something else ? 
okay - got light duty , <number> days . 
i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year . people say it has something to do with the ozone layer . what do you think ? 
a cemetery ? 
you 've done a helluva lot more than most people . 
and ... your friend ? 
subject ? 
it 's too late . <person> injected it . 
it 's a fucking shame . 
and he was ripped limb from limb ? 
what about the rest of the inspection , admiral ? 
am i wrong ! 
will you take a check ? 
where is luh ? 
your sister - - have you heard from her lately ? 
yeah but <person> , even you do n't believe all that `` i 'm ok. you 're ok '' stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself . i 've been all ears for about <number> years now on his subject , and -- 
there is no invasion ... 
<number> hours . 
did you see anyone else down here ? 
i 've seen every frame of your work . you 're the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision . you and me , art and science ... we are the perfect marriage . 
that 's absurd . 
i 'm sorry . 
carlos , i never raped a woman . 
i know what this is . <person> , you in ? 
uhh , miss devoto ... 
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game . do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer ? 
feeling the paranoia tonight , are we ? 
i ca n't leave now . we taking sean out ? 
well , <person> , who were you ? 
... such a pleasant sound . 
do n't ever talk like that , fran ! do n't make yourself out to be cheap . 
heather ? 
my god , we tried to save her ... you ca n't know ... you ca n't know ... 
that 's the whole works , right up to date . 
gee , <person> , i 'm sure glad you stopped by for me . i needed to talk to you . what 's it they say about blood , it's— 
i know , you investigated . maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself . 
<person> <number> -- 
folks ai n't talkin ' about much else . they say they got posses out . <person> ' about a lynchin ' -- when they catch the fella . 
stop touching his brain ! 
so , <person> , why do n't we start with you . why are you here ? 
but i want to paint you . you appeal to me more . 
i understand . but again , in all honesty i was not informed . 
why are you doing this ? 
i said that 's <number> to you , holliday . in or out ? 
it is n't a man . 
where 's the car ? 
where ? here ? 
you 've been acting so strangely since you returned . i'm—i 'm worried . i have n't bothered to ask you any questions—i— is n't all this what you wanted ? you have n't changed your mind about king , have you ? 
i know i should n't have , but there it was , just sort of lying out , and i could n't resist and -- and -- i suck . 
she figured it out . i 'm sorry if that upsets you . 
and what ? 
you 're <person> 's calculator , archie . all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal , you got to know something . maybe they told you , maybe you overheard things you were n't supposed to hear ... 
i do n't think this is the lightning you are looking for . <person> 's a good man . i know i did n't seem to be completely in his corner before , but i 've come to appreciate -- 
whatta you think ? 
<person> ? 
here ? what a joke . there was some detective asking about that girl . 
oh , it 's fine . <person> . 
we were married . then she was taken by the slayers . you must help me . 
we ca n't do this alone . we 've got to get help . 
please , go ahead . 
hello ... <person> , hi ... oh no ! ... oh god ! 
so you 're still that little boy looking for shooting stars . 
well , we should talk . you going to have time for dinner ? i 'd like you to meet <person> . 
it 's a good thing the school was flooded today . 
want to give my flower a drink . 
i got caught robbing a synagogue . lots of good stuff in them holy places ; churches , temples , mosques , and who 's guarding them ? 
<person> cook . 
he 's out . 
good morning . 
you did ... where ? 
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far , but the numbers are all over the place . 
do you want me to see what 's on them ? 
do n't worry , we 've got everything . 
and this ? ! good lord , have you lost your mind ? <person> ca n't say this . `` niggers '' ! 
some kind of signaling . 
i still do n't see why we have to have separate rooms . you expect your father to come through ? 
you know , i did n't want to bring this up , but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect . even your own wife . 
he always have that shit-eating grin ? 
no doubt you 've heard the rumors . 
time for < u > your < /u > lesson , <person> . <person> <number> : what happens when you < u > supercool < /u > hot metal ... ? ben ... 
knox , i do n't believe this ! 
would you remove your hat please ? 
yeah . 
<person> 's in a jam i tell you . the run 's getting worse . 
you 're home .

you liked the guy , though . 
dream on , auggie . she 'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday . 
<person> –– zuzu . my little gingersnap ! how do you feel ? 
what did he look like ? 
you young'uns worry about weapons , i 'm thinkin ' bout strategy . 
where 'd twombley get shot ? 
where 's snow ? did you call him ? 
i hear you 've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl . 
it 's over on the tv . all it says is : `` dear clarence . '' i could n't write anymore . i did n't not want to ever see you again . in fact , it 's stupid not to ever see you again . las night ... i do n't know ... i felt ... i had n't had that much fun since <person> <person> . so i just said , `` <person> , come clean , let him know what 's what , and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to drexl and fuck yourself . '' 
this time i 'm really glad you showed up . 
she 'll be with her friends over at stu maker 's tonight . 
i have already rented the apartment to another family . 
well done . <person> girl . you 've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before , am i right ? 
oh , well . i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite . when he comes out , you tell him i 'll be back . he has n't gotten rid of me ! 
i 'd like to try again . if you 're game . 
any time , bro . 
that 's a reasonable possibility . 
can you set that up ? 
i 'll do what i can . it 's getting messy in there . 
this book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon . 
how much time do we have ? 
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine ? violent ? 
yes , the rain has been very heavy . 
what ? 
pretty good .

at church ? 
okay , just calm down . he could hurt us , brother . he could ruin the whole thing . 
i insist . 
i swear i 'll never swear again in my life if you save her life ! but i 'm warning you , if you let her die , then you 're the biggest ... 
that you come with me tonight . once . to the opera . 
<person> ? 
wonder if you could smoke shit out of this ? 
oh , yes , i 'm fine , thanks , just fine . 
bapu , for me , and the rest , if that is what you want , we will accept it . but out there already there is rioting because hindus fear you are going to give too much away . 
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox . i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game . my wife is from boston . <person> <person> ? 
what ? i thought you were free to come and go as you please .

what ’ s that ? a word ? 
you tol me you wuunt ask me again til i 'm ready ... .

and what was that neighbor guy doing here ? 
-- a philandering pig . 
how come i 'm still in black and white ?

maybe we lost them . 
how 'bout you , <person> . 
... brazen-it-through ...

you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll , is that right ? are you a racist ? 
where are we going , <person> ? are we going home ? 
what 's wrong ? 
you may laugh . <person> and champagne may mean nothing to you , but to me -- they mean a great deal . you see , i 'm ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life . i do n't want to miss life -- do you understand ? 
what did i tell you ? what did i tell you ? buy the road map and leave . 
well which of those <number> ya want fixed ? 
and you 've never seen anything like that ? 
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh . 
how could you let me find out like this ? 
aye . he 's enchanted the lot of them . his reward for delivering the unicorn . 
yes , it 's a miracle . 
i 'm trying to save you years of frustration ... waiting for a big break ... no . waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me . 
look daddy ! it 's empty ! 
what difference does it make ... ? 
maybe i should take a few days off . <person> 's working now , you could use some help around here ... 
ottawa ! 
if we decided on making him a new york type , could you do that ? 
it 's exactly what you meant . 
you would have the court believe that these <number> bullets were fired from the same gun ? 
get with it . get over it . ... millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on <number> in a blink ... that 's us . lost in space . the universe does n't care . the cop , you , me ? who notices ? 
you do n't hold a thruster down ! it 's for quick boosts 
sonny ... ? 
son-of-a-bitch . you 're some piece of work , are n't you ? 
i never asked if he could `` see . '' i just asked <number> or <number> of the stud- ents if they remembered anything ? 
give us your money . 
you like <person> ? 
well , my horses are feeding , as you may observe , mr coghill . it 'll take a little while . 
yes , you lost your control . 
spock ... what have you done to my friends ? 
what happened ? 
well , naturally . of course . 
plan ? what are you talking about ? 
there you go , blaming yourself for everything again .

what about easier to hit in an air raid ? 
male , <number> to <number> years old , five-foot- eleven , chewed tobacco -- then we get into the dental records -- 
how many you see ? 
no - the police say i 've killed fourteen - but i 've not - i 've killed many more . it amazes me how they just have n't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just do n't get missed . i agree , some of them are well hidden - i probably could n't even show you where i put them - <number> girl , number <number> i think the press called it - she was n't even mine - i do n't know who did it but i did n't 
what if we were to put <person> into the park as a guest ? 
i guess so . 
the tents were sent ahead , they should already be set-up . 
i thought we all had separate rooms . 
what ? 
to straighten something out with you . right here . right now . 
call <person> ! 
not a clue . i did n't lose the ship . next , your new personal communicator . picture-phone , fax , beeper .

you 're hot ! 
be quiet , you fat fool . ca n't you see i 'm praying ? 
we do n't know which <person> , do we ? 
i apologize for the surprise , but the days only opened yesterday and i figured ... 
whatever you want . 
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ... 
how many bullets ? 
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- 
i am not -- i just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do ... 
what ? what are you doing ? 
it is fish . 
i want you all to come to amity this summer . 
are you kidding ? the golden globe , the edward r. murrow award ... 
i 'll see you burn . i 'll see you dead -- get away from me ! ! 
lucy ; come back ! 
practically no one . 
i know . i know . they 'll say anything . 
they 're kissing again , do we have to hear the kissing part ? 
and what happens when you lose ? 
it 's no big deal , she just gave you the wrong keys that 's s ... 
you used his credit card . 
same kind of crap -- 
there 's still time to undo this . 
he exceeded his orders . his travel permit was promptly revoked . 
i think it 's gon na be a waste of time .

no . i have n't noticed because i make my payments . so , <person> <person> , how 's the p.i . business ? 
<person> president , we are in a revolutionary situation . we are under siege -- black panthers , weathermen ; the state department under rogers is leaking like a sieve . and now this insignificant little shit ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy .

in a fire ? never . <person> , i 'm his brother . i care about him , y'know ? he was going to get himself killed . maybe not today , maybe not in a year , but it would 've happened . and i could n't -- i just could n't ... 
you did n't hire me . she did . if she wants me off the job , i want to hear it from her . 
<number> ... ?

san juan ! you must know my good friend <person> <person> <person> <person> <person> . 
i tried to tell you <person> ... that night in paris ... when i first came to you ... no-one can refuse the dark gift , <person> ... not even you .

because they enjoy it . 
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed , it would have been me .

him : 'do you mind if i come in for a nightcap , <person> ? ' her : 'well -- it is awfully late . ' him : <number> <number> , all right ? ' her : 'promise you 'll behave yourself . ' him : 'sorry , baby , i never make promises i ca n't keep . ' 
did you ever go out with someone and just ... .lie ... .question after question , maybe you 're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever , or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie , but maybe you just do n't say everything -- 
these are private -- these are for us . 
never felt better . 
i wo n't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper ... ... by candlelight , i suppose , in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap , erotic minds ! 
... a monstrosity ! who would do that ? 
norbert was just beginning practice . a real man would have sold her to a catfood company , i suppose . as far as that goes , <person> <person> <person> still lives with his mother . 
that 's right -- i 'm at last going out on a date with the great <person> and i just want to be sure i 've picked the right t-shirt .

if you do n't mind my saying , you seem mighty familiar with your house boy . 
why ? 
alright . here we go . let 's go niggers ! let 's go niggers ! 
what do you suggest ? 
what about you ? 
... what was that back there ? 
i think <person> is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually . you should see all the books he has . he must read constantly . 
come on , you know the words , sing along . 
nervous ? scared ? worried you 're not fit for a caper of epic proportions ? 
<person> dead ... you know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she 's trying to break my trust . how do you like that ? i ca n't touch it until she 's dead and she wo n't give me a dime and now she 's trying to break it to pay you ... 
status report , admiral ! 
eddie , where are we ? we passed that carwash twenty minutes ago .

yeah . all a colored woman wants is your money . 
i thought so . 
oh , <person> , come on . 
yes , of course , i would . you know i am not <number> of your wife 's greatest admirers , but i certainly know nothing about this . 
simply preposterous . do you know what i did last night ? last night , <person> <person> , i held a sort of a self- inventory . i said to myself last night , <person> <person> , i said , `` lovey '' — <person> <person> ! `` <person> <person> , '' i said , `` you are an ungrateful fool . . . `` 
it 's true ! 
shh ! 
whom are you calling -- in the dead of night ? 
okay . <person> . everyone knows <person> 's worth a boat-load of greenbacks . from aviation , freeway construction . but the man has hobbies , too . he bankrolls b movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers . and try this on : he 's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer . all in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o . 
oh , well , that 's just it . she 's been coming down here , every half hour or so , to , sort of , check on me . if i 'm not here , she might ... call the police or ... something .

so you wan na git bit , huh ?

i 'm getting out of here , man . i 'm not going to stay here and i 'm not giving up . i mean , huh , they 're going to kill me , anyway . so fuck it ! but , if i can get out of this ... i am going to get out . and , how i 'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and i 'm flying the fuck out ... that 's all , <person> . if you want to come with me , then you 're entitled ... you can come . you 're free to do what you want . 
so , you still picking apart cockroaches ? 
i see . 
what for ? 
<person> ! <number> years ago you got <person> pregnant ; you then proceeded to cheat on her ! you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back ! and then , just a few weeks ago , you told her you were unhappy with her and were `` kind of looking around for somebody else ! '' 
i think it 's cool . 
stu , are you ... feeling okay ? 
i do n't want to die . 
i 'll be delighted . 
rose , that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again .

you have only to stretch out your hand , take up the glass and drink a little . 
whatcha mean by that ? 
what 's a'matter ? 
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies . to the tree of the dead . maybe we passed it by . 
i do n't like nobody behind my back ! 
how do we seem to you ? do you think us beautiful , magical , our white skin , our fierce eyes ? drink , you ask me ! have you any idea of the thing you will become ? 
like st. jude . a hopeless case that has a complete block about 'c ' minor . but remember , `` whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves . '' new testament , <person> <person> . 
just ... images , really . feelings . 
what business ? 
they 're burning all the canadian stuff cause of the war . 
you know all that “ if these walls could talk ” stuff ? do you believe it ? that a place has a memory ? 
i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo . 
brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you . 
about <number> degrees off your star- board bow , take a heading leeward of sand island , and lay her north by northeast ... . 
gotcha . no need to get anatomically correct with me , <person> .

is n't it true ? 
if you promise not to snap my head off , i 'd like to thank you . 
maybe it 's crazy , but it 's better than having <person> dead . 
yes . i hated her for coming between my mother and father . she kept me from seeing my father . i went down there to ask her where he was . she would n't tell me , and i shot her . 
come on then .

why do you hurt me , <person> ? i 've always been loyal to you . 
just like proper english gentlemen . i 'm proud of them . 
no we did n't . he died on his own . 
... i guess i 've been all wet . 
hey man , i was in love once . i got hurt really bad . i never wan na go through that again . 
fire moat ... why do that ? 
she 's crying . 
good reflexes . 
well you 're not getting , either . 
no , i told you . a whiff of perfume on his shirt . 
pike and i got separated -- 
where are you <number> going ? 
i 'll take it ! 
i like your outfit . you got the fifty grand and the plane ticket ? 
guys . we 're doing it right , here . $ <number> prime rib ? nobody does that in michigan . nobody . 
a sweater . 
i did n't mean it nothin ' dirty . 
it 's a stunt . humans do n't write . 
maybe . but this is n't about living or dying . it 's about good versus evil , and we 're good , whether we like it or not ... maybe we look a little funny ... 
do n't tell me that . i do n't want to know that . 
oh , no . the fan club is real . but they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros . 
no . i want to buy a dog . 
whoa ! ! i 'm so glad we got that on tape ! ! you wo n't answer a question about <person> , but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life ! ! <person> , what do you think she 's going to make of all these videotapes ? are you going to tell her about them ? i ca n't imagine her being too understanding about that . but since you do n't lie anymore , you 'll have to say something . 
what ? 
what was that about ? 
make them go faster , mr ... . ? 
i wanted to get this out of the way . 
last question . you 're watching an old movie . it shows a banquet in progress , the guests are enjoying raw oysters . 
she did n't cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket . 
yes , you did . 
that you , <person> , honey ? 
any luck raising ackland 's party ? 
<person> , there 's something that 's been on my mind and i have to tell you about it . 
-- the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word : courage . 
nothing , just a jolt of deja-vu . i think i went out with a guy with a dignified british butler -- ca n't remember how it turned out.. 
yes . 
pain bad , ho-jon ? 
i was just about to go to the door , when that man did my job for me . was it alright ? 
yes . you 're going to new york . 
... position ... 
cash and what ? 
well , nice to see you now . 
your own brother ? you could n't send someone else to do it ? 
mrs. foster -- send a memo to bartholomew at security recommending that -- 
kill , kill , kill , kill , hah , hah , hah , hah ... 
huh ? 
so they 're airing this tonight ? 
and your gun . 
we just got a gold record . 
mr <person> is being very typical to this point . 
something wrong with that ? 
<person> , is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first ? 
but i 'm not . i 'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could n't possibly understand . 
you on drugs ? huh ? 
that 's the key to the city of pasadena , which <person> <person> was given <number> years ago in recognition of his various civic , uh . 
so you do n't want to hear my new ending ? 
poor question . too wordy . a good question gets right to the point . <person> , where 's my chest ? 
... that 's what the swing is < u > there < /u > for ... thats its < u > purpose < /u > , < u > is n't < /u > it ... 
i know what 'cha thinking . i thought the same thing . but it ca n't happen . 
i think so , but i 've never seen it so acute . 
well , we have <number> lead and that 's what i 'm looking into next . 
go ahead and waste your time . 
i 'll get to it right away , <person> <person> . 
please , <person> . just for a minute . <person> enough for me to see the effect . 
oh , that 's right , i keep forgetting . comes in pretty handy down here , bub . 
<number> more turn ... 
alright , get in the car before i have to embarrass you in front of your friend . 
< u > my dog < /u > . <number> i intend to put to sleep . extrapolate from there . 
is 'their ' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that i mean , extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ? 
had n't even opened the thing since cub scouts . 
never been out of it . i 'm gon na beat that fat man ... with that curly hair , and those diamond rings , and that carnation . 
you sure you 've done this before ? 
yeah ? 
do you have music up there ? 
you leave the kid alone . 
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she 's either hungry or she 's tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that . 
i see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last <number> months . each <number> in the amount of $ <number> . he then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account . 
& quot ; those who travel far and near this will make you disappear ! & quot ; 
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump . 
you plotted the course of cyclops ? then that 's < u > our < /u > course ! wherever < u > he < /u > goes , < u > we < /u > go ... ..until we get him ! 
i 'm collateral anyway , so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this ! 
uh , thanks . 
well that 's a ... long story ... 
when i 'm in high school i 'm not going to play any football . i 'm just going to concentrate on class rank . what did you do in high school ? 
each to his fate , lad . 
shooting me wo n't get you anywhere .

<person> dad ~ i 'll need you upstairs for homework in about ... . oh , <number> minutes .

<person> wade .

no . 
maybe you should n't . do n't get happy . this changes nothing between you and me . you did a good thing and <person> <person> wanted to thank you for it . 
you mean it 's a girls ' band ? 
the ship 's depressurizing , the engines overheating . when it reaches the core , we 're done . 
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure . 
news travels fast on broadway -- you had to get away from a rat -- 
<number> alive , <number> not . yet both in pain . 
we have to send somebody over there immediately ! if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy . we 'll be off the hook . there 's a flight to rome in <number> hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily . 
wonderful ? he kissed her and played with her titty , and i do n't see anything so great about that . he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him . 
what do we have here ? a lovely new supply of venom . i 'll just take this to my laboratory for further study . 
now you get up ! and you get in my house ! 
she 'll be away on friday between <number> o'clock and <number> in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt . if she 's to make the journey there and back in the day she 's to have no distractions the night before . she 'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early . 
and why should i ? let him howl if it makes him feel good . consarn it . he 's better off than i am ! i wish i could tell <person> ... ... up there , just what i think . 
thank you for calling me taylor . dr. <person> , i know who i am . who are you ? how did this upside down civilization ever get started ? 
please excuse me a moment , <person> , and i 'll get to the dishes . 
look , i 'm supposed to fix up your script . there 's nothing in the deal about my staying here . 
when ? 
call them back . 
what things made you so sure ? 
so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; <person> flips out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring <person> and <person> into the cover story -- 
sheronda passin ' the money onto someone else , that 's what the hell i 'm talkin ' 'bout . 
you 're <person> <person> . <person> <person> . 
is anything wrong , sir ? 
very weird . 
no i 'm not okay ! i do n't know what the hell i 'm doing ! 
i 'm a writer . <person> <person> – 
mass production is what does it . 
average . 
oh , <person> <person> . 
you wrote a play on it , what play is that ? 
i 'm trying to reach lieutenant beldere ... 
tomorrow . 
why would a man leave his apartment <number> times , on a rainy night , with a suitcase ? and come back <number> times ? 
all new houses have noises . 
i know you are , <person> ... ... you conquer a woman from within herself , you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love . 
the goddamn sign on the wall . i ca n't do unauthorized work ? what am i suppose to do ? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation . 
come on , <person> . do n't let him do this ! ! ! 
it 's not what you think it is . 
o fair <person> , if you will love me soundly with your french heart , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue . do you like me , <person> ? 
good old frank . and how is fat mr . <person> <person> these days ? 
well -- what have we here ? a family . 
... well that does n't excuse his behavior . 
they do n't have to . 
you 'd cosmetically alter <person> to look like me ? 
i want you to do this work . 
but -- i mean -- for a woman -- and -- you 've done awfully well -- 
did she ? you were pretty thick at <number> time . 
... come on , <person> , i already put my shoes on ... 
no . 
+ the nose is sharper . <person> too . + & lt ; & lt ; and what about the hair ? you said something earlier about it. & gt ; & gt ; 
when 's that , a week ? <number> weeks ? ... we have to figure out a plan of action now . 
duh . what else would i be talking about ? now stop askin ' stupid doorknob questions . well , a year and a half ago , this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour . he snagged this coke . but , he 's a good cop with a wife and a kid , so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust . 
yes ... you run this hotel . 
... and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments . 
where 's the girl ? <person> <person> . 
drinks are free , right ? 
i ca n't say that i 've paid that much attention to 'em before . 
but you did n't do that . 
woogie , please , you 're starting to scare me . 
<person> . <person> whom ? 
-- but i got ta say i think there 's something to this cold climate business . i mean , you go to the beach- what do you do ? drink a few beers , wait for a fish to flop up on the sand . ca n't build no civilization that way . you got a hard winter coming , though , you got to plan ahead , and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout . 
what 's that ? 
what 's this ? 
not even close . <person> , we ca n't even make syria or iraq . 
<person> , cowan , i found out literally just before the ceremony . ' apparently you 're to report for further review . 
this is my house too ! 
i 'm hungry ! where 's my dinner ? who ate my dinner ? huh ? who 's in trouble now ? 
i ca n't stand that polecat . they ought to hang him . 
walk him over to <person> <person> , buy him an ice . it 'll kill <number> minutes . 
m'sieu monescu ! 
seems like we have another <number> every week . 
she know ? 
how <number> doing ? 
shuttle en route . 
yeah . 
doolittle , doolittle , where are you ? 
steering wheel ... gear shift ... dashboard ... 
... and it 's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone . it 's considered offensive . 
you have n't been bothering them , have you ? 
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this . 
no . i can not take orders from that underwear model . that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking <number> victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator . 
her assistant ? 
besides , the sooner you go pro , the sooner you 'll have to deal with the mess i 'm dealing with . 
yes , doolittle . 
<person> did . he 's the perfect suspect , do n't you think ? 
maybe i 'll see you later , when i pick up my car ? 
what about the tapes ? 
well . there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about . 
you 're early ... it 's not ready . what happened ? 
but what can we do ? she do n't know who 's visiting her ... 
no . he gets shot by the old lady . 
allie , i know exactly why you 're doing this . 
the order comes from starfleet command , dr. <person> , direct from the general staff . 
that needle ai n't pointing north ! 
i do n't know why . as long as it 's light enough to see your caddie . 
you 're really crazy . 
yes . 
another ? but that 's too soon ! tomorrow night ? it 's impossible ! did he say a <number> ? 
that was quite a thing you did today . 
and you like me . 
what should i say ? you did fine work . we 'll wait on the lab . 
where 's <person> ? 
what kinda music do you like ? 
i bet i know what changed your mind ... ... my mother . she was so horrible , you decided you could n't desert me . 
what 'd he say before ? he saw a girl ? 
we have to go back for <person> ! 
oh , you mean -- puss in boots . 
i think he has a little thing for <person> . 
what ? <person> , what 's wrong ? 
utah , you copy bruddah ? 
yah , that can happen . 
you ruthless son of a bitch . you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world ? 
i am a suicide risk . 
i wonder no longer . you were out of the country . 
you win , <person> . you win all along the line . why did n't we think of brandon before -- or did we -- some of us . yeah . of course you did . when a suspect thinks he 's safe , you go on letting him think he 's safe . <person> for a mistake . 
no . <person> talked to his parents . 
inside . 
she must really be something . from a clinical point of view . 
who knew that when i started working in the finest foreign car shop in la , i would also find the light of my life . 
i could n't wait <number> weeks ! she 's gettin ' married tomorra ! 
what ? 
mainly that you 're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers . 
who 's he ? 
thanks . but either way it still feels ... 
it 's me . 
why would n't they ? look at hyenas , jackals , nearly all species of predator birds -- 
thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop . 
after the gulls attacked . 
what ? 
scared . no , not scared . wary . like i was something to be ... her guard went up . i was a threat . now i know why . she was afraid she 'd be seen . that i would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was . i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal . but that 's the cycle , right ? i knew a little more than she did , she knew a little more than her mother , and on and on . i guess that 's part of the reason why -- 
... how long ? 
will you pardon me ? 
are you going to leave , too ? 
i did not conduct at at the rally , i conducted on the evening before the rally . 
tank . 
where ? [ <person> ] it 's <person> is n't it ? he 's doing stuff , is n't he ? 
guess that 's what they call <person> hospitality . 
i 'd just tell my sister , <person> . 
he needs someone incredible , someone really close , who he can trust ... 
<person> <person> came in the side door through the porch , you know ? where i was makin ' a jelly and banana sandwich ? i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin ' that night with <person> and <person> <person> , the desoto sisters . <person> <person> must have known nobody but me was home , cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter . 
half a flounder . <person> ... a burlap bag ... a paint can ... aha ! 
my company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me . and i have a wife . <person> would nullify my insurance . <person> does not . 
we are in desperate want of a mercutio , <person> , a young nobleman of verona

sounds great , <person> . 
i 'm trying to explain it to you . so you play the piano . when you look at the keys , you see music , you see <person> . 
i did n't . she came to me a few days ago . to put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me . she thought you might lighten that burden . 
come on , come on , fork up the scub . 
she looks a little old for you . about thirty-five , forty years old ? 
`` no '' ? `` no '' to which part ? ? 
i believe so . 
i do n't know . i thought maybe i was -- 
i 'll tell you what makes sense ! <person> strikes ! white phosphorus ! napalm ! we 'll bomb the shit out of them if they do n't do what we want . 
if they come down low enough to make a firing pass , they 'll never be able to pull up in time . 
as long as it 's not 'what 's your sign ? ' 
want a drink ? great nap . <person> na go out tonight ? 
honey . 
ok , have fun there , you 're so lucky you do n't have any kids yet and you can go off to japan ... call me when you get back . 
d'artagnan . perhaps you should accept his offer , for we are dead anyway . 
it may have happened , but not the way you said . 
no -- the rent in paid . the lady asked us to promise , i would n't open the door . 
when i write my memoirs i think i 'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force <number> .

goodwill ... 
you 've been watching too much tv .

because in my life , it would n't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he 's from and a place where he 's going to . it 'd be too simple . i probably would n't know how to handle a situation like that . 
i do n't know . how do you ?

the hell with the diamonds ! 
yes , <person> <person> ? so ? 
i did n't need to know that a man i 'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs ? 
liz -- can i call you liz ? it 's a beautiful name -- 
i bet you do . 
mighty good of you to come out , squire -- sparing all this time to -- sheriff , too -- and schoolmaster -- mighty nice .

hey you hear the news . i just got a job at a new firm : `` <person> , <person> 'em and <person> . '' yuk yuk . 
he took the day off .

what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ? 
what did you do to your hair ? 
i 'm so sorry about that . it was rude . i think i just got nervous for some reason . 
oh no . i 'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to manhattan beach , taking that left down to little tiny waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic , and your life flashes before your eyes , but -- hey , i 've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here 's my sister <person> to pick us up . thanks , though . bye . 
nothing . go back to the show , <person> .

anastasia 's music box ... she had this all these years ... you could have found it ... 
my mom used to get pms too . 
well , what <person> you think is gon na be here in this house with a girl ? 
i could teach her my `` french flipper '' trick ... 
a half-a-million dollars will always be missed .

what 's your point ? 
i thought it was okay where it was . 
then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed , feeling , human friends . they have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the < u > <number> < /u > -- you -- was more important to them .

<number> of your cases ?

you would not believe what -- 
bad people . 
hector , do n't interrupt me . 
how about rapacious and love- starved ? 
or rather , do you think you 're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto ? 
how long until it blows ? 
well , no you did n't -- 
do you find that this approach usually works , or , let me guess , you 've never tried it before . in fact , you do n't normally approach girls , am i right ? the truth is that you 're a quite , sensitive type but if i 'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you : witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal , a little bit crazy , a little bit bad , but , hey , do n't us girls just love that ? 
i 'm askin ' ya to go to him -- as a favor . 
yes ! 
no idea . 
you said we were n't `` real , '' cole ...

it better be fifteen minutes , because <person> is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter 's clicking away to beat the band . 
round of golf saturday ? 
oh

the money , <person> . 
i do n't know . maybe in literature . that 's his section .

i ca n't get over how cute the girls in this city are .

<person> left ? 
what do you mean by that ?

was she <number> of your teachers ? 
has he gotten through to any ? 
i will not go . 
i sometimes fade out . 
i did n't know you had such beautiful hair . 
that was a cheap shot ! 
who sent you ? 
because i 'm working the night shift - and i got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there 's a lull - 
really nice wheels , by the way . 
you 're telling me this maniac is a cop ? what the hell am i supposed to do with that <number> ? 
<person> was right -- it 's easier for me to understand suicide . i 'm a practicing suicide . 
i 'd like that . 
well i 've got a little surprise for you . 
but i got a train to make . 
you 're a bad , bad girl , <person> . 
thank you . 
uh-huh . till my wing [ <number> ] went bad . 
you 're twenty-two , are n't you , <person> ? 
what -- when ? 
<person> <person> ... yeah , he 's like the <person> <person> <person> of s+m flicks , supposed to be a real weirdo . 
you know -- hemingway , sexton , <person> , <person> , <person> <person> . you ca n't kill yourself before you 've even been published . 
<person> <person> was checking my prostate this morning . i got an erection . 
sean -- you 're not real . 
they 're having a farewell party the last night . before the mask goes back to taiwan . 
no , thanks sheriff . i 'm leaving town tonight . 
i 'm rash and i 'm stupid and what am i doing with you ? 
you think so ? 
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking ? 
i 'm not going to leave you . 
if they attack you ... 
did n't do very well , did you ? 
did you say cable junction ? 
i thought you said you 'd show me your place . 
any casualties ? 
fine . <person> . 
mitch knows lots of people in san francisco . of course , they 're mostly hoods . 
oh , now , i 'm afraid that 's been exaggerated some -- 
the big picture . 
you still pretty upset ? 
it is n't a secret . she plays with me . she plays with me in the garden all the time . right out there in the garden , she does ! 
i 've been in the same class with <person> for years but we were n't tight or anything . 
so it could have been neither of them ? 
remember that business venture i was telling you about ? well , my tugboat came in . i 'm flush . 
while <person> and i take out the back <number> cars ... 
no -- but i can hardly wait -- mister -- tell me , will there really be -- -- a man that eats fire ? 
he 's not ? 
uh ... uh ... what is it ? 
i 'd hardly call our yardman a friend . 
you want us to come with you ? i just have to run to the main house and give <person> <person> a check . 
oh ... not a real doctor . 
jon , where are we ? 
they did it to me ! 
right . 
er ... if ... we ... er ... 
i 've spent over <number> hours interviewing him . <person> killed <person> and <person> <person> because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered <person> <person> . after seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should be done . the question is , what does <person> have to do with <person> <person> ? 
let 's ditch this place and party . 
we followed your instructions . 
hello , <person> . <person> . just a little gag of mine . thought i 'd have some fun with you . 
there 's nothing to be sorry about . 
why , thank you travis . 
pretty handy with that scatter gun , <person> . you raised on a farm ? 
i love you like my dad loves <person> . i wan na live here . 
what ? ! 
do n't you think i know that ? i do n't have any choice . 
i would like to marry you . but i have already promised myself ... to god . 
shut up . 
do n't need it , i 'm a cat , i 've got <number> lives . 
say ! 
who , <person> <person> ? 
we 're <number> and sixteen . 
you sure this is such a bright idea ? 
come on ! 
how 's the store ? 
sign here and here . hey , ai n't you the folks workin ' on that whole hulabaloo from last night ? 
yeah , i reserved the tee time about a month ago . 
see , <number> day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor <person> <person> 's house and <person> fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious . i had to dive in and save him . 
now -- how 'd humpty-dumpty get in here ? 
he 's in the dumps , sir . <person> . every time you have him attack the press , they give it back to him in spades . he 's become the most hated man in america . 
that is both impudent and untrue ... tell me , how did you feel when you viewed our <person> 's latest effort ? or should i say , his `` next-to-latest '' ? 
take that back . 
thank you , <person> . 
mineral baths - now really ! 
sixpack ... 
you got it all in your head ? 
what is this ? what 's going on , who is that ? 
cool , is n't it ? weight , feel , mal1eability , they 're all but identical . on the periodic chart of elements , they 're but <number> proton apart . <person> minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless . 
heís putting on a show , <person> . 
you ca n't , your orders are specific ... 
well , just do n't forget your old friends when you 're rich and famous . 
that 's pretty risky business , <person> . 
but it is n't bad weather now . 
since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on `` <number> minutes '' ? 
there 's another man -- right outside the booth here . i never saw him before . 
cocks his thompson . <person> down behind some sandbags . 
almost that fast . i got a few loose ends to tie up first . <person> into a shitload of money recently . i 've always wanted to go to take a trip . we 're just gon na walk into the airport and decide right then and there . 
blade . we 've got <number> reapers . they 're all dead . 
ms. langenkamp . i suggest you go home and get some rest . your son is fine . he 's been taken downstairs for further testing . 
laura , now i ca n't find that blue sweater . did you take it again ? 
i do n't know . it 's a maze of tunnels . i ca n't see out . 
i 'm sorry . 
tournel will take you the rest of the way ... 
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail . 
why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him ? 
half the german army 's on our tail and you want me to go to <person> ? into the lion 's den ? 
yes , quite . 
yeah . yes . i do n't follow music too much . 
not black . 
once you 'd seen my sister you 'd never forget her . 
a .45 -- 
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given . i 'm not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but you must have known i was not a great fool ; you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me . 
does it make it easier to win ? 
you never spoke so well of him . 
it 's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the himalayas . 
have n't felt it a bit . <person> inside with the air conditioner blastin ' all day long . 
i have thought about you . 
well , they 're a good outfit . 
i dunno -- she fills gaps . 
<person> <person> <person> . <person> , long time . i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden ! 
after the market , you followed me to the hotel . 
you mean , you 're gon na -- 
<person> finlay ? 
i do n't want to go this way . 
i was here this afternoon . 
sacha , she 's had enough . 
smoking ? i 'm not smoking . 
the safe 's a simpson <number> . last time i played the game , <person> only had a <number> . 
no way . 
hey , <person> , why so glum ? everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare . 
what , again ? 
is very angry . 
we have a lot in common . 
it 's ... an eagle ? 
why , why do you think that is ? 
you 'd think now , with only <number> weeks before they ship me back home , it would be easier . but it is n't . 
do you ? 
well , i did n't want to say anything , but i thought the dead man was my brother . 
is that why you say it 's horrible ? 
yes . 
no . <person> . <person> . my family 's in tuxedo , new york , though . 
i 've already seen your photographs . 
where are you going ? 
let 's get out of here ! i 'll lose my job ! 
well . 
that 's not a spear . it 's a pike . 
then let him go and he 'll follow you . 
... afraid . 
because since i 'm just starting out , i 've got a fresh point of view , and that 's good for , you know , marketing , demographics ... 
how 's the arm ? still sore ? 
medallions . 
aye , that 's <person> . he ... ummmm , lives here now . the lodger . that 's what he is ... he ... he rents your room . <person> confronts <person> . 
what 's the problem ? 
<person> tully . 
you did n't ask me to meet you <number> miles from my office for a bible study class . 
where did you go ? 
in real life when does he hit you ? 
very much . 
good night . 
it 's twelve o'clock . 
right . 
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is `` <person> <person> and engineering '' , am i correct ? 
jungle man fix <person> . 
hi ... am i late ? 
no . 
so , of course , you could n't kill <person> because there never was a simone . 
dead ! 
hungry ? after <number> years in the burmese jungle . i am starving , <person> <person> -- starving for a white shoulder -- 
yes ? 
you wanted to see me , admiral ? 
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer . 
there you go again . you 're nothing but false notes . 
far cry from new york . 
all combat takes place at night , in the rain , and at the junction of <number> map segments ... 
hell no . besides i 'm just a radio call away if something happens . i feel i should keep abreast of what happens , seeing it 's my jurisdiction and all . 
a monster ? but he built this for the woman he loved , like the taj mahal . 
beat it out and get hold of some guys . 
well , what ? 
when i met him i was just <number> . and he was <number> . i saw the gold ring and just grabbed on . and he was going to make me a star . 
no , i 'm not . i 'm looking at you . 
so , mccall , how come you ended up in san francisco ? 
in <number> , we had an employee here , name of fowler . he was very popular , too . turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the actuarial department tying up the switchboard , figuring the odds on our i.b.m . machines -- so the day before the kentucky derby , i called in the vice squad and we raided the thirteenth floor . 
i said , no thanks . 
i 've got to stop and help those people . 
a what ? 
wait ! he works for you ? 
what do you mean all of a sudden ? you 've been going with her <number> months . 
no , i , you know , i help 'em out . i empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch . that kind of thing . 
i 'm sorry nobody could come . 
who 's that ? 

i 'm heading out of town . 
yes , sir . three times . 
when i ask questions , i like to hear answers . 
do i know you ? 
you 're kidding . 
look , yeah , he 's an ass , but he 's my brother . que sera-sera . 
then show some . they 'll shut me down ! 
sometimes people think they lose things and they did n't really lose them . it just gets moved . 
first of all , <person> , when you go rekall , you get nothing but first class memories : private cabin on the shuttle ; deluxe suite at the hilton ; plus all the major sights : <person> <person> , the grand canals , and of course ... venusville . 
when was the last time you had a girlfriend ? 
save your strength . 
i 'm fine ... see you ... 
no ... no ... 
do you mean <person> of england ? 
no , <person> , no . 
will you marry me ? 
too proud to admit you 're crazy about me , dr. <person> ? 
you know that we checked the <number> ao-units that you reported in imminent failure condition ? 
get them together . 
chip , honey ? 
not at all . and you could do me a big favor , if you would- 
what the hell is he talking about ? 
we have a problem here ? 
ben , i 'm afraid i 've got to ask -- 
sure . what do you want me to call you ? 
though i guess who it 'll really be rough on is your husband . 
hello , <person> . 
no ... . 
then why do you ? 
i been thinking . i hope we 're not gon na have a lotta trouble about my name down there . because like what 's the whole point of this trip anyway ? 
kyle , what 's it like when you go through time ? 
`` what ? '' look at you ... you sense a mark . 
you ca n't see the whole ... the whole complete act yet . not yet . but , when this is done , it 's going to be ... so ... so ... 
what 'd you tell that casino manager ? 
i 'll be asking the questions . last night , you hear anything unusual ? <person> ? shouts ? 
that does n't sound metal . 
yeah . 
how does anything like this ever start ? all i know is the bank called our loan . 
really ? for most people it 's a rather pleasant experience . what exactly did you ... 
if you 'd apologize i think <person> would take you back . 
oh , <person> ! what happened ? are you all right ? 
who is who ? 
there is no news big enough . 
we have to talk . whether to kill yourself is <number> of the most important decisions a teenager has to make . 
what is it ? 
where 's <person> ? 
well ? 
i know . i know . i know . i just wan na chew your face and scoop out your beautiful , beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em . <person> . 
-- <person> ! <person> was your massage ? 
otis ! no barking ! 
yeah , but when they went off people were n't making fun of them . they were n't bozos ! i 'm <person> <person> again ! 
are you okay ? 
you are no good to me -- in jail . 
i want this thing to go to court , but my lawyer 's telling me to settle . 
<number> . 
we record and document it . we 're gon na make history , <person> . the first documented , unrefuted evidence of life after death . the book sales alone will be worth millions . i 'll be rich , and you my friend , will have <number> hell of a thesis paper . now , what time is orientation ? 
do n't hate me but i love this pattern . 
just a guard . 
dad , you have to talk to coach for me . 
you have a great profile . 
you look marvelous . there 's nothing to say . you 're going to marry <person> . next week , no less . 
we 're a thousand miles from anybody else , man . it 's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better . 
right , right ... okay.. you do n't think he 's gon na think i 'm too aggressive ? 
<person> promised me he would never take off this ring . 
when ? 
no , <person> . it 's not me . you 're mistaken . 
it 's <person> 's grandfather . 
oh . 
in this courtroom , <person> <person> , justice is blind . to matters of race , creed , color , religion . and sexual orientation . 
if you ca n't do what i ask , <person> , use that money to go back home , then . 
and living out here , in this rest home asylum , that 's what you want ? 
a <number> times . 
let 's just say we have a destiny to fulfil , you and i . 
tore off <number> of my chests . 
you never know , you might be lucky this time . 
you tied the cord around its neck . 
i might have an idea ... 
dr. macfarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl ? 
drink up , <person> . we 're ahead of you . 
you did n't answer my question . 
this is a gift you 'll not return . 
well , what am i supposed to say ? `` i ca n't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere '' ? ! 
you want to change rooms ? 
i do n't know . i have n't caught anything yet . 
that 's what the <person> said . 
but i do n't have it . 
it 's nothing . it 's just a picture . 
would you like me to help you pass them back ? 
so , uh ... how 's college goin ' ? 
maybe so . but i think we need to ask <person> about it . 
not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick <number> . 
... massachussettans are n't . 
what are you doing ? 
look who 's talking <person> . you got more homes than i do . 
bullshit ! prove it . 
he wo n't -- i mean , he did n't the last time . he 'll be expecting fifty <number> and there it is -- on top . 
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl . fire her . or something . 
perhaps a little refreshment first ? a little coffee , or a little chocolate ? 
<person> <person> ... p ... i ... e ... t ... r ... a ... s ... z ... k ... i ... e ... w ... i ... c ... z . 
he ca n't hear you ! 
i drink . 
i 'm a little late , that 's all . 
become ? <number> is born a saint . 
does what feel comfortable ? 
eh , he 's puttin ' 'em in backwards ! 
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home . 
... i 'm sorry ... 
i know what i saw . i 've seen him enough times . 
why do you say that ? is there something wrong ? 
please ... wait . 
- in this case , apparently , as trustworthy as the world almanac ! 
no it 's not . it was <person> . 
that 's a pretty ugly thing you just said . 
some of you i know , some of you i 'm meeting for the first time . 
stu ? is that you ? where did you < u > go < /u > ? 
toss us out on our ass . 
who 's my cream puff ? 
i talked to ruth a little bit , and i think it 's about time ... 
yesterday that might 've meant something . pull me off . you 'd be doing me a big favor . 
it 's reply paid . 
i 'm cleaning my stove . 
ah . the director of `` <person> <person> <person> . '' 
yes . 
stop talking like a monk ! just fight ! 
where did you learn to kiss like that ? 
waiting for <person> . 
cotton . 
you seem a little edgy . everything okay ? 
how do you do that ? 
a cabdriver . he picked me up in the pudding shoppe in the bazaar . 
what 's that ? 
i trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties , <person> ? 
it looked like a fuckin ' gun ! 
yes , but what does a farmer do if he do n't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks ? 
a prior engagement overcame me . 
yeah . 
same shit . 
the best way to get to yankee stadium is <person> <person> . 
so what happened to mr . <person> ? i hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to europe . 
every once in a while some cat comes to me . he wants to know how i made it . how did i become a success ? the first thing i tell them is : follow your instincts . let your instincts guide you . the second thing i tell them is , for <person> 's sake : you got to know your grammar . 
fight fair , son ... use your fists ! 
can i help you ? 
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit . 
what do you want ? 
are you stupid or what ? 
you prep the gravity couches . i 'm going to manually arm those explosives . 
that 's <person> <person> . i could n't quite figure him out , but he seemed very eager and excited when we met . 
my truck overheated , so i opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt . so i had to get a haircut . 
what do you want me to say ? i 'm in prison . you should know . you put me here . 
the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god ... and understand the word of god . not enough for you to hear what i 'm sayin ' , you got ta understand . 
<person> bridger , director . and brother . she slammed the door in my face , <person> . said i was <person> 's child and <person> was dead . and it struck me , what a good idea ! so i watched her , made a little home movie , a little family film . <person> <person> , mom , really got around . i mean , <person> <person> was <number> thing , everybody knew about that , but <person> 's father , that was the key ! your boyfriend did n't like seeing his daddy in my movies . did n't like it at all . and once i supplied the motive , all the kid needed was a few pointers . have a partner to sell out in case you get caught , find someone to frame , it was like her was making a movie . 
i been thinkin ' ... 
<person> , it 's not me ! i love you ! it 's god ! 
yes . i am . i 'm sorry to antagonize you . 
mank , sit down . you missed the opening of the new picture but i 'll go back -- 
gee ! that musta been terrible . i guess he had it coming to him though . but do n't you worry about me . i do n't talk . i never talk . take my word for it . <person> , i would n't want anything to happen to my kids . 
i remember ... from always ... at first i prayed to you ... come and get me ... take me home ... you did n't come ... 
well sure , colonel -- 
i 've got to stick by <person> ... he feels trapped . 
<person> ' those ? 
that was my first instinct too . or d.w.i . anything but this . and i 'm going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him . 
where is it ? this place ? 
-- go ! 
it does ? what ? 
he 's gone sweetheart . he 's gone ! 
<number> !

... uh ... no , that 's ... 
i wo n't be staying . 
he 's dead . 
her name was <person> . 
y'all come back .

i have an anniversary coming up , thought i 'd buy her something special .

d'you know something , `` they '' do n't worry me at all . <person> , i only fancy listening to you ... that 's all but if it worries you ... well ... 
it would n't be my first choice , no . 
who the fuck knows ? i think we 're gon na go ... we worked it out to algeria . so , i do n't know . so i 'll go to algeria . 
have you always wanted to be a lawyer ? 
he 's lunching with the man who 's buying the harris street property , you know , that oil lease man ... so that 's why he 's late . you getting a headache ? 
rita ... i want you to stay here and you do n't have to give me that money . 
well i 'm a nail technician , and i think we both ought to stick to what we know .

if you mean ... she is a lieutenant in the army nursing corps , captain . 
if we beat them , they can both go home stag ! single-o ! alone ! <person> can come back in this boat ! 
you should know if you bring in anything over ten <number> you have to declare it . you forgot or what ? you could get a <number> <number> and fifty <number> dollar fine , plus <number> years in prison . now you want to talk to us about it , or you want to talk to <person> ?

are you cold ? would you like a blanket ? 
now , <person> -- 
good wages , eh ! <person> ' oranges an ' peaches ? 
but , finally , <number> factor tipped the scales . we received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build <number> . 
and when i consider that , i have to wonder if you do n't have some ulterior motive for being here , with me , right now . 
heh , heh , heh ! golly bob howdy --
