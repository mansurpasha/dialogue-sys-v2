hell if i know , crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas . 
mad ! darling , there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off . i love you for some of them - and in spite of others . i have n't let those become too important to me . they 're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you 've got to keep your teeth sharp . all right . but you will not sharpen them on me - or on eve ... 
please , do n't tell me those things ... not now . this is my last drink . how much money can you lend me ? 
there wo n't be any need for that sir .

he knows . 
you should be dead . how do you feel ? 
i know i give him <number> threes . we ca n't let him get away with that . 
i 'm really sorry , <person> . 
i 'm sorry that was out of line . 
bullshit . it was a misunderstanding . but instead of handling it politely , instead of treating her with respect -- 
why , <person> ? 
you like bourbon ? 
and you did n't see anything at all ? 
this gon na take long ? 
what 'd she die of ? 
please , <person> , do n't beg him . 
glad of it . 
... long overdue . 
i can see him right now ! 
scott , i want you to meet <person> 's nemesis , <person> <person> . 
look ... what i 'm doing is none of your business ... 
where 'd this come from ? 
and a sort of slightly sick feeling ? 
yes . that 's true , you 're getting a hell of a reputation . 
who is that ! ? 
why are you always leaving me , <person> ? 
are the horses stragglin ' or are n't they ? 
and i 'll lay odds you got that bracelet . 
do n't you dare to be civil with me ! all this time you were leading me on -- 
this shit 's peanuts compared to what we 're gon na make with <person> . 
it 's on the twine , too . but it 's not r ... 
not a word ! <person> 's sewed up every paper . they 're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires ! 
he 's a former boyfriend . we lived together for about <number> months . and yes , i 'll admit it . i 've still kind of got a thing for him . that 's what you wanted to know , is n't it ? 
let me tell you somethin ' , boy ! i do n't care if both of my legs was cut off ! i can do more work in that field , than you could in a <number> years ! 
... apprehensive . <person> 's not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show . <person> , california 's loaded with galleries . 
strap yourself in , sweetheart , we 're taking off ! 
but what about me ? 
why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby ? 
not tonight - not this nochy . 
do you know how they were damaged ? 
where 'd she get you ? 
yes , but that 's not the issue . what 's on your wish list , <person> ? pleading <person> out to first degree man on both homicides , with an agreed sentence of <number> to life running concurrent ? come on ... what 're you looking for here ? 
a baby is not going to fix everything . besides , i do n't know if i 'm ready to be a father . 
the theatres are all closed by the plague ! 
if we ca n't go back , is there an alternate route ? 
mmmmmmm . 
i 'll drive you , darlin ' . you 've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile . you do n't think about what you 're doing and you 'll run into a telephone pole . 
hey , do n't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin ' it on ? 
for science . 
what was what ? 
i have not touched your sh -- stuff . you watching this ? 
'certainly . and little <person> ? ' 
so you do n't mind ? 
a woman . 
how do you know i 'm not ? 
i 've been telling myself it 's the award winning journal article i 'm going to write . but it 's not . it 's you . 
you will never behave like that again ! do you understand ? 
i do n't think he 'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check . i 've been through this a hundred times . 
that pudwapper just stepped on my foot . 
take off and meet me at eagle cave . 
we retrieved a few things from the trunk , including a steamer trunk , or the remnants of a trunk , the brass clips and so forth . 
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior -- 
i think you have the wrong number . 
when do you have to be here ? 
`` it 's why the witch kills children . '' 
i woke up the next morning and she was gone . 
what if they do n't want help ? what if they 're just angry and they want to hurt somebody ? 
better this month than last ? 
yes ... 
okay , what happened right before he disappeared ? 
these things get around , <person> . <number> warders talk as it might be , and somebody ca n't help overhearing what they say . then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it . how about putting me in for this new treatment , <person> ? 
how ? 
i agree . 
yes , i did , <person> . but i—i had no idea what was going on . 
sure you could , <person> -- but you would n't want to do that , would you ? you would n't want to kill anybody . 
mike ... 
and how fucking dare you cast <person> <person> in that part ? have you any idea how humiliating that is for me ? i 'm an actress ! it 's about our marriage for fuck 's sake . everybody knows that ... 
i just did . 
it 's not what it looks like , vanessa . at ease , boys . 
and do you amuse the guests ? 
you know what that would mean ? to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he 'll testify ? 
i do n't know , though , i feel so guilty because <person> is paying for it , so , you know , so i do feel guilty if i do n't go to bed with him . but if i do go to bed with him , it 's like i 'm going against my own feelings . i do n't know i-i ca n't win . 
she 's jus ' wore out , that 's all . 
he came from paris with <person> . 
talby ! 
that 's between you and yourself , norma . 
was n't supposed to be back till <number> . <person> rolls in at <number> . 
simple . we sedate him , induce a somnolesent state , and study his rem patterns when he 's unconscious . if he has the disorder , his rems will be highly abnormal . <person> smiles . 
we 're tracking the cellular phone bill . 
you think i 'm pushy now , wait 'til i get you on the stand ... 
does he know about what happened ? 
you know , we 're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not . 
that 's what you believe she is ? the sum of her psychological parts ? 
this is an incredible story - about a man hunting an <person> , he 's been telling me about <person> , he thinks he 's been there , but his map , the route he 's describing , he could n't survive the journey now , but he 's a poet , so his map is poetry - and now we 're onto an <person> . i 'm telling her your map is poetry . the <person> shrugs . 
i 'll lead 'em out . 
let me guess -- gozer worshippers . 
but i like it i guess . 
come on , ma . out with it . who came out first ? 
finally , some gratitude . 
because i 'm not allowed to . i still do , after work . so , what ? should we just break up ? is that what you 're saying ? because if you are , i 'm going to run out of patience . 
he ai n't dead . 
-- do you know where she is , detective ? do you know how to find her ? even where to start ? we will find them . 
no . i was in the shower . 
ok lassies , i think it 's time you get to gripping reality . 
looks like to me you 're just plain scared . 
... somewhere there is a distant light , guiding us through this rocky shoal ... ' 
what 's in there ? 
maid or not , it fits you . 
i meant no disrespect . 
please , sir . 
cameras ? 
maybe i better ask around , see what your pals think . 
why do you all have such funny names ? 
it 's a mistake , honey . you <number> go on . i 'll walk back to the depot . 
how long ? 
morning , gentlemen . everything satisfactory ? you like your office ? 
you mean coitus ? 
i just wondered . why were you trouble ? 
did you like proteus or valentine best ? proteus for speaking , <person> for looks . 
you 're going to steal the leads ? 
you do n't mind me saying , <person> <person> , you look like hell . 
uh , do you mind if i wait ? i really need to talk to her . 
you have to get out of here . <person> as soon as possible . go to any rural town , away from any major city ... 
sure . <person> , that 's great ! to engineer your comeback , we 're gon na need a whole slate of pictures . once `` <person> <person> <person> '' takes off , we 'll slam you into <number> , then another , then another ! 
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining ... 
a tragedy . but that was a boating accident ; no bites , no sharks , nothing but a boating accident . 
oh , yes you will , <person> dear . . . you 're very clever . 
that 's the truth -- every single word ! 
yeah . 
all moorings are clear , captain .

i do n't need a doctor , i need a different job .

first of all : you , shut up . now , you 've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover . every time the <person> <person> strikes , we shift a hundred detectives to that area . but there 's just too much open land , too many riverbeds to ride , caves to hide in . this gang operates across <number> states , often riding a hundred miles between jobs .

i want to ask you a question . do you think ... time travel is possible ? 
i knew . 
so what ? 
... maybe i better forget it . 
uh-huh . 
how could she turn on me like that ? i thought she liked me . 
and he 's a patient of yours ? 
jeffrey ... this is wonderful . 
she 's a precog ? 
but you said you liked men to use their hands . 
fine . while i retrieve my diamonds , you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair . she 's frozen in - 
call me tomorrow . 
senator daddy must be thrilled . 
drop that fucking money ! 
are you saying it 's a mistake , that you did n't go to any meetings ? they say you did . 
you 're implying that i planted a gun ? 
you did n't have to do this . 
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs . 
impressive -- is it not ? the problem is i can only keep the illusion for a few minutes . i need more power to hold the form longer . i need the highlander . where is he ? 
yeah . nice touch . it 's the logo from `` you bet your life '' , right ? 
` why does n't he come live with us ? ' because everything is here . 
where is he ? talk -- or you 're dead . damn it , tell me ! tell me ! 
omgs , <person> , nazi low-riders , prison gangs ? 
you used me as bait ? ! 
thank god , it 's up to you , pal . sup to you ... 
they got a great little band at el chico , in the village -- it 's practically around the corner from where you live . 
do n't tell me your toothache is bothering you again ? 
it would be an added stress to his heart . 
it was n't deep enough . i told you it was n't deep enough , but you would n't listen . 
they range up to <number> thousand . 
right -- i 'm with you , buddy . 
a kind of freedom . 
take a lesson from <person> <person> 's desires , <person> <person> . he follows with you to avenge his father 's death . that i understand . but , what do you want ? 
there are others . 
mmm , nice dress ? or mmm -- <person> , i was insane to let you go ! 
oh , space ! -- you said the right thing . 
and , when lawyers break the law , when this society loses respect for the law , when that day comes , our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground , and our children and grandchildren will live like savages . 
and what 's that ? 
that 's alright , boss . takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings . 
it smelled . 
the craftsmanship is extraordinary . 
hi , <person> . 
i 'm a slow eater . 
and if he 's not ? 
you know your divisions . you like the fights ? like the rough stuff ? yeah , i bet you do . like to get down and tussle a little bit ? like me and <person> , before she got run over , we use to get down on the floor and tussle . i say to her , `` you a good dog , <person> , here 's a treat for you . '' and i give tuffy what every dog love best . you know what that is ? a bone . i can give you a bone , too , girl . 
two-hundred dollars . 
<person> avi 's a zionist nazi . 
p. dad ? 
i 'll say . 
but i could follow it fine . perhaps <person> told you about me . my name 's <person> <person> . 
can i get this ? 
i agree with <person> <person> that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but i do n't think it justifies taking an alarmist position . dr. arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific <number> , and a scientific approach is probably appropriate , at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent . 
anyway , when that boy came over , it was the first time you ever did anything without her . and amy wasn ’ t just jealous ... she was sad and lonely . she missed you . 
i 've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site . 
why do you hide in my room ? 
tomorrow . you have a problem with that ? 
what ! ? 
brung you flowers and all i gettin 's facety back . 
that 's over . way over . 
right . 
well now <person> , how did you come to get so involved ? 
you kill with your left hand ? 
she has a master 's degree in english literature . 
when i 'm on my bike i feel like a wild person . better than any sex i 've ever had . 
i assume you want that to go . 
merci . i ... do you ... would you like to go get a cup of coffee , perhaps ? 
been a lot of years , you know . a long time waiting . for what ? end up feeling like a sap . 
uh , yes ! 
on the count of <number> ! <number> ... <number> ... 
what happen ? 
where in government ?

it 's illegal . 
i already have , sir , and <person> is talking to it now .

what 's that ? 
huh huh huh . he said `` anus . '' 
uh-uh , just cops .

what ? 
i 'm gon na miss you . 
dead gaiijin 's are big news . 
i reckon i do n't care nothin ' about bein ' a free man . i do n't know how to go about it . 
further ... what are you talking about , air ? that makes no sense -- i hold <number> cadet class records -- 
no one . 
what did you say ? 
if i could do that , i 'd be at the goddamn racetrack , not here . 
all right , all right ... it 'll be okay . i mean , eventually it 'll just run out of steam . 
you 're <person> ? 
what 's that little 'droid ' carrying that 's so blasted important ? 
bala , that -- that lake we found -- i think the tunnel 's right underneath it ! -- <person> 's going to < u > flood the < /u > < u > colony < /u > ! ! ! that 's what he meant when said there were too many ants ! 
did she know where <person> was buried ? 
huh ? 
lisa , please ! 
i want to reach people . nobody listens to me . this is my way to reach them . 
you ? 
do you have to swear all the time ? 
you heard it ? 
it is your corrupt we claim . 
yes , you do . now concentrate . 
i 'm an airline pilot . ah , clarence , according to my calculations , with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies . 
they only kill them when they love them ? 
just inner chambers ... 
i wan na live at the beach someday . 
tell me about <person> <person> . 
you live in the neighborhood ? 
you 're wrong . 
<number> hours ... tell me , will evelyn be there as well ? 
i 'm talking about david ravell ! ! 
it 's my daughter <person> ... she 's got ta problem . 
<person> <person> will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour . just like you 've done every morning for the past fifteen years . 
it 's all right . 
and you got some italians -- ? 
what about that squat bar you showed me , is that open on a sunday ? 
area code <number> . 
what ? 
nothing of the kind . <person> and i had a nice talk . 
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase . it 's going to get you into trouble . 
it 's too late . 
you are familiar with how these things are done . in fact , i would like to claim aggrieved status . 
is that good ? 
are you in5ane ? < u > i 'm < /u > the director ! < u > i < /u > make the casting decisions around here ! 
i 'm so sorry . 
do n't they ? he 's down at the tombs right now . 
he only speaks russian ? 
at ease . i 'm sorry we did n't have time to brief before we left gateway but ... 
i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter . i gave my grief to <person> <person> . 
ed , you 're still young . this is the part of your life when you 're < u > supposed < /u > to be struggling . 
i do n't need you to get the money -- my money ! 
she 's not responding ... 
<person> god , auggie . there 's money in here . 
-- big as life -- sparkling away there under the sun . i -- i started walking toward it -- and there was a bus outside -- and -- well -- i -- i just naturally got aboard -- 
not too cool ... 
< u > <person> < /u > ? 
give it back to me . 
you 'll need your confidence , i promise you . 
what 's the problem ? 
yeah yeah yeah - look ! i 've heard this song and dance before , save your breath , you 're coming with me ! <person> goes to turn <person> against the wall but <person> springs back - 
because if you do , i 'll kill you ! 
and you did n't see < u > anything < /u > ? 
deputy art <person> , <person> <person> <person> 's department . 
i 'm not so sure about this . 
no . and i 'm not married . are you happy ? 
everyone loves the girl next door , particularly <person> . 
i did n't take my eyes off it ! 
congratulations , <person> <person> <person> ! 
you 've made me a happy insurance person . 
`` the last unicorn ! '' by <person> <person> . 
i 'm still thinking about it . 
i would build a wall around me with such stone , so the likes of you might never enter . 
why does n't it never work out ? 
how did it end ? 
i am <person> 's cold sweat . 
the hoi polloi . does n't it mean the herd ? 
<person> , but i 'm rusty on surgeons . who 's the girl ? 
what the hell does that mean ? how much more do i have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me ? 
she 's just insecure . once you get to know her she 's fabulous . 
how was the meeting ? 
i think i could figure it out . 
no we 're not . the bodies are all mixed up . we ca n't do this to them . 
maybe she needs help , ted . you should be a gentleman . 
... insulting people who were in the camps . ... what 's the point ? 
no . 
for <number> hundred , what do i get ? 
no . 
why ? 
yeah . there was this cloud and i video taped it . 
what ? ! 
later we found out she was deaf and we had n't even known it . 
you knocked the fucking casket over , for <person> ! 
vince is getting desperate . where is she , <person> ? where 'd you stash her ? 
murder ? 
but does n't <person> dive without anything ? 
hey , i been on the ramp all my life , so i got no problem with the way you help yourself , jake . 
do n't worry . we 'll work something out . 
well ... ... maybe it takes time to get the hang of it . 
i 'm impressed . 
<person> ’ t you think that ’ s a little gimmicky ? 
neo , this is loco . they 've got morpheus in a military-controlled building . even if you somehow got inside , those are agents holding him . <number> of them ! i want <person> back , too , but what you are talking about is suicide . 
if it springs a leak , it 'll be because <person> is making waves . 
i mean if you knew karate ? 
what ? gim me a fucking break . is that what you think ? that your not big enough a deal for me ? <person> , gim me a little credit , <person> . 
i know she 's sorry she wo n't be seeing you anymore . <person> , she wanted me to take care of you . 
yes . 
i know you 're not talking to me ... 
certainly , <person> <person> , with pleasure . 
and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and <person> that if they put up a hotel they 'd need $ <number> worth of steel net around their beaches ! in new england ? we all lost on that <number> . 
like , i 've always wanted to walk on the moon . 
well , i 'll go in and have a bite . 
i 'm not tired ! 
try . do me a favor . <person> . it 's your only chance . and hers , too . do that for me—and maybe we 'll be friends— maybe . do we understand each other ? 
everybody who can hurt me , everybody who can help me . it pays . 
the only baptism he ever performed in <number> years as pastor at bedford . 
uh , yeah . does she have big hooters ? 
yes . 
exactly when ? 
what about it ? 
do n't worry about it . 
<number> bucks apiece . 
lay it on me . 
are you totally gone ? this is my private home ... 
come and get him . 
hello ? 
see . it 's starting to come back , yeah ? you mind if i take a bath ? 
i thought i was over the dreams for good . i really did . i had n't had <number> for months . 
it 's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days . 
-- and you 've had some fucking meteoric rise , that 's for sure -- by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau -- 
yeah . 
could be risky . 
holy shit ! 
you 're more than that , <person> . they were mistaken about you and they 're trying to show you they know it . they want you back in . 
no , sir , you did not . 
yes , you did . 
you 're an outcast . 
i 'm ... not ... nobody ... 
we got him . 
yeah . i 'm sorry . 
how is he ? 
i intercepted phone calls . 
it was me . he just told me how ... i wish he could tell me now . 
what did he say ? 
can anybody hear me ... 
oh come on , <person> , it was just a contest . 
keep your eye on that brass ring . do n't let anything side-track you . 
admittedly ... 
timmy , let go ! you 're gon na have to let go ! count to <number> . i 'll catch you . 
i 'm sure you mean something by that , <person> , but i do n't know what ... 
you come to the right place . 
yeah , i 'm fine . i just broke up with my boyfriend , that 's all . 
do n't have much choice , <person> . you saw to that ! 
how 've you been ? 
i came up to dance , wadda you think ? you here with somebody ? 
a dull cliche . 
i 've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we 're like these totally rich yuppies ... 
do n't pout now , <person> , it 's a long trip . 
of course i 'm not coming . do i look like i 'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave ? where is it ? the fucking <person> <person> ? ha ! 
there . that 's right . 
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism . i wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as i tried to do something about it , i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell . 
yes ! read the constitution , it 's all in there . and remember -- you do n't know anything , nothing . 
i bet you he 'd know how to say it all right . and me , i get up to it and around it and in back of it , but , but i never get right to it . do you know what i mean ? so the only chance i 've got is , well , if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of , sorta prepare her for the shock ! 
i 'm going to miss you . 
in a bar called hellfire . 
oh yes , i do . 
thank you . it 's not important . 
the manzetti thing must have scared her . she thinks she 'll get implicated . 
i do n't like him . 
do n't go ! please . 
ca n't you stop that ? 
nicole ... 
a dressing bag . 
who was it ? 

what <person> <person> ? 
i was going to a funny movie , but i changed my mind . if you 're depressed , laughing does n't help much . when did you know my father ? 
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ... 
then <number> day they find you . 
mrs. simmonds . 
yes ? 
do you believe in it ? 
the space shuttle has landed ! 
i am on the enterprise . i am also here . think of me as an `` echo '' of the person you know . a part she left behind . 
and ? 
no , it 's no cure . it 's something much more interesting . 
hey ... cy ... what now you a righteous panther man , you too uppity to drink with us ? 
<number> % of the women in this world are named `` liz '' . 
twenty-after-ten . 
what ? 
yah , but i - okay , i would , i 'd guarantee ya your money back . 
here , are n't you gon na let me in . 
i am . 
no , that 's okay . really . 
i do n't know . 
you said , `` you do n't make something up unless it 's sure to help . '' how did you know that i made it up ? 
did you ask <person> ? 
i 'm getting this flickering light on <number> of my panels . 
but she < u > saw < /u > us . i could feel it . 
you remember where you got this eleanor -- ? 
at least you 're doing something ... i 'd give anything to be in your position . 
i only live up there and across the roof . 
oh . i can type up a storm , but i ca n't spell . so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that 's how i met <person> -- oh , <person> , i 'm so fouled up . what am i going to do now ? 
huh ! you turned him into a liability , didn ’ t you know ? 
nesting ? 
i 'm not guaranteeing a thing , <person> <person> . you people work too fast for me ! talk about new brooms ! 
hell of a day for a ballgame , huh , <person> ? 
well -- i guess i 'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what 's -- 
the statue . she had shown it to me the day before . 
i want to speak with you , please . 
i wan na let go . i do ... 
did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way ? 
so , mickey , tell us what you do for fun . 
i understand you 've been dr. <person> 's assistant for quite some time ... he must 've snatched you out of the cradle . 
i thought he 'd never leave . 
... yeah . <person> ' to get most of my day done before it hits nine- ... 
i wonder if <person> 's gotten back . 
yes . 
probably hit by a car . <person> to see things in the twilight . 
give me some bourbon . j. t. s. <person> . 
yes , adulation is a cross to bear . god knows < u > i < /u > know . but someone 's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress mayor and do n't deny it , <person> <person> , you 've got the magic ! 
what 's <person> <person> ? 
who is this , <person> ? 
oh -- yes -- i beg your pardon ! 
i had the impression ... from the model ... that the <number> planets were moving as <number> . that there would be ... a lasting darkness . 
please sit down ... 
is that a threat ? 
what do you want ? 
water ... water ... 
winning . 
you understand what i 'm sayin ' ? 
<number> <number> to <number> , but you pegged it . the toughest shot on the last frame . 
they gone to the field ... 
i have to have a life . i have to do things that i want with people my own age . it 's none of your business who i am going out with . i do n't give a good goddam if you 're angry -- 
so what 's wrong with that ? 
not this again -- 
you still never know what 's going on in anyone 's mind ... 
daddy , <person> was up late last night reading little dirty comic books . <person> gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it , he took the lords name in vain , then claimed he had n't said it . he lied , <person> . 
and tomorrow i 'll give <number> to somebody else . get dressed . get out . 
<person> , holy shit . <person> had it all going on . 
i think that 's highly unlikely , creasy . 
and superstitious too . it 's like witchcraft . 
yeah . 
i 'm not joking . i wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there . at that point and moment , <person> was like a vision of perfection . 
yeah , the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me . 
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard , eh ? her brother ’ s death . 
did you come here to tell me how to run my business ? 
pulls his coat on . honora gives him a peck cheek . 
yeah . 
i bet you make your daddy proud , do n't you ? beautiful . 
who said it was my first time ? 
i do n't think so . you need me alive . 
right . 
<number> <number> street , kids : home . 
go on pussy-eaters ... laugh . you look like you be eatin ' pussy . you got pussy-eatin ' mugs . now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he 's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit . 
they 're gon na give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal 's off ! 
can you give me a realistic idea ... of how long this is going to last ? 
i 'm sorry , i did n't . 
i ca n't really talk right now . 
belle -- 
jesus . 
i 've just been inside the mind of a genius . <person> <person> knows more about war than i could in a dozen lifetimes . 
come on , <person> , let 's go out to the garage . 
this power is divided amongst you , me , and others like cuts in a pie . but the cuts are not equal . some , like you and he , have more . much more . 
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this ? 
why do you ask that ? 
he 's an enemy soldier . 
me too . 
where 's the adm ? where did your uncle put it ? 
but not now . 
put it this way , he 's mislaid him . 
<person> yow ? oh <person> <person> ... ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car . 
no , of course not , but i think now that this has happened , a lot of things can start to come out ... 
do n't you like her ? 
it might be worth a martini to you . 
i 'm not sure . 
i feel right now like there 's <number> burning in me . 
what ? 
excuse me ? 
that all you can say ? 
i know ! he killed <person> ! 
well , if my intentions are what you think they are -- if i do wish to step into your shoes , what then ? i have no other intentions than you had yourself . <person> <person> 's wealth may be great , but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily ? her rank is lofty , but not so lofty as my ambition . i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my <person> <person> as you ever showed her ; and if i win her , and wear her when you are dead and gone , corbleu , knight , do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me ? 
that 's what i said eighteen months ago . 
are n't you a little too young for that , sonny ? 
what time did he get there ? 
i was n't disbarred , they dropped the pro ... 
you better run out to the house . she may be ... unable to answer the phone ... 
well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he 's starin ' at me with these narrow eyes . <person> ' me his mean face . 
at anything . at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life . at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance . if you ca n't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me . 
well you know what i mean . 
it was not inspired by circumstance . 
claire , she 's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you were n't thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong . 
every day . 
so , should i call <person> ? 
so . what happens now ? 
we 're hung up here . <person> . 
<person> said it was all right if i was real quiet . 
why should i ? 
the diplomat ! <person> wakens , startled . 
go right ahead . 
in case ? ? ? ! ! ! in case of what ? in case you stumble on her , suckin ' cock in the front fucking hall ? ! 
that is because it rained recently , the rain has obscured the evidence . but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints , then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are , and that way you could catch him -- understand ? 
you could sue the shit out of her , ya know . that kid belongs under a circus tent , not flippin ' burgers . you could own that fuckin ' place . 
hello ... 
what 'll they do to him ? 
why did you lie to me ? 
the army gave you that ? 
what do you want me to do ? you want me to quit the show ? ! 
i do n't know . everything 's so neat . it 's all just so ... goddamn dear . <person> ! 
it 'll grow on you . 
and he 'll talk ? 
<person> ! 
where were you ? 
<number> pianos is n't enough anymore , <person> . 
the way i run an organization , any man in it has the right to speak his mind . 
hello , <person> ! 
you 're late . i 've got some good news and some good news . i 'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in . 
well , you were pretty great ! 
but if you 're wrong ... 
i 'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at ... say <number> m.p.h . 
alice ... 
yes . 
by the way , laurence , were you here last time your mistress ’ s brother came over ? you know , just before he disappeared ? 

well sir , he 's quite seriously deformed , and i fear the other patients would find him ... rather shocking . 
what happened ? 
<person> does n't burn ... 
your majesty has had many women -- 
may we come in ? 
not if i do n't let her . 
but you do n't realize ... . 
not like your fuckin ' friends out there , that ... without brains . <person> ? 
the men who came to see you at leavenworth . the one 's who made the arrangement ... who were they ? maybe i can talk to them . 
as fair as me ? 
you 're kidding . 
you and <person> , you get all the action . there she is , out in the wild west and everything . 
thank you . so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer . 
what is this ? 
i 'll talk to you later . 
oh , i even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- i know when you were born -- and where -- i know all sorts of things about you . 
so am i. i want to see you again . i want to see you as much as i can before you leave . i said it . 
dr steckler ? 
yes . 
matthew , you do n't have to -- . 
out of ... ? 
it 's a piece of evidence that 's worth a great deal more than that . 
well , when you 're used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges , everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison . 
i 'm so flattered but i ca n't . i 'm grounded . 
hey buddy . you okay ? 
right . <person> <person> . 
how do we know they 've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . . 
every step of the way . 
i did n't -- 
m'sieu laval , i have enjoyed the confidence of this family -- 
leave me alone ! i do n't ever want to see you again ! 
are you ok ? 
i did n't say nothin ' , boss . 
jesus ... maybe white 's not so dumb after all . 
what ? 
that insults them . 
sure . <person> , i hope you know i did n't have to show you that picture . 
what the hell do you think it was about ? there 's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others . 
naturally ? -- that 's not the word i would have chosen . 
what choice do they have ? now they must serve us or starve . 
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source ? 
i want to rehire you . to find out what 's happening to my brother-in- law . 
you 're a better man than i am , <person> <person> . 
not you . 
i 'd rather piss glass . 
what is the common thread between these victims ? 
and when did that pass ? 
you dead yet ? 
<person> <person> , <person> <person> , and <person> `` ram '' sweeney all had good looks and popularity , but there 's <number> thing they did n't have : values , ambition , and hope . 
rajeev , the man who usually works on the building . 
now you know who and what <person> really is . 
is that you , kid ? 
you working on someone right now ? 
it 'll never stick . 
and she 's a knock-out , too . 
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you . i seen you over there follerin ' me . 
any chance of <number> of them confessing someday ? 
yes -- 
that would be murder , <person> <person> . 
i love you , austin . 
what the hell you thinking , girl ? strolling in here this late ? 
we need gas . 
we call it abuildin ' time , <person> . 
sure . it 's all on the q.t. , but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line . 
you want me to come with ? 
it 's a very pleasant room , <person> . 
she 's right ... you lost your temper ... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank . you lost all credibility right there ! 
plasma coils ... is there any way we can use that to our advantage ?

he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health . 
place all alone like that ? must be a boarder check point . 
you knew . you just did n't care .

< u > <person> < /u > you ! he 's coming to kill you ! 
you may not believe this ... but there 's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god . to believe that we 're all here for a purpose , that all this ... means something . but it 's because that part of me wants it so badly that i 'm so stubborn about making sure it is n't just self-delusion . of course i want to know god if there is <number> ... but it has to be real . unless i have proof how can i be sure ? 
not <number> minute longer or <person> will come for you .

i never could believe that <person> was a split personality . i never believed he was a dumper ; and i do n't believe he disappeared of his own volition ; and i do n't believe he 's alive . 
i hope you wo n't take this the wrong way , but i could n't help but notice ... that you 're a dead ringer for veronica lake in `` the blue dahlia '' .

honey .

i need to know where <person> is . ca n't you help me ? 
i shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind ! just when exactly does an actress decide they 're her words she 's saying and her thoughts she 's expressing ? 
he insults him all the time .

i know . it 's like the opposite of inbreeding . the hottest <number> percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool . 
that only leaves the rest . 
the mets . <person> does n't think they 've got a deep enough pitching roster this year , and i 'm inclined to agree . 
what 're you doin ' ? 
they have a right to be ... do you think they 'll help us ? 
why not ? 
i 've got concerns . 
when do you go up ? 
<person> up and change -- i 'm starved .

probably out in the back yard . 
but ellen , i told you i have stopped ... 
jeez , i do n't know where you 're ever going to find a guy like that . 
you mean we learn the rules ... 
no . 
insurance !

i think that you know . 
that 's why there 's a dead <number> on the ship . it ran out of blood . 
<number> bucks ? 
did you change your hair ? 
sadist ! i ca n't believe i thought you could change -- this is your idea of discipline ? you 're a monster . that kid is going to be traumatized for ... 
your kid brother got married last sunday , eh , <person> ? 
catherine , you are very dear to me . we have cried many times together . when my husband died , i would have gone insane if it were not for you . i ask you to come to my house , because i can make you happy . please come to my house .

i 'll regret it even more if i keep you on . 
end of the road , boys . it 's had its twists and turns -

then -- why do n't you leave me -- go to them -- explain 
you could tell <person> was <number> of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place , and that could get a little irritating sometimes , but basically he was a real good guy .

little boy ? ! that 's him ! 
i 'm going home <person> . 
that 's where you 're wrong . i got <number> <number> years ago . i just never had an opportunity to use it . 
<number> gees .

probably because they know a psycho when they hear <number> . 
i want to nail you ass . 
except i ca n't get you out of my head , <person> . 
no . there 's no way ! 
yes , why should n't it ?

you sure seen a lot for a blind man . 
hi . 
i figured i 'd make breakfast . 
fort powell . what do we tell 'em ? 
just give me a minute . 
wet your eyes , boy . stay in there for about <number> minutes .

he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong . he was not acting on mad impulse . he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time . 
<number> dollars ! <person> , i ca n't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza . 
-- but you 're father 's in there ! 
my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles . it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth .

she must have been the one that blew me off with <person> . i guess to get me running . did you tell her about my stash ? 
look , why do you care , huh ? 
you expect me to believe what , that someone came in here last night . gave that guy ... something that stopped his heart ? 
decency ? hey listen , pal ... 
if bienstock catches you again - what 's the matter with you , anyway ?

i ca n't < u > bring < /u > the ghosts . they 're not here ! 
please , just leave . 
you understand what 's going on ? it makes sense , right ?

you were the admitting nurse at st. catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night <person> <person> <person> was admitted ... 
you 'll live . 
you should n't drink so much of that stuff . it 's bad for you . 
had a letter from my wife . the wisteria is still out , which i 'm looking forward to . she says <person> is gripped with <person> <person> . <person> coast i should have thought , still… 
yeah , we 're drunk . we 're the drunks . what 's your name ? 
sneaking in the back door . 
stop that dog !

airport . 
<person> knew about it . tried to tell <person> , get the warriors involved . 
i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you , <person> . i really will not . 
-- of bring -- inadequate -- i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in <number> way -- 
since <person> turned up - food seems to appear , so please . 
it 's not what you think . 
the others ? 
here theo , it 's the fazeli specialty ; a seven-ten split . theo looks down the lane and sees the <number> pins standing . 
i did n't know you were called <person> . 
how 's that ? 
doing the bachelor party thing ? 
you go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick . 
i get this feeling like i 'm ... a magnet but i attract shit . out of all the people in this city , why did i meet a man who 's wife i killed ? 
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ... 
look , mush , you 're the guv'nor here , i can see that , i 'm on your manor now , right . so there 's no need to get out of your pram . i 'm johnny-come-lately to all this . whatever the bollocks between you and this slag <person> , it 's got nothing to do with me . i do n't wan na know . 
not much to see , i 'm afraid . i 'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe . 
how can you be out here ?

get lost , will you ? 
monica . what are you doing here ? 
yeah ... 
<number> years , yeah .

what in the hell ... ? 
it 's possible . 
what have you been before today ? 
what ? what does that mean ? 
and of course to you , my sweet , for your ... moral support . 
i do n't really think you warrant that strong an emotion . 
ha . maybe i should join snl . 
and i 'm a peaceful man , and ... 
well what do you think , we eloped or something ? or we 're living in sin and ... 
mary clarence ! 
you know , i 've always considered myself a very clever girl . <person> . good head on my shoulders , that sort of thing , never the wrong word at the wrong time ... but then , i 'd never met <person> dewitt . i remember once i had a tooth pulled . they gave me some anaesthetic - i do n't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way . i heard myself saying things i was n't even thinking ... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body , and could n't control what i did or said- 
our time 's up . 
no bother . i 'm very grateful for a little company . you see , i suffer from insomnia . 
eight times . 
i guess i do n't know what the hell i 'm talking about . 
killing wildlife not good enough anymore , so you go on to bigger and better things . 
screw you , wood ! i even sunk more money into different titles : `` transvestite '' `` he or she ? '' `` i led <number> lives '' ... it does n't matter ! nobody wants to see the piece of shit . 
you know , i do n't think so . i 'm confused but you know , i do n't think he 'd ever hurt me . i do n't think he 'd hurt anyone . 
you read my book which as you know , hit the stands a couple of weeks ago . you read it yet . 
you should n't go alone . he might claim that you tried to black mail him . 
men , they mostly faggots . 
yeah . 
oh , he 's sitting up . 
<number> earthquakes in <number> weeks is enough . 
eagle ... he hated my guts . <person> did n't like me none . 
on your desk . 
what for ? 
do you have to do that ? 
where you think you 're going ? 
what -- what 's that got to do with me ? i 'm not running any bookie joint . 
i thought she built it herself . 
i wo n't let myself come between you and your father . go home . 
going somewhere ? 
you got a prob- ... 
having kind of a tough time . 
we did it in the office . she thought her apartment was too impersonal . 
you must leave . you were not here this morning . 
after i left ... when i was in california , i began to think , what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child . it got to where i could n't tell anybody about <person> -- i could n't stand that look in their faces when i said he was n't living with me . finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to <person> and to me and to the world how much i loved him ... and i did ... and i won . only ... it was just another `` should . '' ... sitting in that courtroom . hearing everything you did , everything you went through ... something happened . i guess it does n't matter how much i love him , or how much you love him . i guess it 's like you said , the only thing that counts is what 's best for <person> . i do n't know , maybe that 's all love is anyway ... ted , i think <person> should stay with you ... 
alright , but i ai n't drinking . and you 're gon na have to look after me . 
<person> colet , i 've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than <number> years . i was a school friend of your husband 's ... 
well , your uncle was chairman of the board of directors . they probably expect you to carry on . 
i told <person> all we had was a boatload of children but we 're the only ship in the quadrant . spock : those cadets of yours -- how good are they ? how will they respond under real pressure ? 
really , what kind was it a mair or guilding ? 
... honestly ... 
such as ?

leary ? 
and they do n't even know what it really is . 
i do n't think so . 
where are these toys of yours ? 
they 've been coming in steady all morning . i have called for some extra police . 
fifteen seconds . perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney . 
you 're feeling old and you want to start exercising . a lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth . do n't feel embarrassed about it . 
i do n't know . <person> has a concert in athens next month -- and he 's asked if i want to go along , help out . he says goodbye by the way -- he 's in rehearsal , otherwise -- 
it's-it 's got bad plumbing and bugs . <person> , i'll-my accountant will write it off as a tax deduction , i 'll pay for it .

what did he look like ? 
somebody called me , <person> . i 'm not making it up . 
these are the ground rules . i hook up with <number> guy a season -- i mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training ... and , well , you <number> are the most promising prospects of the season so far . so ... i thought we should get to know each other . 
moonby what ? 
i 'm getting used to it . where are we ? 
and you came here to what ? to comfort me ? 
limpet bomb . <person> , very compact . from trubshaw 's . 
-- <person> , on the other hand , had made an enemy of this man <person> . 
the mantan manifesto . <person> ai n't it ? number one . we gainfully employ african americans , in front of and behind the cameras . <number> . let the audience decide . three . who put these critics in charge ? these so-called cultural police ? <number> . who determines what is black ? <number> . <person> is a satire . six . if they ca n't take a joke , `` f '' 'em . 
i walked right past you . 
dear , you 're a scientist . do n't you believe your own eyes ? 
you should always work with a spotter . 
do n't be a baby . you 're tougher than that . 
we were gon na grab some food . 
that 's what you look like . 
no , never before . i 've fallen into lakes , out of rowboats , when i was a little girl . and i fell into a river , once , trying to leap from <number> stone to another . but i 've never fallen into <person> <person> <person> . have you ? ever before ? 
it could be nothing . 
i told him you were my boyfriend .

i 'm looking for a great warrior . 
front page ? 
hey , sir , it was a pleasure to preserve <person> 's ass . well ... you know what i mean . 
well -- i am worried about the way you 've changed . that was <number> thing you said you 'd never do -- remember ? 
he was drunk . <person> as a lord . 
what do you think you 're doing ? 
<person> stevens ? 
the sacrifices i 've made because of that man . he 's ruined me with his ego , his philandering , his -- his-his-his-his mediocrity ! 
so ? 
considering your financial circumstances , <person> <person> , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better <number> . 
and in return ? 
i suppose you do n't think that 's funny ? 
what are you looking at ? 
marlon -- 
my husband has convinced me of the contrary . 
sometimes we 're forced to make hard decisions . i 'd like for us to stay together , <person> . you know , platonically , if that 's possible . i truly value our friendship . 
last night . do you know something ? 
because ... he wanted to them to be punished . 
be careful who sees it . 
obviously . 
<person> ? in less than a week you 're prancing about the country like a squirrel .

there was a third man - he did n't give evidence . 
yes —— yes , if she made that much impression on you , i 'm sure it was <person> . 
then why do you come to me ? 
but i 'm surprised you 're still working for her , unless she 's suddenly come up with another husband . 
my purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it . 
thanks . you read my mind . third watch always seems to last forever . 
you 'll know presently . at the meeting of the society . but until then , i beg of you <person> , keep it to yourself . 
they asked who it was . 
it 's all right gorgeous . something wrong ? 
we 're on the move . let 's go . as they walk toward a corridor .

a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties , <person> . i think you 're referring to the pink panther .

wo n't those <number> years in court be expensive for you ? i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people , but now ... 
great . 
you coming to south america ? 
you hurt my feelings . i ought to raise the price to be a thousand . 
what the hell is this ? who are you ? 
you 're on leave , man . you 're on psycho leave . i 'm talking to a possible whacko here . 
-- offer me everything i ask for -- 
well , here i am . see ? 
... when did you know all this ? 
very clumsy , very clumsy . i ’ d have found it in a minute . 
goodnight , <person> . 
bring her to starboard . 
i do n't eat waffles . 
too right , youth . that 's why i need you to lead the troops . 
i do n't see how i can , and i ca n't prove any of this . i got all this information illegally . also it could get you in trouble . 
it 's ok . there 's no problem . 
that 's not like you , <person> . just the other day , at the staff meeting , i was telling <person> <person> what a reliable man you were . 
i 'll never forget you as long as i live , sergeant .

you 're going after her in that ? you 're crazy ... it 'll take all day in that bathtub ... . 
is it something you 've done ? 
do n't be cruel . 
what happened to your hair ? 
look -- why would the republicans do it ? -- my god , mcgovern is self- destructing before our eyes -- just like <person> did , humphrey , the bunch of 'em . why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught ? why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off , unless they wanted to get caught ? why would they use mccord -- the only direct contact to the republicans ? 
they 're making him a hero now . 
you both know if you do this , if you go after a senator 's son and you 're wrong ... it 's not just me in the hot seat anymore .

it appears as though <person> has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings . and he is using <person> as its core . 
i do n't need to be a hero , laplante , but i ca n't face people ... the looks in their eyes ... after the trust they gave me !

we 're closed , sir . 
he 'll eat potroast and like it . 
or you will do what , mrs. marshall ? but i admire your courage . your husband , on the other hand ...

mmmm-hmm . <person> 's the , uh , 'dragon 's lair ? ' where do you live ? 
just hold on buddy boy . 
do n't do that . 
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven <number> miles that day . where did she go ? i have to know , <person> . where she goes and what she does , before i got involved with doctors . 
mr <person> ... 
torture cage . ca n't stand ... ca n't sit ... for days . sometimes weeks . 
so you really think she means you 're going with her ? 
yeah , only i figure you 'd be the <number> doing the speaking . 
pornos . 
we were in <number> h together . we 've known each other since childhood . so , i 'm handling the sales part . he 's my silent partner and he knows if i get fucked up , i wo n't drop dime on him . i did n't tell you nothin ' and you did n't hear nothin ' .

wedding . wedding . you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row . 
you see where it 's coming in ? 
take her up to the suite . have a glass of champagne ... or <number> ... i 'll be up in a while to help you ring in the new year . 
georgia , where i come from , it 's real if you make it yourself . but i been buying from the yankee government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate . 
yes . yes . i think so . i hope you 'll be comfortable . i 'm putting you up at my ... 
i 'm not gon na kill him . shut the fuck up . what , do you know what you 're talkin ' about ? i 'm not killing anyb- 
mozart , you are not the only composer in vienna . 
i 'm sure it 's not for a lack of looking . maybe i should get a real complete physical . you give <person> an annual , do n't you ? 
so i just heard her cries for help and all that , and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there , so i just stood around really , waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs . and that 's about all , i think . i did n't actually see anything useful , i do n't think . 
there are no twos , <person> . 
suck me , beautiful ! 
you 're the pathetic <number> , not me . 
know what a turtle is ?

oh , you crumb . with that fifteen hundred i coulda beat him . that 's all i needed , <person> . 
what 're you gon na do ? 
and was there anything of value in the car ? 
it was insane here , man . <number> call in the national guard . then i did my laundry ... watched <number> . 
your directive apparently does n't include spying on other cultures . 
and the girl i love , she hates `` heaven . '' if i keep it , she 'll never respect me . 
i 'll beat him the next game . 
yes , sir , it 's here on the truck , but it 's pretty heavy -- i 'll need help . 
so you 're going to do this ? 
whoever hired us . 
he are here ! he have arrived ! <person> ! 
it was to the same woman . i was just a kid ... it 's not like a marriage proposal or anything , just a thought . something for you and me to talk about and think about . you know ? 
longbranch ... ? 
pg & -- are you sure ? 
maybe i want to die . do n't you want me to die ? 
what happened , pilgrim ? 
a coin 's got <number> sides . when you flip it there 's a fifty-fifty chance it 'll be heads or tails . <person> thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it 'll come up each side . 
bela . i just wan na thank you again for last night . 
there 's only you , <person> . you know what , <person> ? you 're beautiful . i love you so much ... you need ... 
if you do n't hang around in this circle , no reason it should . 
-- saved your ... whaaaaaaat ? what ? blackmailing ... ? 
that guy rules !

do they have such thoughts ? 
not according to the men in blue . 
i do n't remember ... anyway , <person> 's okay ... 
now do n't that call for an extra ! 
looks like they damaged the silo ... 
yes . i 'm waiting for my lunch . 
allow a man his version of the past . when you get to be my age , you 've got enough painful memories , you 're allowed to soften a few of the edges up . 
yeah , actually , i do . but <person> does n't . at least not right now . 
i 've lost interest . 
well , what do you have for me today ? 
mortality 's actually a great thing to be familiar with . it means you 're sane on some level . 
i do n't want to go tonight . 
knock it off , damone . i need real help . 
i think she 's going to be all right . 
you 're shaking . are you nervous ? 
yeah . it did n't make any sense . 
he was creepy . 
<person> 's not buying up his memorabilia . he keeps it all in his `` mind , '' do you see ... ? 
you rich ? 
what is it ? 
thanks for the lovely evening , shithead ! 
she did n't say . maybe she 's at the bar at the hotel . 
how ? 
pretty much . all except the latent homosexuality part-that 's just my theory . 
hopefully no one . 
but there is no pattern . there 's no connection at all among these places , or the computers would 've nailed it ! they 're even found in random order . 
it 's coming -- i rode on ahead . i have to speak with the captain of the english army ... his name 's <person> ... 
in a couple of days this whole thing -- 
come in . 
i 'm dr. hoffman , <person> <person> . 
<person> burdon , please . <person> <person> . 
well , i 'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear .

next you 'll be sick . 
hell yes , all <number> and seventeen of 'em ! 
i 'm sorry , sir , i was only- 
who ? 
good <number> , <person> <person> . he does look like a you-know-what . 
dogs got no reason to live . 
with respect , <person> , many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes . maybe he 's just unlucky . 
once you pick it up you ca n't put it down . 
a carpet cleaning company ? 
then let me go . you do n't need me . 
grazie , mio caro , <person> ! 
-- but he does seem very nice . 
i do n't see why we got ta lie 'bout it when you and i know this ai n't gon na work .

stop busting my hump ... . 
so far , ye-yes . 
i had an accident - i fell down stairs ... 
that 's what he said . he told me he lived with his mother and father on east seventy-fourth street . 
yes . packed and with an inventory . 
umm , he 's going to make it is n't he ? 
ray ! where are you ? are you all right ?

anne , prepare yourself for the treat of your life . this is <person> . 
they did what ? ! i do n't understand . why 'd they go into o'brien 's office in the first place ? 
you provoke me , merlin . 
oh yes . i thought he was a medical photographer , doing some sort of accident research . he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash . 
me ? oh , uh . no . 
good . 
jawohl . 
'is it really me ? ' 
lucky i was there to save you . 
no . not remotely . i just want to find out about him . 
doctor , it may sound odd , but i believe i 've profited from my stay here . it 's just what i 've needed , to get away like this . but i 'm recuperated now . i 've had lots of time to think and i 've made a few decisions about my life . i 'm ready to get on with it . 
in birmingham . 
lions and tigers and bears ! 
oh , many things ... 
norman ! 
what month ? 
stay with him . 
on what ? another job ? 
what ? 
that 'll make up the difference , huh ?

something seems to have happened to my self-respect . 
no way is that the same chick . the other one was a dog . 
yes . 
i do n't see him . 
your lover . 
okay , okay ! okay . 
you mean a figurehead . 
you knew enough to tell <person> that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life -- 
i 'm getting the jitters ! let 's turn back ! 
great . and your all set for the performance ? 
that 's always tough . how long were you together ? 
i just talked to her on monday . we still hang out on weekends .

romeo and juliet . i cried at the end . 
and you could care less -- 
i delivered it . 
... interview every employee , support staff , associates , partners . <person> < u > any < /u > of them know <person> was sick ? < u > how < /u > did they know ? did he tell them ? did they notice something was wrong with his appearance ? none of this information got to the managing partners . we know that . make sure everyone else does too ... and <person> : i want to know everything about his personal life . did he frequent those pathetic bars on <person> <person> ? 
fine , thank you , but 
huh ?

how could i know what else i forgot ? 
he loves you very much . he just --

well ? 
i do n't know ! nothing ! 
hey , you can ’ t park that thing here . 
sure did . i 'll tell you , if that man was any better looking it 'd be a crime 'a some sort ... 
what makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with <number> ? he wants it all , <person> -- that means we 're in his way , too . 
well . it appears someone 's been lying to us . 
that 's a-no good . you got ta insult somebody from another country . look -- i come from <number> country . you come from another country . i say something you do n't like . you say something i do n't like - and i 'm insulted . 
you know that 's not true . 
where the hell are they ? hope they did n't wise up . 
my god . 
do n't know what ? 
bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go . found him in an old boiler room , just like before . saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore , drunk an ' asleep with his weird knives by his side ... 
you lived in the states for a while ? 
the baby ? 
there is no pocketbook here ... on the floor probably . 
look , it was just a job . nothing personal , ya know ? i play my part , improvise a little . that 's what i 'm good at . 
that 's <number> words . and i 'm out of the `` exposed '' business , remember ? i need to graduate . besides , <person> 's a boy scout . 
oh death where is thy sting-a-ling ? grave where thy victory ? 
go ahead . 
how much is about <number> and a half <number> divided by <number> ? 
hey , are you hungry ? i 'm hungry . 
off limits . 
from his father , of course . 
that 's a secret . 
yes . 
oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute ! 
do n't you have anywhere to go ? 
shit ! <person> , what is that ? 
the case is closed . <person> . <person> 's given us a full confession . get your ass back to <person> <person> . 
man is man , all he knows is man , and all he can think of is what he knows . the anthropomorphic problem . <person> , norman . 
there 's a <number> places to hide around here . 
c'mon , man ... my `` demise ... '' overreaction 
why did he do that , reckon . 
business . 
yeah . 
what the hell kinda cop are you ? ! 
look , <person> , just be patient . i 'll fix everything . you do n't want that cat , anyway . it killed <number> people . 
what ? 
maybe it 's the way i look . or the sound of my name . 
that watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me . it meant the world to me . 
what do you want me to do , zoe ? i 'll do whatever you want . 
we used to take baths together . 
well , that 's good news , my boy . 
it 's me . `` <person> <person> . '' 
nothing financial . strictly personal . i can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where i 'm concerned . a foreigner , showing up unexpectedly , like . 
i mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place ? 
you < u > might < /u > be handsome . i ca n't tell through all that grime . besides , you reek of sweat and horses . 
what ? 
<person> president , the probe has passed through all quadrants . the starships <person> and <person> and <number> smaller vessels have been neutralized . 
but i was n't here , <person> <person> . honest i was n't . . . 
what 's that ? 
easy , <person> . 
what club ? 
what 're you thinking , <person> ? 
ca n't you tell ? 
look , i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field . 
yes , you do . you have to go rescue all those people ... 
pish posh , <person> <person> . i 'm not your aunt tilly . 
afraid ... of what ? 
not this one . and not mitchell . 
what do you mean , a part of <person> ? 
and those are <person> 's and mine . 
but if you did n't rebuild the time machine , how did i go back in time in the first place ? 
tommy , before you go , i wonder if you gim me a little advice . 
what do you mean ? 
listen , <person> , we 've got a problem . it 's cole . 
from the psychiatric end . 
with her family . <person> 's mother died yesterday . 
ben where do you have to get to ? 
... if that 's the way you wan na put it . 
very funny . 
dead bodies . the ones in the lincoln are your ... associates . 
<person> kane , how can i persuade you - 
i 'm tryin ' to find my jacket . 
please do n't hug me in public again , o.k . ? 
what street ? 
yeah ! we 're hot entertainment , right ? you got me and <person> on tv ... we 're entertainment you sell , right ? 
they 're not speaking . professor <person> had him grounded . 
what is it ? 
if you change your mind about the cocktail party , or anything else , give me a buzz . 
you 'll get <person> killed . 
maybe i could help ya if ya told me his name . 
what did you see ? what did it look like ? 
uh , hello ? 
i reckon . 
i only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the `` rare and unparalleled opportunity '' to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in texas , i believe . said i could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when i questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it 's sad . so few men do . 
<person> , it 's me . 
mckendrick 's men got him . 
you goin to shoot yourself ? 
well ... you got your parts , you got your labour ... let 's call it a hundred-fifty bucks . 
what ? she threw me out , remember . she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn . only we did n't make it . she ca n't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in . 
you 're supposed to call me when you lose your job early . i stopped by the mirror factory today , you left quite a mess behind there . 
book ? 
the key lime is great , but it 's an acquired taste . 
why 'd you have to say fifty ? why not thirty-five or thirty-nine ? 
yes , i 'm listening . 
i see . 
let 's get back and call this in . 
fergus . 
todd , what 's the matter ? 
i would . 
you go . i do n't want to get dressed yet . come back though . come back . you know , you look so relaxed , like a completely different person . 
now there 's a couple even remarking about your sign , and see how easily you forgot them ? 
what are they ? 
see , man . <person> fuckin takes care of you when you 're in . beats cleaning carpets . 
leave him behind ! 
or arrived with her . 
black . <person> . 
should n't you pay the cabbie ? 
you sing . all the time . 
this could be it . 
how many ? 
rose , are you all right ? are you sick or something ? 
shut up . 
i was trying to be smooth . but at twelve-fifteen i was gon na come over there and talk to you . 
who gives a fuck ! i 'm a businessman . you gon na do me , then do me and shut you 're face ! 
what do you mean ? 
lovey ... <person> might be still alive when you 're in a high school ... and that 's a very long time . 
you mean smashed ! she called up at midnight last week . talking a bunch of crap . <person> ca n't stand her . 
is everything ok ? 
woody , what are you doing under the bed ? 
the ozone must be fully depleted on <person> <person> . 
yes . 
do you know what his budget was ? 
paulie ! 
i know you 're not . 
are you sure all her signatures are real ? it 's not easy to get all those signatures . 
is there a mrs. joshua ? 
... but we should n't have fired him ... 
i caught up with <person> in nogales . he did n't like the idea of comin ' back across the border but he came . i turned him over to the sheriff and -- that 's the story . 
i want to find out what 's wrong with the salesman 's wife . does that make me sound like a madman ? 
i do n't feel much . 
yes . 
now i 'll bet it has his home address there , too 
it 's my belief that <person> was doing exactly what she 'd been doing for years . besides , the school board 's insurance on <person> is minimal . a few <number> at the very most . the really deep pockets are to be found in the town , or in the company that made the bus . 
i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket ! 
you will . 
i know <person> . 
hey , <person> -- i think you better get out now . 
i waited ... i would have fucking waited ... 
do n't even joke about that ! 
and the fear you showed at our last session ? how did you overcome that ? 
a change of plans ? 
you ? ! how about me ? 
we are not talking jokey understatement here , <person> . we 're talking actionable harassment . <number> phone calls a night , hanging around outside my house ... 
i just want you to like me . 
why do you think he took his gloves off ? 
hey , you know me . 
hullo lad . what a surprise , good to see you . 
for what ? 
well , i have to tell you ... i think i 've fallen in love with you . 
a new comedy . by <person> <person> ! 
what do you mean ? 
it looks old . did you get it a long time ago ? 
you okay ? 
it 's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv . 
<person> pomponi is on the telephone , sir . 
let them try . you 'll never find me . i 've already gotten away with murder before . for instance , <person> <person> . 
red dragon . 
not the maxine ? 
when are you gon na let that go , <person> ? when my mom left my dad -- i just accepted it . this is the way it is . she 's not coming back . 
c'mon , man , i 'm just asking for <number> superbowl ring . 
will . 
<number> . 
sure , they did stuff , but nothing like this , <person> . <person> <person> , the break-ins , the enemies list . you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution , planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace , trying to slip lsd to <person> <person> . 
you could knock on the door , you know , and i 'd open it . 
i never said i was n't upset . of course i 'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it was n't some `` symptom '' of something ... 
well , you look it . you win ? 
what 's inside ? 
low tide at cable junction is <number> p.m . 
you 're not . where is it ? 
what are you talking about ? 
put a tap on her phone . 
<person> hound ? 
isabelle ? i need to talk to <person> ... 
sure honey , what 's the hurry ? 
no . yes . i mean , depends on -- 
who ? 
did he ever marry the girl ? did he ever go exploring ? 
did your voices tell you that ? you told me you had n't heard them for months ... 
no . no , wait a minute . we stopped at a porno store . 
that makes it unanimous . i feel all right too . 
i have my reasons . 
i 'm worried.. we have n't had our ... . 
it 's all right . trust me . do n't move . 
he must be very nice . 
you 're not gon na win . 
loser . 
would you just try him ? you never know . as long as i 'm here . you never know . 
oh , grow up . 
a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and -- 
right here . 
i do n't feel very festive . 
i 'm sorry . 
i suppose he 's fixing it up - i know i 'd never get that through . 
do you know what year it is ? 
you can ride like that ? 
i 'll have to run your card off now . 
that is none of our business . but you bring me something for the next edition if it 's only a recipe for spaghetti ! 
i still do n't understand why you keep her around . 
i do n't understand . what about you ? 
i was here ... as a kid . i think you were here , too . but you ... looked just like you look now . 
are you all right ? 
anything i might know about ? 
sometimes . <person> . 
see . 
he 'll learn . 
i must have nothing . their my husband 's . 
gummy and <number> cops ... 
the tower , yes -- <person> , have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you 're from ? 
in my personal observation , i think that more people are neat than are clean ... 
he 's company . 
not too fast . 
... aconite get it dat cheap . 
i wanted to speak with you about ... 
now i 'm sorry . i appreciate your efforts . but i do n't need anybody to help me button my pants - i 've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right , and i can button 'em with <number> hand as a matter of fact . 
down to the wire ? 
it was , i tell you ! 
because i do n't have to . the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism ' or alien ship . and by the way , they call it <person> now . 
never heard of it . 
by letting me help you . 
they ran the residue you scraped from both crispers ' front doors . it 's a combination of plumber 's putty and rayophene gum . <person> almost completely away when you light it . 
yes , it would . 
oh , maybe nickel and dime stuff . 
he fixes the cable ? 
elena . <person> <person> , am i right ? 
next week ? the week after ? 
how 'd it go ? 
you 're <number> tough cookie , <person> <person> . you keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round . 
what are those things ? 
yeah . i want it . 
tunnel ? 
i 'm tired , <person> . go to bed . 
what is it ? 
i want to , palmer -- more than anything . but it has to be real . it has to be true . 
no thank you . 
we dedicate ourselves daily anew . something like that . 
that 's not it . my dad told me not to go . 
yeah , for the last time , i hope . i 'm done with this freak show . i 'm moving back to the real world . 
next week . 
i warned them , <person> . i told them to leave us alone . 
did you like it , dear ? 
hey . i said what i saw . <number> kids arguing . a guy and a girl . 
yeah . 
c'mon , i 'll buy you a drink .

i do n't understand , <person> . you have n't done anything asinine this week . are you not feeling well ? 
what about her ? 
i assure you that wo n't be necessary . we were only trying to help ... 
i did n't say i would . but we 've got to have money . 
why were the other <number> women killed ? 
i think he said a `` curl . '' 
funny . i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning . 
i know , <person> . 
well , id'n that nice . 
so . these people live on the same streets . it 's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up . the regular bums are n't poor enough for you , you got ta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks . 
i wish i could believe that . 
really , sailor , it ai n't nothin ' against you . i love you . 
what happened ? 
i 'm sorry . i 'm just not in the mood for company right now . here . take this map . i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city . i think we should stay off the interstates . we 're too conspicuous . 
i 'd like to hear that data , <person> . 
now look at this fine example of early hindu art ... i do n't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ... 
<person> cabell . and guess who his brother is ? 
angel ... 
who the hell is this ! ? 
fine . i 'm fine . how are you ? 
<person> i 'm late .

<person> -- 
and what happened ?

i got the item . 
oh , why could n't i be the cardinal in charge of catering ... . if the mayflowers get the <number> sections of <person> <person> 's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine -- aie-yi -- do we got anything ? what of <person> , <person> 's friend , where is his loyalty ?

what ? you have to get to a boat right away ! 
i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me , <person> . i 'll accept your resignation .

this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority ?

nor will there be . my husband does not negotiate with terrorists . 
um ... they gave me a limo , uh ... 
where do you think we came from ? 
but ... the king -- my king -- did n't he pay my ransom ? 
i , i do n't mean to sound insensitive . i understand your situation . but there 's nothing i can do . you just called the wrong person , that 's all . i hear there are a bunch of therapists in new york . maybe you should call <number> of them . 
i 'm happy i amuse you . 
mom ? 
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries , <person> <person> ? 
well yes , we 're pruning away some of the dead wood , but if --

<person> isley . i was so attracted to her i could n't reason clearly . i still ca n't . she used to work for <person> <person> . find a file . 
hello ? 
why not ? you 're the secretary of war , are n't you ? 
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman 's room when she 's alone . 
but do n't worry , i 'm clean as a whistle . i only did s & m. no blow jobs . no screwing . 
it 's going to be all right , jake . it 's going to be all right . do n't be afraid . i 've got you now . 
i 've never ridden in an automobile . 
christ , i do n't want to see her take a fall . she thinks i do , but ... 
yes it does . 
you kiddin ' ? they try to get me drunk .

coffee ? nah , i got ta go . 
<number> ? 
are you in the book ? 
what sort of car ? 
i am sorry . i only felt ... it seemed she was harming you . i meant ... 
<number> a.m . 
yesterday i read that <person> was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in '36 , <person> suggested it . had he accepted , he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america . 
you hear something ? 
how is central these days ? 
jesus , is it <number> years ? i got ta quit right now . 
vicky -- do you think , maybe ... it 's time for us to take the next step in our relationship ? 
i do n't have anyone else to give this to , somerset , you know that . and nobody 's going to swap with you . 
i ca n't say anything , i 'm sorry . 
your excellency , you requested some specimens of my work . here they are . i do n't have to tell you how much i need your help . i truly appreciate your looking at these . i have pressures on me - financial pressures . as you know , i 'm a married man now . 
okay then . i 'll do it .

no . 
is this some kind of sick stunt ? let me guess . you want money , right ? 
well , had n't it ? 
it 's you and mom that need to talk . 
what are you listening to , chicken ass ? 
yeah . 
frank ? 
claire ? 
sh-sh-sh— ! soft pedal , you mug ! —before i— what 're you trying to do ? tell the whole world about it ! now listen , you 're in this thing—and you 're staying in ! get me ? you know too much . 
do n't lie to me . what 's your name ? 
over a girl ? 
yeah . it was terrible . 
no . 
i made <number> rule for myself when this started and i realized i was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports ... 
by <person> 's hammer , dr. lazarus , i- 
it 's me or you , ai n't it , <person> ? 
my name 's mccall . i 'm unarmed . 
the thing is , i 'm responsible for the way he 's acting . it 's the nightmare juice . it 's got to be . 
i do n't know ... what are you looking up ? 
your father ... 
well , what 's the difference , anyway ? 
what is it ? 
i could 've . but he did n't want me to . 
i know who he is n't . not c.i.a . not sense/net . but ... money comes in . doors open . he 's onto something . 
look , look , look , look , canada , okay ... ? our neighbor to the north , alla sudden , transformed , into that place , where , like the north wind , < u > <person> < /u > comes ... 
yes . 
yeah ? 
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles . 
of course . 
what does he want that bloody great country place for ? 
uh-huh 
what was that ? 
did n't you hear me , grandpa ? or you got your hearing aid turned down ? 
and that 's what you 've heard ? 
i told you , that 's a secret . 
i hope to score big there myself . i 'm mostly going to be doing the slots . 
what the hell ? 
no . 
release first safety . 
you freed it , son ? 
and it 's this place . it makes no sense , but it spooks me . 
'scuse me , partner , but that 's a ghetto knock . 
i 'm sorry , but do i know you -- 
used to be , things were bad . no job ... no money ... no girl . now i got all that and i 'm crazy too . 
i do n't believe it . 
they 'll understand us , all right ! 
i had to ride my bike here . my behind is killing me . 
i know . 
maybe -- 
hello , can i have room <number> . 
how long you been standing there ? 
raymond - 
have n't you heard what i said ? 
i do n't know anything ! 
-- you can and you will . 
there is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid . what defines you in the landscape , <person> ... ? what anchors your life ... ? your work ... ? your creativity ... ? 
tell me about the ottos . 
after all that i 've done for that fuck ! and he wants to be with that slut ? fine ! he can have his slut ! 
you 're left-handed , are n't you , <person> ? 
extraordinary ! 
he hired you . that was a mistake . 
not today . besides , i think the director of the museum is expecting you . 
no , this is great . 
not exactly , sugar ... <number> reason we 're in all the trouble we 're in right now is cause of what i was doin ' ... i tried to tell you this before ... 
<person> city ? 
will you take me ? 
why do you want to see it ? 
if you were the president , would n't that put a little piss in your shoes ? 
help meee ! 
<person> , <person> . a die for a die . 
i know this sounds weird , <person> <person> , but the department of <person> <person> 's computer shows only <number> blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of <person> <person> ' pupils . 
what are you talking about ? 
what did he say ? 
why did they do all this for <person> ? -- what were they after ? 
all television does is teach children that it 's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day . 
sir , may i quote general order <number> : <number> the approach of any vessel , when communications have not been est -- 
i get my hostage first . no one 's turned loose until i say so . 
but i mean really ... wonderfully ... great . 
commander , i must speak to you . it is a matter of supreme importance ... we are thermians from the klatu nebula , and we require your help . i beseech you to come with us , back to our ship . a great many lives hang in the balance ... 
no , we do n't . 
what ! 
did you ever think , did you think , after he escaped , he would come after you ? 
okay , lieutenant dish . i guess she 's already ... involved with somebody here . 
no . 
ya hope i do n't keep acting like a whore or i 'll turn into <number> , right ? 
i envy you , jerome . 
that mrs. <person> left at <number> ayem yesterday with her husband ? 
what 's so great about new york ? i mean , it 's a dying city . you read `` death in venice . '' 
what 's he going to say ? 
order them to surrender , and i promise you wo n't be court- martialed . 
great . 
you got it . 
we certainly did . 
reprieve . 
stacy , did <person> ever mention a man named <person> <person> ? or <person> <person> ? do you think she could 've had a friend you did n't know about ? 
hide quickly ! 
this is real , i 'm not making it up ! theo , you saw it ! you were there -- the banging and last night . you , you all saw the painting ! 
found what ? 
forgiveness . 
i have n't done any posse work since last time i rode with <person> <person> at the old <person> <person> -- aged <number> , if you 're interested , 
what do you mean ? you 're <person> . 
oh , i do n't care , i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and it 's pissing me off . 
i guess i just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and i just , i just -- 
that 's right . 
smells like something crawled in there and died . 
the head 's okay , but i could sink a six-pack . 
i want to ask you a question . 
but , i 'm here . 
millions , <person> -- and sexual favors . 
i do n't know . i just did n't wan na win like this . 
how are you , <person> ? 
well ... for a start ... er ... there 's no killing ... 
they twisted my arm . 
like a marriage made in heaven ? 
half my life is over , and i have nothing to show for it . i 'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper . i 'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a <number> tons of raw sewage . 
this is from the highest authority ? 
how do you know ? 
i do n't think i can go on , sir . 
what do you think ? 
<number> , almost <number> years . 
pop , stop lying . 
i did what i thought was right . 
oh sure , he figured it was easier to die of thirst ? come on , sombody must 've chased him up there . 
nothing . 
i guess -- about my future . 
i do n't know why . 
reverend edwards . <person> <person> . you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year . 
i 'm not sure i know it . 
you 're picking up my lingo , hon . 
hollis . <person> <person> . 
lies ? 
oh , <person> ... 
why did you wait ? 
who ? <person> and <person> ? 
what 's that you 're playing with , boy ? 
so all of our intel was bogus to begin with . 
you can not kill what is already dead . 
well , well , well . <person> ? 
if you want ... i can take you back to town now . 
no . 
almost did n't recognize you with your hair like that . how you been ? 
here 's a fresh one . why you ? your colleague <person> <person> says <person> wo n't speak to anyone else . that seems oddly possessive behavior to me . 
jake . you can call me jake . here and there . 
i 'm training to ... . 
sounds like another <number> of your stories to me . 
it 's been known to happen . 
did you kill anyone ? 
do we need anything else ? 
wait a minute ! she 's right ! kryptonite . i remember reading about it in an interview with him . nuts ... 
no ... but ... 
i ca n't wait to tell <person> <person> about all my experiences . i 've learned so much . 
i can see <person> 's point . 
especially now . 
that 's not much time . i 'll just slow you down . i have to sleep . i 'm very tired . and i have to wash and eat . you do n't ... 
there she is ! you 'll find <person> <person> in that box . 
i know she must be a really passionate person . 
good heavens no . that 'd create the very worst impression . you must be optimistic . you must convince them . you know as well as i do that the merger must go through . 
whose son this is , whose wife that is . a fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time . good night . 
okay . and you know what , i 'll swing by my place , grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours ... <person> 's that ... would that be a good thing . 
you 've got ta be kidding ? 
-- permanently ? 
did you ? where ? 
at an operation ? 
in this barracks ? 
oh , do n't play it small , <person> . it do n't look good on you . 
but look at rites look at this ! i 'm a nun ! i 'm invisible ! i 'm a penguin ! 
thank <person> - <person> ! you 're wounded . 
uh-huh . 
... <person> ? 
i 'm going back to the lodge , <person> . still need to go through some of kay connell 's school records . 
so what 's the prognosis , <person> <person> ? minus or plus ? 
where is <person> ? 
well , if the guy is far , in a car , and i know weather is going to be bad , rain for example , i think i would plastic the car , with a remote here . i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic . 
i was gon na be in that <person> <person> movie , you know -- with <person> and deniro . got <number> callbacks . 
not a thing . 
a loan officer ? 
whattya mean ? 
i have been ... afraid . afraid ... they will hate me ... because i am so very ugly ... and they are so very beautiful 
you do n't just sign up to be a police officer -- it 's about <number> years of training -- ok ? 
was it a boyfriend of yours ? 
i never agreed to that . 
it 's only my favorite song . it 's <person> <person> doing `` superstar '' by the carpenters . 
i do n't know . 
wallowing quite literally in blood . 
no . ca n't pretend that much . 
the master is not yet married . nor do i think he ever will be . we are simply his servants . 
what are you trying to communicate ? tell us . 
not exactly light reading , i know . believe it or not , i 've read this since high school , and it got me all the way through law school . besides , there 's something in there that 'll help you . you wo n't have to get very far , it 's near the beginning . 
how many ? 
it 's probably nothing , but even if it is , it 's no skin off our teeth . the man at hot dog world is a friend , in the bureau . 
no one has seen a shark -- no fin , no bites , nothing . be realistic . 
what if he does n't like me ? 
evidence of what ? 
why now , <person> ? 
esprit de corps -- 
why ? because of the pain i feel now ? i have regrets <person> , but i do n't regret a singel day i spent with her . 
where 's <person> now ? 
and what did you say ? 
back from where ? 
if they 've sent that little shmuck baum again , i 'm gon na be real pissed off . 
i do n't wear a white wig , i do n't carry a gavel . 
hell , now 's the time to buy it off him cheap . 
that thunder 's sure somethin ' . 
well , are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke . 
<person> . you asked . 
-- listen : `` november <number> , <number> . <person> <person> walked into <number> precinct . says he witnessed chin shooting , saw suspect 's picture in post . says <person> <person> <person> wrong man . '' 
sure , you got drunk . that 's the best excuse in the world for losing . no trouble losing when you got a good excuse . and winning ! that can be heavy on your back too . like a monkey . you drop that load too when you got an excuse . all you got ta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself . it 's <number> of the best indoor sports : feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all , especially the born losers . 
<person> <number> . <person> . 
laplante ! 
no , no i think it 's really interesting . 
washington ? 
oh yeah ? what was 'fascinating ' about it ? 
well , <number> thing 's for sure . you could certainly lighten up . 
back to heaven on earth . i need my damn passport back . i 'm going home . 
but what did he see that made him panic ? 
a loser ? 
why are you inventing problems ? you <number> are a couple of goddam clones . you look so right together , i want to double my fee . 
that 's marvelous ... . you must have worked day and night ... . do n't you ever sleep ? 
look , there are n't ... there are n't but ... 
that man , then , he was the first . the first you -- 
uh , i do n't have much of an appetite lately . 
what were you talking about ? 
okay . 
rachel -- 
you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything . 
a favor ? 
but they know . 
yeah ... i 'll write a song . ha , ha . i do n't know . <person> is funny ! 
yes you did . last night . to your friend crabtree . `` is he any good ? '' he said . and you said : `` not yet he is n't . '' i heard you myself . 
what am i gon na do -- i 'm locked up in a friggin ' cell ? ! 
<person> christmas to you , sir ... 
listen , lothar . you know that crack i made about your ... butt ? 
yes . 
you bit someone 's nose off ? 
yeah , we met . they 're good men . 
he had the club out on the old trail road -- 
that 's confidential . could you put the money on the dresser ? 
thanks , <person> . have a good time tonight . 
just shut up and listen . hold off the attack as long as you can . if i can discover the location i 'll call you -- 
no , i know that part -- 
can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man ? 
yeah ? 
because we 're completely mismatched . 
snap out of it ! 
<person> <person> <person> . 
listen , <person> , the reason i called , that party is today instead of sunday . about eight-thirty , like only a few hours from now . so you 'll have to get hold of buddy , whatever he might be doing ... 
<number> . 
cornelius , why do you insist on provoking him ? 
panther ... 
what can i say ? when the spirit moves me . 
where 's your joy if you can not sing ? 
well it 's the company motto : <number> you ai n't happy we 'll send you the extra minute . ' 
so how are you doing , dad ? 
i do n't know who they are , or what they are . but they 're gon na get me and i 'm scared , jake . i 'm so scared i ca n't do anything . i ca n't go to my sisters . i ca n't even go home . 
what ? 
so ? you even said they 're good . 
thanks so much for coming over . 
<person> did n't howl . 
who 's ted bundy ? 
so all by yourself , you 're going to destroy every government ; in the world . 
and the drugs ? 
so ? 
god ... you 're so beautiful ! i ca n't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me ... 
yes . 
you think these are tits do n't you ? 
i 'm really beat . i need some serious `` z 's '' -- 
you do n't trust me ? 
they do what i tell 'em . 
i wanted to fuck her , that 's all ! 
goddamnit . 
when are you going to learn ? 
well , it 's all quite ... i 've never heard ... it 's quite ... 
come in . 
<person> , when we build up our tax base a little , you can have every- thing you want ; right now , the town 's broke . 
look , sir . i 'm no expert on the subject , but i 've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have . like , say , both countries agreeing to a <number> dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors . you ca n't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it . and if i were going to try and hide a few , i would n't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob is n't going to run and blab for a <number> bucks . we 're as smart as they are , and if they cheat , or even hold back information , we 'd pull right out . 
fine . i 'm fine . 
<person> prince is asking you to prom . 
you do n't remember . 
<person> ? 
you 're beginning to sound like <person> <person> already . 
... man ! 
he did n't have a dinghy aboard . i 'm going down to take a look at his hull . 
yes . 
i know , but -- 
it 's always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i 'd better ... take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own . 
how 'd you know about that ? 
ever pick your feet in poughkeepsie ? 
you 're <person> <person> , right ? 
we do n't have a tractor beam . 
oooh . hardball . that sounds interesting . are you going to strike me ? you could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me ... i 've got my own ropes . 
how old are you ? 
yes . i have to agree . from all you 've found so far , his position 's as good as yours . 
you have a job ? 
it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples . 
you have to ask ? 
the whole world thinks you 're underground . 
he 's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century . 
shoot him . 
why , how industrious . and how did you open protected files , may i ask ? 
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being . 
i could see she likes you . 
daddy ! where have you been ? 
i was ? 
carlos , i mean <person> , started out in the family connection business : real estate in tijuana , fishing boats out of ensenada , hydroponic raspberries . he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in <number> things : entering society and using his fishing boats . 
she knows <person> <person> . 
no , i 'm not saying her . i 'm just saying , i do n't know . 
hmmmph . 
i 'm not the devil . 
few days ago . 
you ca n't go . call them back . 
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince . 
he 's not coming . i thought he was just ... 
i 've just come back from the hospital . your victim has died . 
i plan to grow on you . 
what is she doing ? okay , <number> % . 
someone help me ! i 'm still alive , only i 'm very badly burned . 
you must bow down to the almighty bunghole . heh heh , this is cool . bungholio-o-o-o-o-o ! 
if you 're looking for a shark , you do n't look on land . you go out and chum for him . 
just look around . there 's a lot of her spread about . if you do n't remember the face , you must have heard the name of norma desmond . 
get the backslash , the colon , keys kids do n't use but geeks do . what would <person> want in here , anyway ? 
it 's about time . 
i watched your simulation , <person> <person> . very impressive . you know , you 're the only one to ever go up against <person> <number> who is still alive . 
jessie , girl this is insane . weather stat called in wind gusts up to <number> knots for tonight . 
we must return it , if you want your daughter back . 
i know you did what you could . 
no . 
cheaper i guess , take us both down in <number> van . 
ooops . 
well , sure . 
yes , this was <person> 's ... the <person> 's medical library . 
you 're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it wo n't work -- 
i think <number> <number> . 
the conference is at camp khitomer , near the romulan border . i 'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency . 
yeah . 
perhaps there is some good in you after all , <person> <person> . 
they 'll hang him all the same . 
well , now you know ... the enemy is on the move . we have n't much time . 
sra-i'm-sick ! sra-i 'm sick ! 
<number> , <number> years . 
do you know who was brought in for questioning ? 
sylvie -- ? what are you doing here ? 
i 'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy . at a certain point you 're gon na do something , and then there 's no turning back ... 
well , i , i did n't say i was special , but it 's <number> thing , you know , and it 's another thing to actually communicate it to people . you know what i mean ? if a tree falls in a forest and no <number> hears it , does that make a sound ? 
so what 's the problem ? 
-- <person> , are you with her ? is she there ? 
helen -- the killer directly contacted you . his interest in you is < u > intense < /u > . i 'm worried about you . i do n't want to lose you . i know this stirs up every monster under the bed , but this is the only direct contact we have with him . the only chance we have to trap him . so , you can turn internet back on , or i do , and we put somebody here on a <number> hour shift and you can kick , scream and hyperventilate . 
<person> asked me why we raise <person> angus-herefords 'stead of pure herefords . 
yes it is . i 've seen it . 
will he live ? 
you know , general , there is a gate of janus in rome which is only closed in time of peace . sadly , it has remained open for <number> <number> years . 
are you wasted ? 
do n't be an idiot ! you 're in no fit state to go anywhere . 
the neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here . she 'd bring him sandwiches and hot dr. pepper . 
i would n't lie on a thing like that -- i could go to jail . 
yes walter . 
the building on the corner . that <number> ! he 's been on the roof a half hour now !

multiple reasons . 
uh , sure , <person> . anything you say . instead of saying , `` <number> corned beef sandwich , '' and then , `` another corned beef sandwich , '' i 'll say , `` <number> corned beef sandwiches . '' 
my pocketbook . 
oh , <person> again . 
you said the slave had a crucifix ...

what are you talking about ? ? ? 
your licence is revoked . permanently . 
all right , <person> 's boss ... 
the background is . 
be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person , then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need . 
... they run on water . 
ouch ! see - you 're always beating me.. ! 
no , we do n't mind . 
none of that 's true ? 
<person> does projects all over the world .

yes . i come from a very musical family . my mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor . 
unless she has nerve . 
cue the commercial ! 
i want you to know , when you left spectre it opened my eyes . there was a whole life out there that i was not living . so i travelled . i saw france , and africa , half of south america . every day a new adventure , that 's my motto . 
they can look forward to that . 
sorta literally gets ahead of himself . 
there 's no reason why this - this savage personal note - 
i 'm fed up with sweating for people who are n't there . i sweat to pay off my father 's debts ... and he 's in his grave ... i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony , and she 's living on the other side of the world somewhere . 
just phone calls , right ? they ring , you answer , they do n't say anything , just blank . kids getting kicks . burglars looking for an empty apartment . i mean there is nothing that proves -- 
needing . 
with all due respect , the enterprise is a disaster . there must be other ships in the quadrant . 
did our marriage ever mean anything to you ? 
oh , wait , can you hold on <number> sec ? 
ms. kramer . 
would you care to explain what you 're talking about ? 
yeah , whoops i came . 
it was in her favorite handbag -- and , <person> <person> , that can lead to only <number> conclusion . 
what a pretty tune . 
<person> was old enough ... 
why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ? 
maybe hallucination is the wrong word . it was more than that . as though they were showing me . 
the whale 's mouth ?

dil ! dil ! what the fuck are you doing here ? 
y'all could be more specific . 
<person> laszlo . 
why , may <number> ask ? 
well , perhaps ... with a bit more to drink , i might ... 
do you think <person> <person> would approve ? 
okay , tell you what , i 'll give you a head start . you take her to the station house . do n't let her out of your sight . she 's the only warm body we got left .

ready to go , go , go ? 
why is that childish ? your living with the guy ! i 'm just asking how it 's going . 
what happened to them ? 
mm-mm . i never knew him . he died before <person> and i met . this here 's ... <person> and <person> 's mother and father ... there 's little <person> and <person> ... 
so they said more than the address . 
calm down , <person> . <person> , here 's what we 're going to do , harold : there 's a pull off up ahead , we 're going to stop there . 
i have to tell you . it 's strange . 
it 's not human , kelvin . whatever it is , it 's not human , and i am threatened by that . evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened . and i want to win . i want humans to win . so i am killing it before it kills me . 
'cause we < u > guarantee < /u > every load . anywhere , for any reason , it comes up short , we make good . your operations will , from now on , run risk-free . 
no . why ? 
we 're ahead of schedule , that 's all . you 're finding out here what you would have found out in africa -- that you are a rabbit , born to be eaten alive . 
whose car ? 
so what ? you do n't love him , do you ? answer me . 
ca n't you say 'hello ' to a fellow ? 
i have n't seen you since the wedding , <person> , you look great . 
well , if he calls in , tell him to get in touch with l. b. jefferies right away . i might have quite a surprise for him .

and where do you lead , boy ? 
you saw west 's body .

i thought ... i was hoping we could play it straight with <number> another .

my clothes , your clothes . what does it matter ? 
paillarde of veal .

i think so .

sir , please ... if there 's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud ... 
yeah , me too . that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers . 
thanks , but we do n't recognize `` brunch '' as an actual meal . 
you know what they 're doin ' now , <person> . 
what was it ? 
no more you do n't ! what is this - you 're showing off for her ? they 're supposed to hear you in korea ? 
it 's a good thing my family loves you . 
oh , yeah , well , you know . i 'm a big fan . i 've read all your work . 
mind your own goddamn business ... she comes in a lot ? 
but if i 'd known ... maybe some other time ... i mean , looking like this . 
is there a rush ? 
my what ? ! 
that 's funny ! 
do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea ? 
i 'm talking about your people , not you . 
stay with this kid . he 's a loser . 
well , i would know . i 'm the executive sales manager . 
how do you think . 
be sure to let me know if <person> is over there . 
maybe - just 'maybe ' - when their ship does n't return - they 'll decide not to come here , after all . 
he 's gone , too . 
from god . 
listen , jo-jo . does this mean anything to you ? <person> <person> 's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ? 
not really . yes , the fisher wedding chairs ... 
why are we way out here , when the shark 's back there ? 
what are you doing ? 
i need a man who knows where i am . 
you did n't tell him your name , did ya ? 
it 's a soporific . 
i got kicked in the head , too . 
he all right ? 
i 'm gon na get a soda , you want <number> ? 
not at all ? 
we 're looking for a suspect . we 've reason to believe he 's still in the area . 
will we be in this war ? 
it 's not safe down there . the fire started down there . the whole thing could collapse . 
says her name 's <person> <person> <person> in the night sky ... but she 'll answer to look since it pleases ya ... 
you gon na do what i say , got it ? 
hi . i 'm here for the big show ? 
[ he 'll die of his wounds ; bleed to death before he can do anything . ] 
ah , good evening , my dear duroc . i 'm afraid i 've been out hunting and i have had a rather bad fall . 
i noticed your hair . i guess it made an impression on me , that 's why i was pretty sure i recognized you . 
but you think it 's something else . what ? <number> of ours ? 
i 'm leaving . i 'm getting out . 
take it , man ! you 're all right ! hold it in ! guard ! 
there 's nothing in there about <person> . 
no way ! 
how bad is the other thing ? the secret ? 
sort of , um ... 
who said anything about the catholic church ... 
yeah , i guess it is . my mother is a complete anglophile , anything british makes her drool like a baby . she probably heard the name in some movie . she 's a prisoner of public television now . 
oh coco thank you . thank you so much . 
oh no , we would n't be from the same bloodlines or anything . we 'd be like <number> total strangers who ... accidentally had relatives that got married . 
well , why not ? i 'm feeling magnanimous tonight . the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . i 'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector . 
what was that ? ! ! ! 
paramus ... wonder what those initials stand for ... ... probably <person> <person> <person> -- well , it sounds like a lovely place . 
... i will . 
yes . 
i got news for you , <person> got his ass out of there before you did . 
no my brother , you have to go buy your own . 
how 'd you get it ? 
he has imputed to me conduct unworthy a senator -- and i demand he be made to yield the floor -- ! 
oh , do n't worry about that . 
what is that ? 
nobody . you . i had to tell you , right ? 
so we 'll take him with us . at least <number> we get back to the hummer . 
no , sandro ... we should go . besides , we have n't been in touch with anybody . not even with <person> 's father . we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned ... let 's be fair , he must be feeling awfully lonely . 
and i do n't take a shower in the middle of the yard . 
i always check the batteries . 
i know we cousins and all , but do n't try an ' hook me up with the big little sisters . 
somewhere in this city . not here , not here . tell penelope i loved her -- in my clownish way . and <person> . tell him to be a healer , by all means . 
these are really cold , huh ? 
`` security '' is not strong enough . 
what ? 
that 's a thick change of heart . 
so tell me about this dance . was it fun ? 
lucy . there are big things going on in my house . my granddaughter <person> , the only daughter of my son <person> , has engaged herself to be married a second time . 
lieutenant , the boy seems pretty lucid to me and ... 
i wondered about them , for so many years . i wondered if i looked like them , acted like them . i wondered why they gave me up . 
i 'm supposed to call in . 
as much as <person> <person> does ? 
i 'm a dangerous man . you 're not gon na ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat . 
yes i am her brother , he 's the son 
never ! never ! i 'll never forget you . i wanted to marry you . do n't you understand ! i love you . i love you ! 
yeah , i suppose ... dad , who 's <person> <person> ? 
he passed away . 
why ? 
i know . it would be almost inconceivable . 
stop ! -- 
huh ? 
i understand . 
what happened ? 
i wish you would n't do this . it does n't make any sense . let 's go somewhere and have some coffee . 
we ca n't just go off and -- 
i looked for you back at the party , but you always seemed to be `` occupied '' . 
the season of evil begins with the birth of the new year . bring me the child that i might live again . 
please tell me , <person> , what exactly are you going to do ? i do n't have to tell you i 'm afraid . 
so what ? 
i should have mailed it to the marx brothers . 
oh , please . 
oh ! that black box in our cell ? 
i have received intelligence from , sources of my own that the zulu impis are moving north of here and threaten your left .

do n't you think i have any feelings ? what am i ? a bowl of fruit ? a tangerine that peels in a minute ? 
lena ? 
it 's not bad . 
aye ! that too . 
there 's no way to lock it . 
oh , who cares ? 
what happened down there ? 
we 're going to bring her in . hide her out for a coupla days . and we 're issuing a campus lock-in this evening . no one is allowed out after dark . 
how long you been waiting ? 
i 'm really serious . that cop , he keeps watching me .

have you seen him ? 
<person> gaskell is n't going to send <person> <person> to jail , <person> . i know that . 
now remember , <person> -- this is going to be our little secret . 
in what way ? 
you 're killing him . you 're killing him for nothing . stop it . 
i 'm considering taking a job as a `` goofy '' . 
smart ? she 'll be arrested ! 
i completely understand ... 
come on , kid , let 's see if there 's any food in the house . 
bandit i , do you copy ? 
what are you talking about ? you do n't even know me .

the place has already be combed . forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside . 
why , it 's just like air , is n't it ? when i grow up , i 'm gon na smoke like a chimney ! i 'll be eleven tomorrow , you know . 
i 'm so sorry peter . <person> , that sure puts my problems in perspective . 
any chance of getting me out on bail ? 
in a box under my seat . 
so , did you sleep good ? 
i thought that was you , up there . 
no , rachel ... 
i understand . 
there 's the agency issue . i think <person> may suspect something already . we 're not on the best footing with him as it is . 
if you ask me , she 's pretty aggressive . you understand what i 'm saying ? 
thank you . are you well today , <person> <person> ? 
find out how we can hurt him . by the end of the day , i want to own him . 
i wanted to help you . 
you coming , or are you waiting for <person> ? 
there 's been some trouble downtown . 
so what were they doing here ? 
yes i do . 
his dry cleaners . you want him ? 
is it possible . yes . but -- 
indo-china . got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning . the place is about to go up in smoke . 
not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him . 
yeah . 
when i do sleep , i sweat a lot . usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming . 
then take me with you . 
fuck . 
-- what ? 
what the hell ? why not ? where should we go ? 
what ? 
twice . 
freeze ! 
diz , you 're a swell playmate -- but -- . maybe if i saw you once with your hair combed , or something -- or -- no , no -- i do n't think even that would do it -- 
we 're gon na disassemble his spiffy old batmobile , then reassemble it as an h-bomb on wheels . <person> ? yesterday 's victor is tomorrow 's vapor . 
bring me another , ti-joseph . i have to keep the lady entertained . 
... <person> , why did n't you tell me you were bringing him home ? ! look at me , i 'm not ready for this . 
because <number> of us is going to kill the other before this ends . 
that day , had you followed me to the market ? 
you thought that ? 
do n't get yourself all worked up -- 
that 's not gon na fly . 
would it stop you if i did ? 
he really wants to play metal ? 
no , stay off the line ! you 'll break her loose ! 
i 'd fuck <person> . 
no , <person> , do n't . . . 
oh , he said rim job . it 's when someone licks your ass for- 
nothing , nothing ... look , i live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up . 
the bureau already has the best lab . plus you have bloom at the university of chicago ... 
why ? 
god , <person> ! i never thought i 'd see you again . how 've you been ? 
i was here <number> years . and i only hated <number> . 
by the way , that reminds me ... saturday night we 're taking <person> <person> out for chinese food . 
that 's exactly what i think . i want you to create something that people want to see . let 's be honest , the majority of the people in the country are deaf , dumb and blind and i 'm including <number> <number> african-americans . you know and i know `` niggers '' set the trend , set the styles . this is a golden opportunity now . these idiots have to be led to the water . 
calm down . just listen for a minute.. please . 
i sure turned into an interesting driveway . 
hmmm . do you miss me ? 
yes . there have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure . there was <person> <person> in france -- jack the ripper in london . it 's not uncommon . 
yah , all right ... 
did you hear that ? 
cronin 's okay for lunch ? 
i have an idea . but , i mean , i 'm just making this up ... 
make it <number> . 
they do n't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks , which is something i 'm not even going to ask about -- 
... like you ? 
i would have been laughed right out of xenia . 
weeds will grow , <person> . 
i told everyone seven-fifteen . did n't i ? seven-fifteen . 
someone you have to get back to ? 
you 're right ... <person> , you 're right . 
no , he 's more of a dinosaur . <person> 's not a dummy , though . he 's juggling alot of balls on this <number> . 
do you know what happened yesterday , <person> ? i was officially nominated for the commissioner 's post for the lapd . there was a dinner last night , <number> hundred lapd officers were there . 
it 's the truth . why wo n't you believe it ? 
that 'll be thirty-eight cents . 
what i 've heard so far , it 's all a lot of talk . i was n't so sure what to make of it at first , cause , like i said , the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix . 
no . 
... sue ... 
it 's not < i > exactly < /i > him . 
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering . 
sure , it 's only worth <number> <number> or so , do n't bother telling me what you 're going to do with it . 
yeah , there 's an olympic size swimming pool up on the roof . take the stairs over there . 
please . it wo n't happen again . 
when i 'm sober . they get a little mixed up when i 'm drunk . most of the time they 're mixed up . 
you know what ? i do n't think i care for your rationale . 
not today , <person> . time to go back . 
well , you know , all i can say is , you 're a fucking fool . 
i sell them at the recycling center . gives me a little for gas and food . 
you 're lucky he did n't cut your *nipples* off , man . 
too bad he 's in kansas this summer . 
you do n't , do you ? 
i 'm okay . 
where 's <person> ? 
uh-huh i 'm sure . i 've killed someone ! oh my god i 've actually killed someone ! 
yes . i think so , too . 
did you have a good week <person> . are they treating you all right ? 
this is my crew and my fucking boat , and i 'm the responsible party . 
i guess we 'll call you two-ply . 
the game 's over . you lost . 
what are you asking me ? 
happy . he said `` happy ? '' 
i ca n't believe we did this . do i have to remind you that your wedding is in <number> days ? 
but this is impossible . 
really ? 
that a.i . of your 's got the whole matrix hummin ' . sticks out like a spider in a web . 
do n't hang up ! 
psychologist , therapist , whatever . 
no , it 's been too long . best to leave things alone . 
did you tell me <person> took the kids back to chicago for a few days ? 
your brother was a client with our london branch . we do a sort of informal scoring . his numbers were outstanding . sure you 're not hungry at all ... ? <person> <person> , best in chinatown ... 
what about ? 
mostly . it must be my face . my mother always said i looked like a priest . 
deal . 
that 's the whole thing . you know if you look at it . i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that . and everyone 's dying . and you better wear a condom or else . but the truth is . i do n't know any kids with aids . no one i know has ever died from that shit . it 's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes . 
beavis , huh huh , what'er you doing ? 
damn you , long ! my people are out there ! your people are out there ! 
everybody hates me ! 
you have all sinned ! 
the red sox were my world . i surrendered my existence to a team that could n't win the big <number> . 
what 'd you do ? wire <number> of your friends for money ? 
because there 's no way a girl could have killed them . 
captain , are you all right ? 
i am your king ! 
my mom . would be the problem . 
i 'm not fifteen . 
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power ? 
should n't be bad . <person> even help . but my guess is we 're going to have to paddle our way back . 
but they 'll be back . 
she 's got great tits . 
you all right ? 
huh ? 
who found him ? 
fuck that shit . 
the cards are now my only livelihood . sometimes i am in luck , and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see . it 's property , look you , and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me . when the luck goes against me , why , my dear , my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste . do you understand the cards ? 
and i believe that 's precisely where i read it , too . you see , j.j. , where i get my reputation for being the best-informed man in washington . 
no , really -- i 'm crazy about you . 
you heard him . 
mom , just this once , give it a rest . 
burke take a look at this damn thing it just does n't make sense . 
what about <person> <person> ? she was there too . 
i had gotten their trust . we were sharing fantasies . i could n't risk it . 
it 's not like he has n't made us wait a few times . 
why not ? 
-- a spy , you mean ? 
her room -- oh -- i see , <person> <person> -- i understand , <person> <person> <person> preysing . 
i do n't think that 's funny .

well . i 've found out some things . nothing really for certain . there are some strange people involved . 
yes , <person> , i was . 
<number> years . <person> , i 'm surprised he did n't ask you to marry him . 
i thought you 'd like this . best thing i ever did . if you do n't want to do it , do n't ... 
sir ... have you a name ? 
y'ai n't never had to wash another man 's blood off , dig it out y'fingernails ... y'had us for that . y'ai n't ever made a real beef on y'own , shit as light in the ass as you are , i 'll bet you ai n't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life . so if you think i'mma let your lil ' punk-ass , with the dirt i 've done for you , in the eleventh hour , sell me off like some fucking field nigger , hand me up to the feds like y'last chip , then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking mind !

somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on . 
she was in here when it went down . 
shove it ... . 
oh . that . 
and he is living proof . 
fine . the first thing to do is -- present <person> <person> to the press -- in the *right* way . <person> him along , <person> . 
<person> , get out ! 
there was a man , poet -- a theatre poet , i heard -- does he come to the house ? 
then i 'd think there must be a reason . 
let 's consummate our fiendish union ! 
stop . just wait . who 's the victim ? 
they turn out marvelous material in manchester . 
oh yeah . what about those other people ? anything ? 
oh , um , like famous quotes . i find reading them inspirational to me . and in my reading i 've come across some i thought you might like , too .

i made the polar bear pants .

she said i was so much like you . i said , no , i 'm not . i 'm like i am because of you , but i 'm not you , not as good as you . everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder . but you saw the better part of me , the part of me that could be like you , and changed me . you made me who i am . 
you actually listen to all those tapes ? 
how 's it going ? okay ? 
yeah , i figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels .

you 're absolutely right . yes , you 're right . hiring <person> was a mistake , that 's obvious . we 're over- dependent on automation , i can see that now . but that 's all correctable for the next time around . 
you do n't have to understand .

<number> of these days , you 're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you 've cut your throat . 
the prom . that 's funny .

so anyway , that 's the nightmare i 've been having lately . 
he was in love with you grace . he would 've done what you wanted , you could 've made a deal and ... 
visions of utopia in nineteenth-century american fiction . 
i do n't like ... uh ... polish love stories ... ... i like musicals . 
kristen , do n't start with me . you know what your shrink said ... 
i got them all , <person> . 
i hate that little fuck ! i hate him ! i hate him ! i should 've done him ! 
what do you want ?

<person> lipnik , i – 
you think i put that bullet in the mailbox myself ... ? 
i guess i thought i was protecting you . 
it 's an american boy 's rupture you 're supposed to close .

i ca n't kill this kid 's father ... 
they do n't really attack underwater and -- 
<person> kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath ? 
<person> , you 're now writing a book about the viznick case . you seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers . i have to ask , how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day , face to face with alleged killers ? 
in a railroad accident many years ago . 
call me irish , but i do n't believe in cooler heads prevailing . 
you 're as bad as <person> ... 
jack , stay away from me ! 
oh , yeah . you 'd be surprised what goes on around here . i 'd like to check the dressing room if i could .

i 'm lucky they do n't knock down the building . it could happen anytime . and everything worth remembering is right here . 
ok. ok. let 's not fence around ... this is the situation . some idiot somewhere in the building , some insect , confused <number> of our clients , b58/732 and t47/215 . 
well look at that . 
you look great . 
i have no gifts to bring , pa-rumpum- pum-pum 
you were wandering around . 
i do n't know . he sent back a statue that 's supposed to be an exact representation . but i 've never seen it . it 's in the exhibit . 
that ai n't me . 
now , you 're too suspicious . 
oh , do n't be silly ! no ! do n't be ridiculous .

who the fuck knows ? the <number> aces . he goes there . 
yes ? 
well , i guess we 're not , since we do n't have dates . 
the characters you meet . something happens to men in elevators . must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head , or something -- boy , i could tell you stories -- 
well someone 's gon na find them . 
i 'll keep it in my office room . 
it 's saturday . 
nothing . i was just sitting down for the first time tonight . 
hah ! it 's all make-up , <person> ... i asked nurse teresa to fix me up , i did n't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk . 
oh , that 's all . 
it is ? 
what 's he got ? 
you tell me . i remember a lot of things . i remember a garden , plunging down to the sea - the devil 's chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom , right on the shore , nothing between you and france . 
is it dark ? 
where you goin ' ? 
who 's your daddy ! 
i already did . no answer at the door and the apartment manager 's out . i 'm keeping them there . 
i know . 
you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings . is it so much to believe that <person> has brought you here ? 
why did you take <person> ? 
we ... we went to school together . <person> . 
where is this going , <person> ? 
turn around ! 
he knows everything . 
i think the worst is over . 
the probability on one-four-reel machine is a <number> and a half to <number> . on <number> machines in a row , it 's in the billions . it can not happen ... would not happen , you fuckin ' momo ! what 's the matter with you ! did n't you see you were bein ' set up on the second win ? 
you manage to throw me off balance . i adore you . 
i see . 
coming ? 
he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against congress . <person> , the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america . <person> to me , the whole army would rise up as <number> and place you on a throne ! <person> , you must declare yourself with us or against us . 
you did ? wow , sorry about that . <person> , <person> 's a little not so bright . he seems to think that you said -- 
farewell , my cuz . 
so he comes to l.a ... 
yes . 
that 's not the point , cookie . the point is what do you do with him ? you tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else , like <person> <person> or <person> . or you kill him off and the krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks . every <number> of us . so what do you do ? 
do you believe me ? 
if you 're making fun of me , i do n't like it . 
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press ! 
for what ? 
and if they 're still in place ? 
get me <person> <person> <person> . 
what about luther ? 
who ? 
if this war ended tomorrow , <person> is where the party would be . 
we do n't . 
we had a leak in the bathroom . he fixed it . 
we 're on the verge of closing a large navy contract . <person> is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares . we would give you a promissory note ... 
<number> years , maybe , for a trial . double that for the appeal . 
is something wrong ? 
as a child i hated being told how sweet i looked . that angelic little face was n't me at all . i had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image . sometimes words were enough -- but i was n't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously . i enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who i was . that same look you gave me when i turned the gun on you . 
look , <person> , i 'm facing it . 
she gave you the old brusheroo , kiddo ... believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate ... 
braces . 
well , i was thinkin ' , maybe ... you know somebody at the bank ... could help me get my jewelry out ? there 's a lot of money in there . lot of money in there , and i 'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out . 
and why the hell would you give me money ? 
there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible . 
during the road test ... 
why <person> ? 
oh my god ! 
actually , no , i 've changed my mind . i should n't have called . 
hmmm ... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album . you 're not trying to soften me up , are you ? 
almost <number> years . 
are you listening to me ? you 're involved in this ! i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight ? 
or even a good porno . 
captain says to wait 'til the patrol gits here . 
yeah ! 
does she , goddamnit ? ? 
sure i am . she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens . if you wo n't agree to that , she 'll apply for a divorce regardless of the president 's wishes . i ca n't tell her she 's wrong , because she is n't wrong - 
she was angry at herself . 
your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker . 
this is a great house , really . everything . <person> , <person> , <number> tennis courts . you know who the original owners were ? <person> <person> , then <person> <person> . then you know who lived here ? 
do you have many patients , doctor ? 
so , do you enjoy being an actor ? 
yeah . 
that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . <person> asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you were n't a farmer ; get <person> to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell <person> to do it . <person> , you ought to grow up . 
you really think you 'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ? how fuckin ' stupid are you ? 
okay -- now you listen to me ... you 're gon na come to this meeting and you 're gon na put on this make up , and you 're gon na come home at <number> o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table . 
... yoha , <person> ... yoha . < i > why < /i > <person> ? 
i thought you 'd be thrilled . you 're being taken seriously . 
no problem . 
get lost ! 
yeah ... <person> <person> ... 
i did . he wants it on exhibit . 
about a half a mile i think it is . 
this is uncomfortable for me -- because , well , i do n't mean it as a knock , but we approach this differently . 
mm . 
... brom bones ... 
i guess i 'll rob a bank . 
<person> , you do n't know how it was for me back in high school . no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway . you never dreamed about being popular- you already were . all i wanted was to be accepted , and they just fucking tortured me . i ca n't do all that again . i ca n't go back to <person> <person> . 
this is empty , just coming ! 
no , she did n't . 
could you bring it up ? 
and what do you do , sir ? 
what are you going to do ?

you know how easy it would be ? he wo n't be anywhere near that mall . pull <number> more switch , up front . that 's it . half-a-million dollars . need help ? 
i still do n't get when you gave her back the pillowcase . 
how are we gon na get him out of there ? 
why do you keep calling me , <person> ? what do you want from me ? 
do you always have to repeat ? 
were you on hop ? you were passed out when you got arrested . were you hopped up , <person> ? 
luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on <person> <person> last month , including photos of the victims .

where 's luc and <person> ? 
<person> cured , yeah , that was read out to us . the inspector read all that out to us . he said it was a very good way . 
what have you set your mind to ? 
you ... you are out of order , mr lombard . i ... 
does it matter ? 
thank you . 
you talk kind of funny , but i like it . 
just what you see . a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution . 
if i were you - 
what 's your location ? i repeat , what 's your location ? 
they wanted to call it <person> <person> . but somebody said that name was taken . 
you think it 's july of <number> ? that 's the future , <person> . do you think you 're living in the future ? 
there goes another scrub lady . 
<person> <person> went to get you some smelling salts . he was quite surprised that you fainted . 
why do n't you just shoot him now ? here , i 'll get a gun . we 'll just shoot him . <person> ! dead . <person> . 
who the hell are you anyway ? what is this place ? 
eddie ... 
sure you do n't want to come with me ? 
hey , uh , mister ? hey , okay if i grab a cue ? 
what right ? do you want me to tell you ? 
she said awfully sorry , make yourself comfortable , she wo n't be long . .

i left my pomade in that car ! maybe i can creep up ! 
emil the amazing . the bastard fired me and hired another girl , a redhead . i 'm working on a new business card , pass out to the cafes . how 's this sound -- 
right . the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do . they get a good idea , shop it around , raise some capital , then sell it off to a bigger company . <person> , intel , oracle , whatever . the beauty of it is , they 've pretty much sold the company before they 're even real . the bigger company is already set to buy it , all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works . so they get some start up capital , make it work , then sell it for like <number> times the initial loan . 
no . the girl . 
jersey ? you know what the traffic 's gon na be like ? 
your office is the workmen 's -- 
okay . come on , big guy !

we had a report of gunfire , so if you could -- 
do you even know who <person> <person> is ? 
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted . 
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and i got my second demo into production , is i 'm a lot smarter than you . i never give my best stuff away . 
this is n't '48 , <person> . they 'll never buy it . 
-- or lack thereof ? 
i 'll never forgive you . 
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men .

i married him when i was <number> . he was a cellist , and i thought he was the most brilliant man i 'd ever met ... and i 'm sure he was , because at that age , i had n't met that many ... but he was insidious , you know . he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity , musically , as a woman , as an intellect . but in this completely imperceptible , pleasant way , so that you were n't even sure he was doing it . <person> , i just woke up <number> morning and i said , you know something <person> , you 're full of beans , and i left him ... 
uh uh ! what did we talk about ? 
well , the studio told me not to .

night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it 's when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you 're afraid of . 
do n't you see what 's happening ? you 're changing . you 've got powers you 've only just begun to tap . <person> , mental prowess you 've never dreamed of . god , this hurts . i 've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working . i 'm sorry i have to take so many shortcuts in the training process .

aw , they 've gone crazy . you ca n't reason with a mob . 
i , i ... i ... 
maybe you do n't appreciate the gravity of this situation . it 's bad enough that we do n't have what we came here for . it 's worse that we do n't know where it is . and now this . this was supposed to be my last job . i already put the deposit down on my boat . how can you eat at a time like this ? i get nauseous just watching you ... 
are you going to ride that wave ? 
can i ask you a question ? why did you come here today ? if you found this deed , why did n't you just ask <person> ? 
his wife 's ?

<person> mccord . 
what list ? 
it might show . 
my god , what have you done to him ! 
mom , i want to go to the fair ... 
lieutenant ? 
but why now ? 
sir ... 
it 's more like your attitude . your tone , your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves , in your opinions , your indifference to conventional views . 
they belong to the people . 
-- it 's your ifb , somebody else has got an earpiece , you 're picking up their signal -- 
is it over ? 
every <number> of those times i was being supportive . something you wo n't understand . 
you were a roadie for <person> <person> ? 
ca n't this thing go any faster ? 
pay no attention to this swine . he ca n't handle the medicine . 
i brought you a special present . 
i did n't have to pee then . 
then you did n't know <person> later on . 
i 'm sorry . i ca n't do it . 
the americans , and the un they have you as a war criminal . you are on a list . 
oh . <person> there , mrs. dreyfuss . 
there 's nothing wrong with ... that . 
the truth is , the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public . <person> <person> loves her and <person> <person> is her best defense . 
you mean because what's-his-name . 
i should kill you ... if it 's true you should die ... i should kill you now ! 
what ... 
can i ask you a favour , <person> ? 
thel , listen to me . if , on the <number> to <number> shot that i should -- that anything should happen to me . would you take care of <person> ? 
we lost a kid about a month ago to fairview . i do n't know where he got the razor ... but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake . 
are n't you going out with <person> ? i 'm sorry . it 's none of my business . i did n't mean ... 
do n't know . 
is n't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public ? 
let him out of here , lieutenant . 
he does n't even look like that . 
what ? 
we 're friends . 
i figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it , <person> . 
have they harmed you ? 
stay away from me ! stay away ! 
there 's got ta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown philadelphia . i take it there 's a reason we 're going to this one . 
can you believe it ? 
jack , could you stay up here for a while ? 
he has to . that 's predestination . if <person> is omniscient , if he knows everything -- and he would n't be god if he did n't -- then he must have known , even before the creation of the world , the names of those who would be saved . 
i ai n't your partner , i 'm your manager . i 'm managing to get your money out of mexico , into america , in your hands , and i 'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops . that makes me your manager , and managers get fifteen percent . 
... just wan na be a good mom , a nice person , a decent citizen . just wan na take good care of my kids . you know ? 
somebody <person> picked up on the train . i do n't even know her name . 
no . she was mindless but not like <person> <person> . but the houngan cured her . 
not the whole time , of course . i -- 
oh . well perhaps you could introduce us anyway . 
sir , i came from the chicago offices myself , and if i may say , sir , there are still some very good ... . 
keep the change . 
you mind if i ask a few questions about your husband ? <person> ? 
then you are wrong . 
video . 
you 're not my therapist . you 're hear to study me . face it —— i 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you . 
more than you think . 
in fact , we think you did such a good job , we 'd like to extend things a little bit . 
yeah , that 's right . 
the point is to not call attention to ourselves . 
huh ? 
what am i supposed to say to her ? 
i tried that already . 
just for laughs we raided wonder boy 's house . there was a gallon of <number> of the corpse 's blood in his carpet . i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year . 
plenty of circuits in a walkman ... 
i 'm going to hang up now , <person> . 
and my eyes ... my eyes are gray . look ! you see ! 
it is . 
what 's the matter ? 
that 's the ticket , laddie . 
take it or leave it . 
how romantic . 
<person> to wake you , sir , but <person> urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of enterprise . 
so i got talent . so what beat me ? 
i 'm sure she did . 
agnes , i do n't believe that . tell me . i 'll protect you from her . 
want me to get that ? 
huh ? huh huh . 
say again , sir ? 
you 've got <number> going , mrs. mulwray . 
damn ! 
a girl makes a guy cum , it 's standard . a guy makes a girl cum , it 's talent . 
if the drug is here , we must destroy it . 
and this is <person> <person> . 
how long have you been into wine ? 
he made that quite clear , yes . 
get out , both of you ! 
only god knows the answer to that . 
yes . exhilarating , is n't it ! 
jordan . you watch your ass . 
of course . look -- i 've got some missing persons , fatalities , evidence of a large predator ... . 
as a matter of fact , i do sing a little . 
well , that 's great . 
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot . 
'course he does . 
this is all witwer . he 's setting me up . 
scar 's band was headin ' north ... to winter in at fort wingate ... eatin ' agency beef . that 's what this buck said ... maybe he lied . 
you did n't say what it was for , did you ? 
general <person> <person> , then . 
knox , you are so infuriating ! 
so how do we do this ? 
<person> foreal . 
you think this is funny ? 
now , now . 
frank , i think maybe you lied to me . 
tell him i do n't want to see him . tell him he 's not welcome here . 
where were we ? 
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man . 
what 's up guys ? 
i know it 's not the greatest . it 's commercial . 
look , i told you inside -- 
can you make out any pattern in all that ? 
what the fuck is wrong with you brian ! ? if you 'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes ... you 'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer . he is ... for real ! 
do you believe in them ? 
what 's your name , boy ? 
not a gift . a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex , that 's all . a genetic fluke . 
pinta , we 've got to go . travel sucks at this time . 
the only way he 'll go with <person> is if you 're in too . 
look , i know it 's been frightening , i know your dreams have seemed real . but ... it 's okay . <person> ? 
<person> grimm is a genuine american hero who 's been through a terrible orde -- 
i ... i ca n't do this . 
yes . 
<person> about that , <person> , but tailgating is <number> thing i ca n't tolerate . 
and how many ghosts have you caught , <person> <person> ? 
very amateurish , <person> . i 'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic . i 'm not an idiot ! do n't treat me as <number> ! i 'll call you everyday ... you get <number> minute , whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you ! are you ready to play ? 
you think you 're so ... but you 're just ... 
what are they doing now ? 
vf <number> , the oriskany . you remind me of him . you 're just like he was , only better ... and worse . 
i said , are you deaf as well as stupid ? 
why do n't we go take a swim ? 
it 's not what you think . <person> , maybe it is ... . 
you scurvy shyster bastard ! watch your language ! you 're talking to a doctor of journalism ! 
just a minute . no , you do n't . 
together we stand ! 
you thought wrong . i haven ’ t seen <person> for months .

i 'm going out for a few hours . 
i missed my therapy . i overslept . 
to protect his people . 
you do n't reckon i 'd leave you . 
it was n't my day . 
i 'm looking at a picture of you and <person> taken < u > yesterday < /u > . 
yes . the famous <person> <person> . i 've heard all about you , sir . you were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off , on your own , like some half-assed cia cowboy - endangering the gold , attracting that lunatic woman , and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide . 
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep . 
i -- lost something . 
<person> 's going as a condom . 
over my dead body . 
y-y-yes , a b-b-bus ! 
meaning the duck himself , i guess . 
your research laboratory is most impressive ...

<person> funboy . 
a better friend . 
merlin , will i live ... ? ... i was dreaming ... 
leave the zone ? what would i do on <person> ? 
i do n't know , i 've just been thinking , maybe we 're not happy with each other . 
i leave it to you , mr . <person> . can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle ? 
i 'm only allowed `` g '' movies . 
scully -- listen to me . i 'm going home , then i 'm booking a flight to dallas . i 'm getting you a ticket , too .

well i 'm done talking to you , what do i have to do , draw you a diagram ! 
he keeps asking me questions about you . do you know him ? do you recognize him ?

carnivores hunt near stream beds . do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar ?

no , sir ! 
we ca n't jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane ...

tell him you love him . with all your heart . 
no ... tell me . 
you think ? 
of course you should n't . you do n't know how to do it . dunking 's an art . do n't let it soak so long . a dip and plop , into your mouth . if you let it soak so long , it 'll get soft and fall off . it 's all a matter of timing . i ought to write a book about it . 
do you need a hug or something ? 'cause i would have no hang-ups about hugging you ... you know , you being a guy and all . just do n't knead my ass when you do it . 
i got it myself ... i could n't wait . 
yes . 
so will you ? 
elegant words , sir , when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip . in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock . i learned at the knee of the master . 
you keep that -- that 's for you . i want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come . 
... somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun . 
<person> trumbo ? we never met . but i 'd like to think i know him . 
you 're talking through your hat . you 're offering a deal because you 've got no proof . 
they 're makin ' a movie , here , goddamn it .

but maybe you 'd better not . i 've got a witch mad at me , and you might get into trouble .

hi . 
thirty -- sometimes fifty .

<person> --

stop trying to play big brother . i 'm a grown woman . you got ta lotta nerve . <person> , you can hardly pay your rent and you 're gon na tell me what to do . come off it . 
if you 'd lost confidence in me , why did you give me the kronos suit ? 
but then when she got into it . she really got into it . it was good . 
why did you say that ? 
well her mother did n't buy them for her . 
i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl - 
you know that 's not true . 
i 've been contradicted all my life ... eternity ! 
what 's that ? 
i 'll be there . 
time ? 
okay , baby . now you outfitted . you ready to tackle the street ? 
this is great . i 'll be able to watch your act every night . 
well ... they have to service the plane ... and get a pilot down to the field , unless there 's <number> hanging around there still ... and then they have to get the immigration officer ... 
this wo n't do . 
i said i would n't . 
we must try to get horses . 
this is the best score yet . 
<person> < u > ceased < /u > . i do n't know where it came from . 
do you swear you did n't know ? 
what do i *mean* , huh ? uh -- *i'll* tell ya -- <person> 's series -- a pass ! in a month it 's worth fifteen bucks ! 
look it 's very simple . you tell me everything that has n't been invented yet , and i 'll invent it . we 'll be partners . fifty—fifty . 
look , i do n't have time for you , get out of my way ! ! 
you break up with me because i wo n't fuck you . 
how old is he ? 
mr . powers , my job is to acclimate you to the nineties . you know , a lot 's changed since <number> . 
i 'm calling an attorney . 
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth ? 
so this ... foam you found in the lungs . how does it get there ? 
want me to imitate a stupid cop ? 
he 's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department , so <person> <person> introduces us ... 
you look wonderful . 
in a small way . 
bowling died for me years ago . besides , i 'm a living dead legend . i 'm a hero . 
he said he thought we 'd make a pretty good team . 
it may be <person> , but it is n't suicide . 
thirty . name your price . everyone has a price , what 's yours ? 
yeah ? 
what ? no . i 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms . 
in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt . 
this is your place . 
no , you look like a hooker . 
yeah , buddy ? 
it 'll work ... . 
if you 'd a told me <number> years ago i 'd see children walkin ' the streets of our texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses i just flat out would n't of believed you . 
<person> shit ... 
only <number> did the shooting . so what are you thinking , russian retaliation ? 
everything . because after tonight , you will belong to me . 
am i like such a fellow ? 
well , why do n't you take it out of your account ? there 's a lot there . 
yes . yes . i think so . i hope you 'll be comfortable . i 'm putting you up at my ... 
sure dear , yes . 
do n't you talk to me like that , you little foul mouth degenerate ! really , sir , i thought that you at least ... 
what kind of show is this gon na be ? 
so , i do n't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this ? 
<person> about that . that 's an inch of the stuff , imagine what the whole thing 'd do . 
she left you , <person> . she 's not your responsibility . she takes very good care of herself . if she wants to romance the kid , it ai n't your business . your business is to snap out of it . 
oh yeah . i liked it so much i 'm cutting you out of the squadron . 
do you want me to get someone ? 
what does it say ? 
yes . you could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets . 
just like going swimming , is n't it ? 
no . kissing and hugging , okay , but if it 's actual sex they have to cut away . 
your <person> <person> dispenser ! 
i will . when can i come visit ? 
what 's this ? 
... and what is that , <person> ? what ? bad luck . that 's all it is . i pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks . that 's what it does , that 's all it 's doing . <person> . i pray it misses you . that 's all i want to say . 
grass . i grow some pot down there . it 's no big deal , just something i dabble in . the truck 's for a quick get away , deliveries , whatever . 
that 's me . 
maybe gay is n't the right word . but , anyway , it 's been rough with him ... whatever the fuck he is . <person> . my significant other ... heh heh . and i guess on a certain level , i want to break it off , but i feel ... y'know ... it 's like this constant questioning and re questioning . do i end it ? should i give it more time ? i 'm not happy , but what do i expect ? relationships require work . you know the drill . the thing that i keep coming back to is , i 'm not getting any younger , i want to have a baby ... at some point ... maybe ... right ? so then i think i should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- i mean , he 's a good guy . it 's not really settling . then i think maybe i 'm just a victim of movies , y'know ? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be . but then i think , no , this is what i really want , so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it . you know ? agreed ? but then i think he is a good guy and ... it 's complicated . y'know ? 
this is the nexus ? 
you should 've done what i did . a clean break . 
yes , no , yes . i ca n't . i ca n't afford that . i 'm sorry . <person> . 
mean you to seek him out below ? 
it 's the boy next door throwing at his birds . i 'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window 
there 's to be a bright side , look for it . 
stick-up . needed dough to get ashore . 
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom . 
hit me ! 
i just want you there in case there 's trouble . 
look , our situation in a nutshell is , no prison wants 'em , no prison will take 'em . i 'm even talkin ' hellholes , where the warden 's as hard as a bar of iron . no one wants those fuckin ' assholes behind their walls , dealin ' with 'em day in , day out . 
and now that <person> 's coming back , and because he 'll certainly *need* you ... 
where are you going ? 
uh ... sure , <person> ... what ? 
what ? ! ? 
he did n't do it -- nick ! 
it makes you nervous ? 
they 're all asking how you 're doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ? 
i 'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences . 
look at her face . a real bitch . 
i 've no choice 
these guys that got me down here , you know , huh ... they think that i 'm part of this whole thing . they think i 'm part of the plot to rob the bank ! 
what ? 
i made my bones on the street , you know . i did riglioni in his own house . i was made in the family , okay . 
why not ? after all , i got stuck with a railway ticket . i think i 'm entitled to know . 
no -- not at all . 
i 've got <number> condition . 
the faster you find the bags , the bigger you boys ' finder 's fee will be . 
mom , i mean dad ? 
he just < u > appeared < /u > . you have no idea how he arrived in this lake ? 
so what do you think ? 
he touched your wallet ! where 's your wallet ? 
well i was uh , just looking ... 
yes , you should go . 
do n't look like nothing . 
well , then , you know <person> <person> is n't going to jeopardize a setup like that for <number> rubber-lipped— 
i 'm home from school . my father 's in the hospital . 
i 'm a catholic , you know , and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin . 
only a pig could do a thing like that . 
you 're coming back ? 
you do n't know who the fuck -- 
in every practical sense , yes , but , officially , of course , i would have to retain command . 
that there is n't <number> , as of today . i had my period . i could n't believe it . he still wanted to marry me . 
but you will always be here ? 
these rings represent the commitment <person> and liz make to each other on the day . fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ? 
you ok about that ? 
i did . 
you think ? 
no , you look good . i was just wondering . 
so you 're doing all right then , <person> . you 're making good . 
oh no , <person> , that 's not obvious enough . not at all . <person> , did you hear that ? 
really ? 
who knows ? 
shut up ! they got wind of something they do n't like ! 
are you familiar with `` heaven ? '' 
i 'm not crazy . i know the difference between right and wrong . 
he 's right about <number> thing . we do have to survive . 
what the fuck is that supposed to mean ? what the fuck 're we gon na tell <person> ? 
oh . well , i live -- 
i hope he does n't have rabies . 
okay , okay , <number> -- 
no . 
i like that . 
aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh ? 
later . but first -- him . 
why the hell did he do that ? what the hell did i do ? 
<person> said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house . <person> 's an ex-cop , thinks he can help . 
how are you ? 
we really should get together sometime soon ... i-i 'll definitely call you this week -- 
look , <person> , the truth is ... i 'll be in town for a while now but i do n't think we should see each other for a few weeks . 
is there anything wrong ? 
the red sox 
you 're a beautiful woman . 
i 'm sorry - i do n't seem able to understand anything you say . he 's alive now this minute - he 's doing something . 
when ? 
here . 
i 'm looking for <person> <person> . 
has it changed since the last time you were here ? 
i 'm glad you got your memory back , <person> ... because you 're going to need it ... where are the stones ? 
then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in hollywood history . 
i do n't know . waiting , i guess . you know ? 
<person> went to help his brother . i understand that and i ca n't help it if you do n't . 
says he is the man 's doctor ... you know ... 
you know something ? those guys are really starting to piss me off ! 
<number> days . are you hungry ? 
you have run out of time . the amount now is <number> <number> <number> . i will call later with instructions . you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter . 
<person> was under our nose the whole time . 
yes . 
oh , you infant ! how much did you lose ? 
they grab <person> and she walks in . well , that 's the way it goes . <number> in , <number> out . <person> ? 
it was bad . 
what ? 
he 's clever . he had help . 
why ? 
we used to be in the supply section , carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them . 
what ? 
nothing was real . 
jesus , you sound like my ex-wife . 
uh , look , <person> ... 
but you do n't know where he is . 
your insight is enlightening . 
hundred and <number> ai n't a hundred and thirteen . 
yeah , well you 're really gon na have some bad dreams if we find out you did n't . 
meet me later . <person> . <person> pie . <person> splits . and no mom ! 
i think everything 's okay here . 
who is that guy ? 
no , <person> , you do n't understand . this is fate , this is destiny . there 's no avoiding it . 
so soon ? without any of those answers you so longed for ? 
that 's what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it 's cool . want to take me for a ride ? <person> 's kind of lonely this time of day . 
will you get a hold on yourself . 
does n't cbs have confidentiality agreements , <person> <person> ? 
do n't be a fool , <person> , we got ta r- u-n-o-f-f-t , but pronto ! 
so i do n't shop . 
follow me . 
okay , let 's do it . 
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time . 
yes ... could you please give this to enzo . 
whatever . 
look . i 'm happy to entertain you , as always , but i have a question for you . are we really `` friends ? '' 
and that 's why you 're losing your bet ? 
what are you doing ? 
what is it ? 
i just saw <person> . he 's here . 
no , they 're not from wendy . 
a <number> . <person> . 
but really , m'sieu , this is n't necessary . 
there 's a question . whether they stopped bein ' . and when . 
i 'm a libra too . that 's why we get along so well . 
listen , kid . you 're in a tough spot , and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff -- 
i have . <person> down over there . 
we encoded <number> minutes -- 
yeah . i knew you 'd catch on eventually . 
you had her < u > lie < /u > about that ... that fancy-boy < u > model < /u > ! 
can you feel that ? 
all right , what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need nornel <number> plus <person> 's . 
the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ... 
well , we can hope , ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask , a cellular phone -- not much there . 
last july i dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident . they asked me what number means `` good luck '' in jewish . 
up his house . i do n't know what 's going on but i know it 's got ta have something to do with this kid . 
oh -- no . i 'm just sort of disturbed about things . 
we always help our friends , do n't we ? it is no secret that the government has lost a lot of popularity because of you , my boy . there are some that think that at the next election we shall be out . the press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do . 
we 've no proof , of course , but we rather think so , yes . 
it 's not really anyone per se , it 's more of separate groupings . 
what , for example ? 
... to talk , son . 
thank you ... 
who ? 
good thinking . 
the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they 're interested in putting <person> <person> out of business . 
it must end here ... or i am the future . 
good morning , sir . how can i help you ? 
<person> <person> ! <person> <person> ! 
victory is mine . i thank thee o lord that in thy ... 
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport . 
uh ... 
it 's this darned corset . it binds . he retrieves the stick . 
i want to know ! 
i wo n't . now just relax . where are you ? yeah , i know it ... on pico . are you alright ? 
nothing . 
yeah . 
what d'you mean ? 
yeah ? what have you got to do ? look at you . look at your face . all the things you must be thinking . man , you must really hate my guts . well , you know what ? it 's okay . 
an old woman and her grandson . 
< u > why not , <person> < /u > ? 
hey , <person> ... 
what a honeymoon . 
you want cash ? 
no , no . that 's just not the way things are done . besides , how 's he know i do n't just get in there see there 's too many and just serve em their fuckin ' food and beat it ? 
can we change the subject ? 
you tell theo he 's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job . 
the moon sinks lower into the hills ! we must hurry to the finish . 
their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum . 
<person> ? 
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime . 
right ! that 's what we 're shooting for . <person> <person> and have been in contact with the state department , but right now relations with the turks are n't too good , <person> 's upset the hell out of them . our best bet 's ... right here . 
i don't- . 
do n't be such a baby ! 
boys , old lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew . you help me place it on <number> of your missiles and i promise you . . . if <person> throws it into the sun , he 'll get the biggest surprise of his life . i 'll be able to introduce <person> to his first nightmare . . . a nuclear man ! 
but when it comes out , the public will be outraged . it will look like germany all over again . 
then i 'll tell you a story — a lovely story . do you know the story of rapunzel ? 
we 've got to get that valve turned off . their oxygen is almost gone ... 
yes ! yes ! oh , <person> ! yes , oh , yes ! but where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow ? ! 
of course you will look mean , <person> , you will look really scary . 
oh ! <person> , <person> -- was it -- i thought she said , <person> -- 
my stomach 's growling . 
... but she 's , no , <person> 's smarter than that . she would n't be here for a ... 
... we do n't have thirteen at table ... 
<number> years ? 
give me a shot from <person> 's ring . 
<person> ... what 's the matter ? <person> ... why are you upset ? 
do n't lie to me . 
the era when crime did n't pay -- 
chip is off to a fine start this year . focused ... conscientious ... participates actively in classroom discussion . 
the door ws unlocked . is it always unlocked ? 
that 's what turns me on about you , <person> . you 're so smart . 
okay . where to begin ? with your constant absenteeism ? with your unpresentable appearance ? you 're up for review ... 
may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor , this is me . so watch it ... <person> . 
oh yes , i 'm sure dr. <person> could . if we had the parts . 
right . so why is he dying ? he does n't appear to have any broken bones , no entry wounds of any kind -- what 's killing him ? 
our friends in little russia . go in and ask for a man named <person> . 
come here , come here . 
sure i do . 
you played for the sox ? 
what about your friends ? or your brothers ? when do i get to meet them ? 
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you . 
skip , you 're a visionary . that can be a burden . 
check it out . 
did n't i teach you to always arch your back ? 
i 've literally got to run ! 
yeah , like maybe never . 
yo , you think we killed that guy ? 
i know , but you pick on the <number> time in my life i like not to remember . i was in the bad lands . really not well . it 's something that happens to a lota cops . we do n't wan na talk about that . 
i ca n't think of any . 
i do n't exactly know what to say -- i 'm sorry . 
you could double the size of your hardware store ! you 'll be rich . 
yeah ? 
hello , <person> . long time no see . 
that song by <person> <person> , where it 's said `` like a pusher , party truth , partly fiction , a walking contradiction '' . 
hand me a towel . i 'm getting out . 
at your house . 
the front door slammed . <person> went out . there 's a different car starting . 
and when i clap my hands together twice , you will wake up . do you understand ? 
ha-ha ... yeah ... what about that road back there , though ? it says ‘ closed to the public ’ , doesn ’ t it ? 
mistake ? hey , guy , get back here ! 
they were slaughtering the spring lambs ? 
why do i think there 's never been a ripley rainy day ? 
your appearance does n't suggest that at all , mr . chance . 
b-but it 's our money -- 
i did n't mean to bite him , i really did n't . 
tape it off , we 'll want to fine-tooth- comb it . my guess is that the unsub is having us on . he checks in , pays , picks up the key , but never walks inside . tell me if i 'm wrong . 
-- yeah . 
<person> was so strong back then . working from the crack of dawn . so proud of his peaches . 
yes -- you are right , <person> . i can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- all the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground -- 
tell me . 
he 's all right . 
how do you like <person> <person> ? 
let 's go outside and talk . we need to do that . 
we were eating and puking together in harmony until <number> day , <person> walked me home from school . he was my first boyfriend . i was fourteen . 
why are you lying ? 
i 'm thinking about the kid . i 'm sure he 'd do a good job for you . 
no , i do n't get that ! 
i did n't think so . 
good ? of course . are you kidding ? i 'll tell you what . buy me lunch , my friend , and i 'll tell you the best christmas story you ever heard . <person> 's that ? and i guarantee every word of it is true . 
i 'm gon na call her . 
you okay ? 
of course . 
goodbye , my love . 
i 'll stick it in the evidence locker ... 
do n't panic , <person> . 
what am i scared of ? 
she 's blue as hell . no marks on her neck . asphyxiated ? not the same -- no ligature marks . outdoors ... 
gentlemen , i did n't call you here at such an hour to make accusations , i just want to explore the possibilities . now , i have <number> questions ; is the man a foreign agent ? or , have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient ? or , thirdly , have the man 's files been destroyed ? now , i 'd like some answers . 
you stupid bastard ! 
i swear it . by <person> and the holy -- 
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell . 
you ca n't come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine . 
i said let 's go . 
yeah –– yeah –– hurry up . <person> 's sick . 
no . i was the first <person> to leave <person> . it caused quite a stir , in fact . but i had spent my whole life ... 
where 'd you find them ? 
that 's no battle , kid ... they 're just sitting there ! 
on the contrary , i 've observed he 's not only a good technical surgeon , he 's a good military surgeon . and that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the united states army . 
but try too hard -- 
you did n't become crazy . 
cool down , franco . the guy 's sorry . 
take it easy , <person> ... it 's all right . now , try to think clearly ... do n't you mean _jason's_ hand ... do n't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed <person> <person> 's throat ? 
that 's why when i was little i never went to live with my mother . 
you know , <person> , you take shit once , you take shit forever . 
... little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party ... city council ... ? what 's the trouble ... ? 
travers , you 're not running things . 
i despise these kind of winds . <person> , i guess i 'm a little on edge . seems this catwoman has everyone , men and women , on edge . do n't you feel <person> says something about the duality of all men and women ... 
well ... .what do you want , then ? 
same as you said . what did you call her ? a `` man-eater '' , `` a devouring death goddess . '' 
big backyards , fences , some hedges , why ? 
pee ... per ... man . 
i do n't know what i saw . <person> ? <person> wants to call it a russian submersible , fine . it 's a russian submersible . no problem . 
<person> <person> . <number> street between <person> and <person> . the emergency number is 327-0800 . 
hey ! 
wake up ? ! 
you do ? 
dude in the dress is <person> <person> , used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself . <person> on the street was he was saving up for an operation . 
hell , good luck ! 
what ? what ? 
mommy ! 
it 's a fine thing to establish policies but , when they do n't work , they must be reconsidered . granted that you have hurt england , but she is still on her feet . and to seal off her trade with europe , what has it cost you ? you have had to rule with an iron hand . you have turned friends into enemies . and even at that , the result has only been partly effective . you have never been able to stop the extensive cheating , smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials . but i should think the situation in spain , alone , would give your policy a minus balance . you have had to commit a quarter of a <number> of your best troops against the guerrillas , with no victory in sight . and you have given england a dangerous foothold on the continent , for her armies . 
yeah . 
my married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity . i could n't believe it . 
no -- prison is rather agreeable to me , and there is no doubt that after the war , independence will come . my only worry is what shape it will take . <person> has -- 

is that your blood ? 
shhh ! 
naw , they ai n't stayin ' here . but , i know who you 're talkin ' about . they 're stayin ' at the hollywood holiday inn . 
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere . 
children ai n't gon na need to know that kind of thing . 
i know they made me . even got the label on my neck to prove it . 
how long 'til they reach us ? 
what are we going to do ! ? 
you 'd better drive him . he 's a bit shaky . i 'll follow in my car . where is yours ? 
i 'm sorry ... 
it 's probably not a good idea . 
all set ? 
that cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us , just up and took it . <person> , how that baby can run ! 
you ca n't kill me , <person> . i 've got something going this saturday night ... it 's gon na be worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaohs -- and only i can stop it . 
it does n't make any sense . he would n't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy ... not unless it was personal . 
you have your tickets ? 
if we should choose to chew , we 'll be pursued - 
i would have stayed there if i could . 
nevertheless what ' ? <person> will testify and that 'll be enough . 
it ’ s part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .

i 'm me ... i mean , that 's me . 
it 's early . why do we have to go home ? 
it 's a nightclub , not a drive-in , <person> . i do n't follow the customers to the parking lot . 
do you really think your life is meaningless , <person> ? is that why you 're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose ? 
we are traveling to lhasa . may we ... ? 
i hate turkey . 
i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . <person> , i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he 's so ... agaanisish !

she told me you said , `` mama , you want to kill me . '' 
i need to tell you something .

god , it 's late . i should find a hotel ... 
if it 's okay with you i 'm going to <person> 's to do my homework .

this is a fleet-driven operation , son , and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground . you can have everything else , eh ? 
such mortal drugs i have , but <person> 's law is death to any that utters them . 
this is n't the time or the place to get into it , but there is , for just <number> example , a certain former colleague of mine , who made a very big mistake , a life mistake . i think the lesson there is that , old and young , we ail make mistakes , and we have to learn that our actions , all of them , can carry serious consequences . you 're very young , tracy underage , in fact -- but maybe <number> day you 'll understand . 
duets ? but can we trust him ? 
do n't thank me . your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit . 
no . 
you ca n't , it 's too dangerous .

that 's true . <person> <person> was n't really an uncle . he was a business partner of my daddy 's ? and my mama never knew nothin ' about me and him - that 's for damn sure . his real name was somethin ' kind of european , like <person> . but everyone just called him <person> . he came around the house sometimes when <person> was away . i always figured he was sweet on mama , so when he cornered me <number> afternoon , i was surprised more'n a little . 
all right ! tell us about the truck ! 
no . 
i spent <number> years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . <person> was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . <person> does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ? 
this is the best we 're gon na do . 
eddie ... it 's <number> thing to compare <person> <person> to <person> <person> . it 's even okay to claim that <person> <person> <person> is just slightly holier than the pope ... as long as you do n't really believe it ! 
do not inhale . 
why would someone do that ? 
my god , it 's stormy for a piece of rock that size !

no no no , tucker , thank you . 
you should be shocked . or do you get off on this shit ? 
the fitzwilliam botanical garden annual fundraiser . 
how much does she want ? 
major , what do you think could have done this ?

the final countdown . 
what hotel are you staying at ? 
in the same fashion as chess . 
who ? 
<person> ... it 's tearing me apart . 
if you are protecting others of your kind , it will cost you your identity . 
allah be praised . and what battalions will you call upon ? 
oh my god , ... it looks like , it looks like a sarcophagus . 
i remember when i just saw you . skinny winnifred . <person> , you were skinny . 
`` she was nice . '' wow . that makes me all soft inside . ever occur to you she did n't love you back ?

oh , smythe , some bicarbonate of soda , quick - double strength . i know those news mongrels [ <number> ] will upset me . 
do n't be ridiculous . there is no such thing as a portal into someone else 's brain .

if you just listen , you 'll see it 's a damn good idea . the first time i do it they 're lurking about . they see me hand the ten thousand to someone . 
but will you also submit to the decision of the church ? 
they all have names and numbers on them . i wonder what they are ? 
really ? 
how much longer we got ta be shut up in this fuckin ' sweatbox ? 
good swell . 
i never thought <person> was ready for the presidency . but i would never , never consider ... his death was awful , an awful thing for this country . do you ever think of death , <person> <person> ? 
i 'm pretty handy i reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot . 
well , people got ta get by somehow . that 's the curse . the mines done it . all that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! everybody 's got a mother . you do n't rip up your mother . you do n't rip up the earth and take everything out . it 's like the cracker jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want ... . '' ... 
oh no . 
hunh-uh . what 's that ? 
do you remember what just happened ? 
what you want me to call you ? 
after all , you work with a man for a certain length of time , you come to know him , his habits , his values , and so forth . well either he 's the kind who chases after women or he is n't . 
you know better than that . 
i found dad . 
so keep painting . 
i 'm not , but <person> is . 
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , <person> . 
they need to be scanned individually . they each have a bar code , so i need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt ... 
about that shooting last night ... i was there and ... 
the army needs you . 
was the heart attack the result of natural causes ? 
i do n't care what you 've got started . do you want to go ? 
yes . yours . you have n't murdered anybody . you killed mitchell . was n't that an accident ? it must have been . if you kill a blackmailer , you kill him dead -- so that he ca n't talk anymore . 
is it okay if he spends the night ? 
is n't it a fact that the `` <number> other asian men '' in the line-up were all of the classic mongoloid type , whereas <person> has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean ? 
ahh , dr. helburn , why do n't you come in tomorrow-morning at <number> o'clock , that 's when we open , we 'll get you started . 
what is your position ? 
i heard you playing . 
then you should . 
maybe she 's right . 
i actually got some memory back last night . 
a gull smashed into <person> 's front door . <person> ... what 's happening ? 
i 'd love to . but are n't you supposed to meet up with <person> ? 
verbal , you know we 're trying to help you . 
who the fuck is <person> ? <person> , these fucking names ... 
you see what they doing , those posts out there ? putting up another fence , <number> metres on the other side of the one that 's there . we wait until <person> <person> sunday , they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another <number> , ten days . so we going soon as it 's dark . you want -- i mean it -- you can still come . 
i never hurt nobody ... 
i even moved into <person> <person> 's apartment - in case old snoopy <person> might start looking around . 
i do n't care . we 've got ta stop her . 
il est en retard . 
you do n't have to tell everybody about it . pretty soon they 'll all go there and it wo n't be so clean . 
who eats cock ? 
what 's the bad news ? 
where 's mom ? 
say you promise . 
yes you do ... 
yeah , yeah , yeah . 
melissa ... ? 
mrs. stanwyk ! 
yes ? 
i 'll inform dispatch . 
thank you . 
christ , you 're right -- gray makes <person> <person> look like <person> . just have <person> call him . <person> can scare anybody . 
he had no reason to . 
did you say <person> <number> access ? 
i did n't make my move fast enough . that 's it , is n't it ? i was too respectful . 
because you 're the closest . 
someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us . 
where ’ s the sub going ? ! 
is that all ? 
sure . then we had a fight this morning . 
i have paid the penalty . now let 's have some music . 
you ca n't do it alone , ya know . it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good . 
is mom ... in there ? 
valiant ? what 're you doin ' here ? 
no , salvatore . you 'd better go . it 's my father . 
he is ? 
<person> sam 's age need a good deal of discipline , or they walk all over you . 
shelly , do you think i 'm pretty ? 
i dunno , man . after what happened to <person> <person> - - 
what 's <person> ' number ? 
why do n't you quit now , you want out so bad ? 
... so ... anybody special in your life ? 
if you knew why , you might know where to look for him . i do n't envy you this ; he 's not done -- he 's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush . now , i 've done what you asked me . 
she had white shoes . 
how 'bout me what ? 
so , tibet , too , needs to define itself . 
diane , you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments , no strings , because after you get over there , things are going to change . people change . 
this time maybe get a widescreen tv . you 'll be occupied for weeks . 
what do you want ? 
taking over the world is <number> thing . it 's finding good help to run it for you that 's the killer . 
not really . 
uh , let me get back to you ... 
huh ? 
say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ... 
where 's connell ? 
you first . 
how do you do ? i am <person> <person> <person> , but you may call me <person> . 
a real live pimp ? 
do n't do that ! 
i ca n't do this -- 
virgins . 
but he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested . 
when were you all planning to tell me ? a year from now ? after the election ... what 's going on here ? <person> hesitates . 
sean ... 
a parka . 
can you wake up <person> ? i need to talk to her . 
what does the manager say ? 
sure you can , just -- 
<person> ? you okay ? 
let me have some apple pie , <person> . <person> said anything about war ? all i said was that some gulls ... 
do n't recognize him . you were trapped by <person> 's sorcery . 
can it be that easy ? 
helping you -- i just -- 
what the hell was that ? who told you i was five-0 ? 
i think <person> 's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them . 
will you listen , dammit ! 
we have got to talk , and we have got to talk alone . 
torque wrench please . 
the great war ? 
starck , do you know how crazy that sounds ? it 's impossible . 
here . why am i looking at this star ? 
innocent ! 
he 's pretty young for that job . 
you evil son of a bitch . you better hope there 's some thorazine in that bag , because if there 's not , you 're in bad trouble . 
that strikes me as odd . 
that 's it ? probably ? look , sharks are attracted by blood , and thrashing around ... . 
what color is it ? 
<person> left those here . 
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear , do n't forget that . 
but you threw a knife at my head ! 
how do you know i 'm not ? i was cruel to jessica . when i got to know her -- when i found out how empty and ungenerous she was , there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her . 
... yah , well , you stay away from scotty now - 
jeffrey , i do n't think you ought to do it . 
as soon as the doctor lets us , we got ta move you . does he understand that ? we 're supposed to tell him . are you conscious ? 
<person> tubbs . can i come in ? 
parachute . 
who is he ? 
i , i do n't know . 
what do you want with the harbor master ? 
i 'd say nothing . after <number> or <number> , people will try to find a pattern . a reason . 
what 's wrong with you ! ? ! 
pino , relax , will ya . 
not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take . 
i 'm in a wheelchair , the truck sounds pretty good . 
'yes ' is the answer to your question . 
what your mother means , <person> , is that she do n't want folks to think you 're special . 
why do you think you 're here ? 
and who is this ? 
well , that just about figures for today . 
we 've been talking about her , mostly . 
i 'm sure it 's the most generous gift today . 
and who am i hiding from ? 
i 'm ... scared . 
i beg your pardon ? 
i can tell she 's not a killer . you just do n't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation . 
uh-huh . 
you think i 'm gon na spot him 'across a crowded room ? ' that 's <person> <person> you 're thinking about . the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky . he wo n't stop . 
that 's correct . 
i want that bastard dead ! 
good luck , captain . 
he left . i could n't believe it -- he just left ! it 's as if he 's somewhere else ... i 'm only getting a piece of him . 
yes , while he was here . 
how much you wan na bet ? 
mozarella ? never heard of him . 
and when i finally agree to spread my legs , you accuse me of treating you like meat . 
what do you need ? 
and he 's where ? 
that 's just exactly what he has been doing . this deal should have been closed weeks ago . tell him to keep tomorrow open . . . 
yes . 
do you like <person> ? 
right . 
trouble with you , jake , is you have no sense of humor ... . 
gratzman ! -- gratzman ! did you get those biotics ? 
i thought you arrested me . 
... .no ... . 
you ca n't be hungry and scared at the same time . 
oh yeah , you want a seriously righteous hack , you score <number> of those gibsons man . you know , supercomputers they use to like , do physics , and look for oil and stuff ? 
get out of the car , spread them . you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to < u > shut the fuck up < /u > ! you commie motherfucker . either way you 're goin ' to the can . 
seems like i 'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other , does n't it ? 
i thought real men do n't like quiche . 
this is wrong in so many ways . 
oh , i 'm just not lucky <person> . 
there may be <number> ... no , <number> who could fit it . 
they 're yours . but how are you going to finish it ? without a star there 's no movie . 
you mean don ’ t go at all ? what about my internship ? 
<person> , north island . please advise pending further information . over . 
no -- not as a rule . 
this outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded . 
there are more important matters right now ... 
how heroic of you ... 
bring me the scissors . 
the body ? 
what was this <number> ? 
please , do n't you realize ? she is dying . 
you 'd like my room . 
this one 's going to be even more fun . 
you quit . 
... by you ? 
where are we do you think ? 
there 's no island there . we 're wasting our time ! 
the <number> surfer boys ? 
why ? 
i ca n't just hack my way inside . there 's no modem access to the mainframe , it 's in a stand-alone . i 'd have to be physically at the terminal . 
i thought we were starting something ... and then ... i know it 's unorthodox , i mean with you being involved in the case and all . 
listen , i got ta get some better shoes , few other things before tomorrow . why do n't you drop me off at the ren cen , we 'll hook up later ? 
and there is a russian saying : `` the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . '' 
i am serious . if we could get you , the time machine , and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast , we could send you back to the future . 
get off my property . 
oh -- the baron -- the baron . 
stuttering <person> ! stuttering <person> ! 
it will ? how do you figure ? 
but eh what was the matter with him ? 
can i give you a ride to your car ... ? 
what do you suggest ? 
can you imagine , if <person> did kill <person> , what must that be like ? to wake up every morning , how can you ? just wake up and be a person , drink a coffee ... ? 
another , frank ... ? 
i knew what you meant . 
all it says is that it 's above the vulva ... but where the hell is the vulva ? 
i believe you , austin . let 's go . 
bad sportsmanship . a ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues . they just ca n't stand seeing the other fellow win . if these people would just play the game , instead of standing on the touch line heckling - 
what do you want on it ? 
i did n't know where else to keep it . where would you ? 
what 's wrong ? 
if you 're worried about anything , let 's take that blood test of yours . 
not even a chance they punched through ? you found a hole . 
wan na know how i did that ? 
you 've got your <number> guns strapped on . you 're ridding off on another adventure ? oh , my god , it 's all real ... it really is real . i should go with you . please ... 
who was <person> seeking ? tell me ! did he try to enter the palace ? 
permission to speak freely , sir ? 
morning , <person> . bummer about the store . you insured ? 
`` it worked for <person> <person> . <person> 's kiss and make up . '' 
i 'm sure glad i 'm hearing all this now , before it 's too late ! 
leave . 
he ai n't seen < u > nothin ' < /u > yet . 
rats ... 
well , we spent enough time building the damn thing , might as well use it . 
now , <person> , i said i would keep you company , but i meant right here and now . 
what did she say about me ? 
yes , <person> has hers . 
go then . i ca n't let you put it in me now but i want you . i like you . 
the water 's going putrid in the barrels . 
all you do is profit from another man 's misery ! 
why don ’ t you let me take this <number> , <person> ? 
okay , okay . you 'll have it by the end of the week , how 's that ? 
you 'll have the money . how do i know that you wo n't -- 
who 's <person> <person> ? 
oh . 
`` most fruitful yuki '' ? what is ... oh my god , she 's a pregnant superhero ! 
i 've asked him to try and locate the site . okay with you ? 
i 'm going to see what the hell happened . 
there < u > is < /u > no b-2 bomber , 
<person> did n't want it around . after . 
there ca n't be very much- 
who ? 
i 've considered that . 
nothing ... nothing at all ! 
honey ? how did it go ? you did n't call me . 
... who ? ... did she say how far apart the pains were ? ... when was that ? ... oh dear . 
i thought you were going to be late- 
but i have to go out . something 's happening out there . 
it was . what sadness lengthens <person> 's hours ? 
you 're full of ifs . 
`` soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer , thus banished from thy presence with reproach , and fettered by thy rigorous command , not to appear again before thy beautiful face . <person> princess , to remember this thy faithful slave , who now endures such misery for love of thee '' ... . 
what does that have to do with it ? she do n't look <number> to me . i heard somethin ' with <person> . she was with him once or somethin ' , i think . it was like some blonde . that 's the <number> ... 
by the way , i 'm not much of a pool player . 
all right , settle down . all this money ai n't ours . 
i 'd strongly advise you to join us -- 
expensive hangover . 
he was the orderly , during dr. lechter 's stay in prison . 
i want us to be together . but i need to know you 're serious about turning over a new leaf . i need a sign . 
that 's right . 
what guys do . 'nother order . 
what ? 
did we win or lose , i mean -- ? 
we ca n't just assume they 're standing by to receive <person> <number> months from launch . i 'd have to write in an aglet . 
sooooo ... she 's pretty good in bed , then ? 
if you 'd seen the blood on his head -- and some body had to carry him out to sea -- 
come on . 
i do n't know . 
they 're good , norm , but you 're better'n them . 
current levels may not be sufficient . 
no , you gave a very convincing performance . and you 'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse . 
you must think i like losing . 
so this is the young man ? 
you got everything you need ? 
i see . and what do you do for a living , <person> <person> ? 
we do n't think this place is safe . 
i 'm sorry , <person> , but you have to run again . 
you think skipper and alice do it ? 
you ca n't . you 're afraid ! 
how ? 
leave her alone ! 
is it a charge , sir ? 
<person> , <person> . you 'll have to stay here and guard the horses . 
<person> millaney . 
whadaya say ? 
<person> 's signalling he 's ok . 
then you 'll die . 
'dis ? ' 'dis ? ' you 're not in a position to 'dis ' , or 'give props ' , or whatever your real world sense of fucking decorum tells you to do . you 're nothing . you 're wallpaper . you 're not here to make fucking friends . asking a motherfucker where he lives . and who the fuck told you 'red dragon ' ? . 
do n't worry , <person> . me and <person> have been friends a long time , he ai n't gon na shoot . we like each other too much . 
it 's a beautiful picture of her . 
stop being so fucking melodramatic ! if it was murder he 'd still be locked up or on parole , in which case he would n't be allowed to leave the state . 
a convent ? they put me in a convent ? what 's the problem ? was n't there any more room in hell ? 
are you marked like this ? ? 
demons ? i do n't know what to tell you . it sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me . the problem , <person> , is that you have no context for it . you 're a renegade existentialist suf- fering demons a <number> years after freud . how the hell am i supposed to make it fit ? 
christ , and i even know somebody at the phone company -- 
what are we delivering ? 
dylan , where 's the man ? 
looks like this is goodbye . 
okay . 
so did my father and his father before him . 
of course ! well , we got a big day planned for you ... first , we 're gon na start off a little easy , with you in that armchair over there . then , once you 're up to speed and cooking , we 'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment -- 
let 's just skip it . it is probably nothing anyway . 
we should be going -- 
prettier than <person> ? 
hardly the case , senator . 
is this how it went , <person> ? 
whatsamatter ? 
oh . well , we can fix up <number> of <person> 's for you tomorrow night . <person> insists an <person> <person> . 
you won it . you 're going to study at the finest institute at england , the toughest fellowship in the country , and you won . 
do you realize what i can create with a single strand of <person> 's hair ! 
santini will do that for <number> dollars ! 
... out here , captain . do n't you think the guys deserve a break ? 
he goes to college with me ! 
um , i-i did n't really want to , you know , go to a sperm bank or something , have some anonymous donor . i-i just , you know , i-i-i would n't want that . 
leave them drums alone . 
oh my , yes ! this is a *far* superior taste -- and crisp , too ! you know , so many apples are disappointingly mealy . i wonder of most of the apples in my life were n't meant for pies ! 
hold it , hold it ... 
bugger off . 
you know if i were accused of carving up <number> people , i 'd take the opportunity to skip school . 
hi there , little brother . 
my husband is a proud man , sir . he would be furious if he knew i 'd come . 
this thing works . we could go home right now . 
i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours . 
candaules 
come on ! 
with your skin , i prefer crimson . 
hey , it 's me . this guy from l.a. , <person> <person> is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff , he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever -- 
you 're done . end of story . 
... arty farty ! 
uh ... i hate to break it to you <person> , but i do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor , and unless you took a learning annex course i do n't know about , i 'm pretty sure you do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either . 
what is it ? 
yeah . the boss sent me over to offer you a job . he wants you to write a daily column on the tribune . 
what do you want , <person> ? flowers ? i 'll send you some flowers . 
what the hell are you doing ? you could 've killed me ! 
come on down ! 
what ? 
maybe if you quit running around after other women you would n't have so much trouble with this <number> . 
b.f.d . what do you plan to do ? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy . 
you know , i want to thank you for getting me into this class ... no way was my old man going to spring for the fees ... 
did you tell her that you loved her ? 
ninety . 
how old is <person> <person> ? 
looks like you need a haircut to me . 
how 'd you get that . 
<person> ? where are you going ? 
oh . how old ? 
i 've seen some sickening shit . i do n't blink twice anymore , especially in your case . 
position , <person> of prey ? 
that 's exactly right , <person> . so the question as i see it is n't `` why should you work for n.s.a . '' it 's `` why should n't you ? '' 
cobb 's right . i must n't talk to anybody . 
`` guessing '' is not in my nature ... 
we 'll raid the ace the moment we get a warrant . 
how 'bout another cup of coffee ? 
hmm . i 'd say <number> , maybe <number> . 
thank you , your honor . <person> : ms. costello is a rebuttal witness . as a 'surprise <person> ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here . 
you did n't say find them . you said , `` get them . '' 
my name is clarence , and what is yours ? 
what a ridiculous thing to say . 
but most important , man , i 'm sorry about what i said . i was drunk ... my adrenaline was going ... 
yeah . that 's right , <person> . those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them . 
with <number> or <number> days ' practice , you 'll be able to use it as well as i can . then we 'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here . 
wrong number . 
nobody 's that unhappy . 
i know this . what do you want ? 
i ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music . 
we were here <number> christmases ago . 
baby , i know it is . it 's a black diamond trail ... 
i got ta have more'n ten . i got ta have fifty-seven dollars . 
hardly anything . i was n't sure from your letter what was bullshit , and what was n't . 
could you fill me in ? 
which way ? 
no , maybe not though . that , that 's what i 'm trying to say . 
we had pictures put on , that way everybody knows who everybody was ! 
who ? 
this whole week has gone sour . it is n't turning out like it was supposed to . i want to go home . 
how 's the case going ? 
you ca n't make me stop caring ... 
<person> wo n't bring the bloody thing back , will it , <person> <person> ? 
i do n't know . those men killed <person> to get it . but he must not have had it with him on the train . 
oh boy . 
good morning ! 
look , fuck the thesis . i think there 's a book here . your photographs and my research , together . 
this is comrade kopalski . 
please , <person> <person> , you 're a great humanitarian . ai n't you heard what it 's like in them jails ? you send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and ... 
i 'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant . an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy . but it was pure wishful thinking on her part . the girl can never have children , she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated . 
next week ? 
it 's me or wallace , <person> . <person> 's third party is only going to help mcgovern . i need your support . 
no . 
this is the last thing she 'll ever write . she 'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss . 
or your fucking wife , you know . 
why did you tell us he shot everybody , <person> ? you put him in for <number> murders , the man saved your life -- 
there 's a bunch of kids day-sailing that way . turn them back to port . 
is it me you 're hiding from them or the other way around ? 
that 's right . and we nailed over a thousand of them . we did it by crunching data . good crime-scene work , good lab work , good data-base analysis . <person> had to tackle a car once . you getting the signal , special agent ? 
sure . 
innocuous ? 
lady ... 
my math program . the superintendent said he 'd fund it . 
i do n't know . 
well yeah ... i know that . 
the death star will be completed on schedule . 
uh ... gym . 
rose . <person> <person> <person> . 
i do n't how much i went -- but i was enrolled . i was such a loser back then . i was -- misguided , pathetic -- i was very fat . not even close to what i am today . not the frank tj mackey you 're eager to talk to because i was swimming in what < u > was < /u > as opposed to i < u > wanted < /u > . 
on what ? 
took it this morning . 
<number> drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops . <person> , i bore myself silly . let 's talk about you . how the hell did you wind up in corto maltese ? 
who 's gon na tell mitchell ? 
we better stick here till tonight . 
yeah ? ! well ... i loved her too . 
sir -- 
were they trying to kill you ? * 
<number> things i hate . street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs . 
<number> <number> thousand . no ... <number> <number> thousand . 
we 're leaving -- case dismissed for lack of evidence . maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we 're going to graduate with no thesis . 
i 'll settle for a third of that . 
why did he go in the house ? 
<number> years ago . 
well great . the pleasantville marathon starts at <number> thirty . 
in a sense . 
this thing means that much to y ... 
did you and dad have any other property ? 
aw , girl . do n't cry ... me and you , we got more yesterday than anybody . we need some kind of tomorrow ... 
oh , he 'll get married , do n't worry , <person> <person> . 
no , <person> . i do n't read the papers . 
where 's <person> ? 
jeez , <person> , tapped the phone ? you think so ? 
i 'll be away a lot . 
yep . 
good morning ... 
so you do n't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural ? 
just them ? 
you bet i did . 
they think you 're in fairbanks . if not , they still wo n't find you before the plane comes tomorrow . 
pull out . 
excuse me <person> , i 'm sorry , i just wan na let you know that the flowers were delivered . and the room 's all set up . 
your majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me . this is a crucial point -- and it is a political <number> , which your majesty will be in a far better position to answer than i . can napoleon afford to abandon moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you ? 
yeah . <person> <person> was parked outside the window .

we got information that there 's no shit in the street -- it 's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well . 
oh , well , i can not communicate with you ! i , you know , i never realized you were such a tightass . mickey i ca n't understand you . your sisters , both sisters have such good taste in music . i do n't know where you went , went wrong .

if you tell him , you 'll probably make summer associate . who cares about <person> ? think about yourself . 
i opened thousands of brains . 
beer and weed is what i 've got . 
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends . 
maybe . or maybe somebody 's finally caught up with us . somebody with a grudge . thought you might want to spread the word . 
you 'll break your neck on that ice . 
that 's how you get to know someone . did it hurt when you got it ? 
perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched . 
you are young , inexperienced . you do not know what time can do . how it can sap all pity , all love . 
-- your mother , <person> bless her , stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - i assume you 're talking here about divorce ? the very thought -- 
in other words you do n't know . 
good for you , <person> . 
you know the thing i hate most about children ? 
i 'm all excited -- 
well , this pate is rather ... unusual . 
just some scary movie .

but look , i 'm president of the company now and i -- 
all right . get a hold of yourself . take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are . 
you wo n't be able to drag anything from her that way . you also must realize that many of my colleagues are ... well , scared ... 
use your other hand ! grab it ! 
a parrot ... let it go . 
i saved you from the lorry and you 're not very special . 
as far away as i ever want to be .

booties for my father . he gets cold in this hospital . 
i 've seen it . it 's all pain .

well , until we know exactly what it is , nobody goes outside , understood ? 
we never should have done this to him ... 
tea . 
you want a drink ? 
<person> ! 
sure , <person> = mc squared . until you factor in more than <number> dimensions . then ... damn . hit us again . 
i think he was working on them today , so they 're probably in his office . could you find them and see who they belong to ? 
we 're going to take him over to my private office . where 's our phone ? 
my boss .

like i said we were friendly , not friends .

the falkner sisters are rather timid , your honor , and wish to be together . if the court pleases , i will only have <number> of them testify . 
well , that 's to be expected . they have to understand . these are start-up problems . this is n't pots and pans , this is a precise business . i 'll write them a letter . 
would you remember his name ? 
if you want to see us you must come later . 
i would n't be so sure about that . he did it with you . he 's a man now . 
well , he 's still running the show , ai n't he , dad ? 
<person> mickey . we 've never been introduced , but i 'm <person> <person> . i do n't know if you 've ever heard of me or remember me . i was <number> of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial -- - 
time to go . 
they 're afraid of our light . that means we do n't have to be so afraid of them . 
what is it ? 
oh my god , i 've dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl . 
rekall ? 
everything is wrong . 
this is all firefly 's fault -- that idiot , that fool ... 
i never saw anything like it . how did she pick him up so fast ? 
maybe we should go in a different room ? 
<person> has just awaken . 
what did it say ? 
what 's wrong ? 
<person> <number> , detention block a-23 , cell <number> . she 's still alive ... 
this behavior will stop at once .

all we 've got to do is make it to the top . 
what are you doing here ? 
i 'll take <person> . it 's faster .

do you want to make love ? you 're absolutely beautiful , those eyes , that expression . you 're absolutely the most sexy thing alive . do you want to make love ?

why me ? 
but that 's impossible ! ! <person> asked her out ! he had to ! i saw him walk her home ! oh , <person> ! 
timmy , listen to dr. grant !

hildy ! 
unless we get a postcard or somethin ' , that 's my guess . 
him . 
and did you lose her ? did she go ? 
not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training . 
i do n't want him caring about his wife ! what about the vice president ! 
that 's okay . 
but if there can be no arrangement , then we are at an impasse . 
that 's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes ... ... when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick ... 
consuelo . are you crying ? 
what 's wrong with it ? 
to talk to you .

that is n't for the divers actually . it 's for the balloon . it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator . without it , with the pressure at the bottom , the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed . 
it was n't 'till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they were n't gon na shoot unless we shot first . when we got out of the stairwell , i remember thinking , 'oh my god . this might work . ' but <person> knew it would work all along . there was n't any doubt in his mind . it 's not like there was and he just did n't show it . he knew it would work . 
okay .

you 're afraid of him . 
kaboom . 
well , he never done this before , but seein ' as it 's special circumstances and all , he says i can knock <number> hunnert off that trucoat .

there 's nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized . 
you get yourself a regular job , as satan 's disciple .

frank ... 
i 've heard the carpenters before . <person> drummer and freaky dude . not unlike the white stripes . 
thank you , your honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana , u.s. <number> point <number> and <number> through <number> of the uniform code : 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' and , your honor , having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the xerox form .

how was dinner ? 
yeah ? 
what are you going to do ? 
how did i get in the house ? how did i get into my bed ?

are you hungry ? 
yeah . 
so do i . 
look for antiques ... 
vincenzo , that fat motherfucker , <person> 's right hand . he 's the one who set me up . then he went around shooting his mouth off , telling everyone i was as good as dead . he goes in there every wednesday night around <number> , he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer . never misses . 
my head hurts . 
if i tell you i did n't , <person> , that 's what i mean . 
all these years , happy as we 've been , how i prayed and prayed he 'd see fit to give us a child . and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot ... no one must ever know . 
made no sense . scared out of their minds , and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips . <person> . 
what ? 
shh ! is that so hard to believe ? 
karla , i just wanted the whole thing to be over . i did n't want to involve anybody else . 
what do you want to tell me ? 
a lotta people would n't have tried . it was pretty brave even trying ... 
<person> . 
i 'm probably going to make out with her first before we , you know , get down ... 
i know the feeling . 
trust me , you 're the best . 
you sure have to hand it to those guys . 
that 's what i told them . 
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show . 
what ? 
fallacy . 
are you having trouble raising the half <number> ? 
damn ... . <person> ! we 've been so lucky . we have the <number> perfect whales in our hands , but if we do n't move quickly , we 'll lose them ! 
go away . 
i do n't know . 
what ? 
hello , <person> . 
he sees himself in me ! <person> <person> , a young man of verona . 
hey . 
it 's so nice . 
but if they < u > do < /u > ? 
perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer . 
please let me know when you hear from daddy , get a number or something . 
it 's for the mining industry , <person> <person> . we can talk about business later . but first , let me slip into something more comfortable . 
he 's a barman . whatever . do you mind if i continue ? 
then fight back . <person> yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth . 
yeah , sure , i guess ... 
my son ? i ai n't got no son . you <person> ? 
are you sure ? 
that 'd be up on your shoulder , maybe your lower back . 
how did <person> <person> react to that ? 
of course not ! 
okay . how you doing ? 
you broke it ? you know the source ? 
`` why are we here ? is that what you 're asking , <person> ? ... why are we here ? no why . just here '' . 
you sure you do n't want a lift back home ? 
this man 's friends ai n't gon na look favorably on his incarceration . 
what are you boys up to ? 
i love that belt . what are you , about a fifty big and tall ? 
we have a zero bug attacking all the login and overlay files . 
i ca n't be honest with them . 
letters in the alphabet . 
know and love ? 
is there anybody else here ? 
what was better ? i made better bait ? 
`` we '' being the behavioral science unit , at quantico . you 're <number> of <person> <person> 's , i expect . 
it made me feel like you could see inside of me . and i do n't know how that 's possible . 
so <person> <person> , tell me , when you climbed k2 , did you base camp at 25- or <number> feet ? 
that was beautiful . 
what ? what ? what ? what ? what ? 
... stole a truck under arrest . 
hi , <person> , i 'm just working . 
it 's all fuzzy . 
<person> ? 
listen , vanessa , whatever happens , i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl . i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden , i do n't know what happened . the whole time i was shagging her -- i mean really shagging her , i mean it was crazy , i was like a huge mechanical piston , in and out , in and out ! -- 
then what ? 
no , not recently . i 'm sure of that . 
you the magician ? 
what 's with you ? 
were you always funny ? 
`` then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe . '' 
well , the best , the money-is-no-object best , for a criminal case , any lawyer would tell you <person> <person> . out of sacramento . <number> , i do n't know how you 're fixed for money . 
i think it 's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat . 
alright , personalised flight care from corey . <person> , cassettes , magazines , anything ? 
like a grateful dead concert . 
will you marry me ? 
everything that 's happened since <person> <person> disappeared . the phone calls and the -- 
do n't you die on me ! ! this is <person> <person> quilt . is that what you planning ! ? 
no . i was just researching . <person> down . 
when you did n't come to the club . 
who the hell is this `` they ? '' 
utapan , wo n't you speak to me ? you used to know how to speak to me . 
jesus , i 'd go nuts if i had to work in an office all day . 
she 's obviously that . <person> ! <person> would you rather have , a <number> dollars or <number> of sissy 's thumbs full of pennies ? 
hi , <person> -- 
it 's all part of our safety regulations . you see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then ... well ... 
-- i already get the post . i do n't need another subscription . 
the brush-off , huh ? 
trubshaw again ? what now ? 
that 's absurd on the face of it , <person> <person> ! he 's talking like a child . 
probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall . he worked a lotta time on this . 
fifty shillings . pounds . 
no . 
colonel <person> pulled the strings , and put me on loan to the r.a.f . they need pilots , and we need experience . i leave tomorrow . 
what ? 
how long do we have ? 
so i 'll talk to him about it . 
no , sir . 
she watches ... she listens . 
whatever , at this point all i care about is food . i 'm starving and i got a fucking killer headache . 
oh , shit , shit , shit - i do n't know about all this ! you sure ? ! 
they come after you ? 
lloyd . <person> <person> , i 've got you . 
i do n't know -- few hours , i guess . 
whooey -- he took a run-out powder . 
you do n't drink ? 
what 's going on , <person> ? 
never read a book in my whole life . 
i must be outta my mind . <person> , quit it . 
well ? 
there are no saints today . good people yes , but extraordinarily good people ... those i 'm afraid we are sorely lacking . 
no , i 've got it . 
do n't threaten me . i tend to take these things seriously . and get a couple hours sleep . you look like day old shit . 
because he 's forced out at third ! it 's a force ! 
i gave blood before and , uh ... clothing to the poor . 
oh yeah ? well , if you 're ever in the mood for a history lesson , i 'm your teacher , understand ? 
yeah . we just go home . 
you mean profanity . that 's simply the way they talk here . nobody pays any attention to you if you do n't swear every other word . you 'll find it in all the literature of the period . 
had a feeling it was you . 
it 's perfectly safe . i promise . 
i have no idea - i just want to ... 
where 'd you learn to fight like that ? 
what 's your malfunction , <person> ? 
oooooo . 
well , you 're a tower of support . 
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project . we are in little danger of being left alone for long . you 'll need to do something . otherwise they 'll be sending someone out to recover you . 
you 're taking this too far , <person> . 
fundamentals ? 
moving along quite well . 
with you there 's a tragic dimension . 
he 's wrong , you know -- about <person> , lbj , <person> . 
you know me home . me name . 
of course not . 
honey this is <person> <person> . 
we got ta get his money so we can get outta here -- we got ta -- 
why not ? 
with <person> <person> , when he was young . 
in anticipation of making you sick . 
chief ... . 
was n't that ship destroyed ? 
now look what you did ! 
-- i do n't want your trophy and i do n't give a shit about it ! 'cause i knew you when ! ! you and <person> and <person> <person> . i knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and did n't know what side of the bed to piss on ! 
vigi , <person> , <person> -- you have been a bad little monkey . 
<person> got my son , little <person> , involved with <person> <person> , and it was great . 
yeah ? 
i told you not to make that deal , <person> ! 
i mean i 'm dreaming about going all out , crazy shit . 
it 's freezing out . 
quincy , i told you about these fat-ass girls . 
he 's my brother . 
what , sebastian ? 
what about her ? 
what 's with the chewing gum ? 
she 's very tired , poor creature . you know me : i 'm a real pig . it 's not so easy cleaning up after me . 
it 's so very cold ... 
i do n't want to . 
dinner at my place then ? say , <number> o'clock ? 
my wife always said i had a problem trusting people . 
yeah , my dad 's great . he took me to the zoo . 
it would 've had to have been recently -- within a few weeks . 
you think i do n't know you held out on the d.a. ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? i can be on the phone to <person> <person> in ten minutes . 
the < u > women < /u > ? 
i 'm paying people just to wait for you . it 's ridiculous ! 
did n't you forget something ? 
yes , i 'm your little volga boatman . 
it used to make me laugh .but . 
i have to go . 
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they were n't kept separate i learned to my cost . 
<number> minutes . 
sit down , woman , sit down . you like me , do n't you ? 
<number> . 
jump in the water ! ! 
you do n't understand ! the octopus is supposed to live in a < u > lake < /u > ! 
i 'm going out for awhile . 
you should n't be driving . where are you ? 
what kind of car do you have , <person> ? 
yes ... ? 
hobart , what are you people doing here ? 
but 
you mean , you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword , and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ? 
right here . a minute ago . 
what d'you got ? 
when you go , i go . 
we 're sorry , ma'am . we got a little carried away . 
why ? what 's wrong with me ? 
perhaps it would surprise you to know that i have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child ... 
then i started losing my taste for it . <person> usually means your time is up . but then i realized it was something entirely different ... i started getting the sneaking , dark suspicion that maybe there was ... meaning to life . 
rayisha . 
so does <person> . so does <person> <person> . you told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse . 
yeah . 
mrs. <person> had a son , maybe he could help you . i have his card somewhere . do you mind stepping inside , while i looks for it ? 
yes -- 
who would find out ? 
no ! we 're an independently funded expedition . 
look . we ca n't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him . good night ! no telling what that screwball might do . i walked in yesterday—here he is , standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting . take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces ! 
i have been to the dark side . i have seen a world that no man should ever see . 
all over . <person> <person> up there . it 's against the law . they shoot us . you sure you looking for your friends , man ? 
what are you doing ? 
and what ritual would that be ? 
you know so much about killing why do n't you do it yourself ? 
i will not leave without the twins . 
i did n't . you gave me a look ! 
yes , well , my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention ... negative attention is attention . like when women whack you on the street because of your column , that 's negative attention . 
got any spare change ? how 'bout a spare twenty ? 
may i ask why ? 
i believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish , their law no longer has rightful authority over us . all they have over us is tyranny , then . and i 'll stay here no longer . no force on earth will keep me here ... <person> caught leavin ' the fort could be shot . so each man make your own decision ... those who are goin ' , be back here in an hour . 
ask it ! 
there was n't time for anything else . 
then why are n't you teaching ? why are n't you in a university ? 
what about it ? 
ray , we 're just friend . 
it must be difficult having lots of wives . 
yeah . <person> , i 'll be sendin ' you the money from now on . 
general , would you mind making my excuses at our table ? i 'll be back in a few moments . 
they tried to kill you ? 
slow down ! 
can i help you ? 
you reckless imbecile . this place is ours for the taking and you let yourself ... twelve <number> years old and you act like a child . 
having a kid changes everything . i mean , there 's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings ... 
hey man , i 'm sorry . i 'm just trying to help . 
a dirty frame ! 
you do n't live around here , do you ? 
disaster , disaster lurks behind every palm tree . 
that <person> was working on . yeah . he thought <person> needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so franky finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him 'franky , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he ca n't be comforted . he tells the boys at stearns and <person> they 've disappointed him , he 's going to the judge to rat them out . 
do n't you see ... 
are you going to get remarried ? 
where ? 
i feel the same way . what next ? 
you know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer . 
do n't you believe it . 
and you were n't shocked ? 
misery 's <person> ? 
thank you.. i accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again . 
that 's a lotta crap . 
what 's the boom boom room ? 
which ought to be about <number> hours more , i 'd say . 
wha -- ? 
it 's just what he used to say . 
your place ? 
who else is left ? 
here ? in this house ? 
all right ! if you insist on being an idiot , i 'm not going to waste time coaxing you . how about you ? 
yeah . well , i do . 
yeah . 
you might want to put a jacket on him , it 's getting cold . 
you know ... you could say thank you . 
yup . 
aisha , you are the bear , stalwart and bold . 
hey , have you seen <person> lately ? 
but then you 'll forget about me . 
thought you had to use some of these . 
i think i 'm gon na just get this for today . i 'm in kind of a hurry . would you mind ringing this up while i change out of it ? 
i do n't agree . no one can make a reasonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him . no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met . 
hi , babe . come on . i 've got a couple of things i want to tell you . 
call me back . 
anything in it ? 
you what ? 
yeah . 
they 've turned off the ventilation system . they 're calling him to dinner . 
you 're shittin ' me . you know the beach boys ? ! 
ow ! ! you ca n't do this to me ! ! this is n't fair ! ! ! you sons a bitche -- 
gretchen . we 're going together now . 
i do n't think so , <person> . we 've just had word that the president is out of danger . it seems i did n't kill him after all . 
yeah sure i 'll grab something before i go ... hey -- i 've got a surprise . 
you better not , <person> . 
i will . 
well , i 'm off to a pretty good start . 
penicillin . at least it will help keep his fever down . 
i was shot twice in the back . 
<person> , it will not be easy . 
why are we landing ? 
give it to me ! ! ! 
no , calvin , you 're favorite . 
good . who ? 
our numbers are through the roof . the ipo 's tracking at fifty , sixty a share . the bank 's <number> times oversubscribed -- 
ca n't do it with both hands ? 
<number> reels , sevens across , <number> fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots ? do you have any idea what the odds are ? 
dea ex machina ... 
it 's from the first world war , is n't it ? 
money . 
touche . 
what happend , what 's going on ? 
uh -- well , yes , uh just in terms of the men up there now , my team , he 's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so -- 
you know , <person> , you 've been something of a total asshole the past few days . 
no , <person> . i do n't . 
really , this is n't funny . 
i think they 're gon na arrest me . 
good theory . but i like my mother . i have no aversions to what she does . 
sexual tension ... 
that sucks . why wo n't he go down ? 
what makes you say that ? 
win ? 
<person> <number> dollars . <number> <number> . we gon na let this guy just take it from us ? <number> guy ? 
noinch , noinch , noinch-smoking weed , smoking weed ! doing coke ! drinking beers ! a pack of wraps , my good man . it 's time to kick back , drink some beers , and smoke some weed ! 
goddamnit , tell me what you < u > know < /u > . did the cops go in ? did smith have the disks ? 
it 's not really something i think about . 
listen , ahh - - 
you have n't heard from him , have you , dad ? 
and it does n't cramp your style ? 
no , sir . 
that 's right . 
where is she ? 
ah ! and what sort of man is this worshiper ? 
that 's too bad . 
y'know , i 'm sort of psychic . 
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago , we just hit the jackpot . 
is she sleeping or ... ? 
those were police laboratory people , they 've been over the apartment . 
you know , i do n't even know if you 've got a young man in your life ? 
i know . 
this is too much . i ca n't handle this . 
my daughter , <person> , died when she was <number> . that was long ago . you 're only the woman who keeps care of me . i know you . 
i ca n't help it . i ca n't tell a soul . i did n't even tell <person> . 
i do n't love you . 
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point , then ... ? 
you 've got a legitimate job . 
who the fuck are you ? 
if there is only <number> way out for us , there is only <number> way in for them . 
my name 's grant . <person> <person> . 
stop it . 
no , just a minute or <number> .. i knocked on your door - no one home , so i followed the music .. 
it was in the cellar . <person> . 
thank you , <person> . 
of course it was . otherwise i 'd be breaking and entering . that 's a felony . 
and they 're sure he did n't get tangled under the outboard somehow ? 
<person> <person> , in public relations , and <person> <person> , in mortgage and <person> -- they 'd both like to have you transferred to their departments . 
... i was <number> of a group of ... 
what 's the matter with you , <person> ? why are you so sensitive all of a sudden ? 
i 'm just kidding . 
friend of his . they play duets together . 
they found him . <person> fucker was practically blown in half -- 
hear what ? 
get out -- 
a phillips head . from the toolbox . 
that is repugnant . you have the habits of a goat . 
it was incredible . he came back , made a pompous little bow and said , 'my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish . ' and he 's promised not to talk to the press . 
a fucking wheelchair ? 
on the bed ! 
your 'faith ' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger , only smaller . 
what ? 
there 's still a way . 
shut up . 
i 've worked with it . i 've seen cures . it is at least a hope . 
is that really what you want to ask me ? 
real genuine guy . 
i do n't like talking bad about the dead , but now that he 's gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i would n't have . and yes , she , of all people , was the one who defended him . and that 's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry . 
because -- mrs. robinson this is the sickest , most perverted thing that ever happened to me . and you do what you want but i 'm getting the hell out . 
i should say you had . at the rate you <number> are going , we 'll have to leave the country to save our faces . 
who ? 
you spit on me ! 
leave us alone right now . 
i 'm going with you . 
so . do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information ? 
ever so nice . are n't you , <person> ? 
you were right . it 's nothin ' like i thought . i almost wish ... 
i got a card from your uncle phil in los angeles today , said he went body surfing . 
the duke is to be addresses as ... -- kynes comes forward and adjusts the duke 's suit , checking seals and pulling on straps . 
you find yourself wearing a ... 
got a little lucky . 
but <person> told me that you were n't in favor of the strike . 
<person> mulder -- 
ca n't sit all day on that sofa . need to get your legs strong . 
where the guy jumped and you almost fell . no , you never told me that story . 
yeah it turned out okay . we applied for a national historical plaque for it . that 'll be the third <number> on main street . 
it was just a voice . 
seymour ! hello ! what are you doing here ? 
well , sir , i putter . 
what if nobody stops for us ? 
and they want me to make up for it . 
are n't you a plucky little -- ? 
what ? 
i do n't let anybody call me that . 
<person> drew tell you everything ? 
this is wednesday . 
a man does n't always mean the things he says . 
m'hm . 
well , who are you , then ? 
you do n't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws ! 
i think it 's an energy form , sir ... 
oh ... now <person> wants to be a high roller . 
why ? 
what was i doin ' up there makin ' a speech , anyway ? me ? huh ? gee , the more i think about it the more i could . . . 
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin ' bullet that i saw him take . so do n't be calling him a rat .

`` escape '' ? 
ai n't no one seen him . 
you love <person> , do n't you ? 
but , <person> ... 
i do n't think that has anything to do with -- 
jesus , when was the last time we played the mallory ? 
well , there 's always people you do n't know at these things , but i ca n't say there was anybody particularly suspicious ... wait . there was <number> guy . <person> fella . claimed to be a jockey .

`` that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half <person> . '' 
... then what is this `` you say '' shit , what is that ? what is that ... ? 
uh-huh . 
my father used to have a saying , <person> -- `` god sees the truth , but waits . '' 
about the accident .

room service speaking . 
forgers do it all the time . they take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit i.d . usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it .

this is noble , sir . his wife is crippled . his children are on the brink of starvation . 
yes , it is . 
we find , in the valley , it makes for better happiness among the natives . we rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience . as a result , our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy .

i need <number> <number> dollars in cash ... more important , i need a friend who has people in high places ; a friend who can guarantee that if <number> of my employees be arrested , they would get only light sentences . be my friend . 
i do -- maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty . 
so , it 's worth the wait , right ? what can i do ? rent a huey ? have an airlift ? it 's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule 's asshole , right ? how many peasants would that take ? a line stretching from here to mexico city -- 
my love ... because i love you .

i said i would ... 
excuse me , i 'm talking to you . 
oh , she bit her dog , eh ? 
you do n't seem to be listening . i asked do you have any friends ? 
<person> 's dad -- he 's been talking about bringing me into his property business . showing me the ropes . and that 's something , considering how long it took him to get over i 'm not armenian . so i 'm thinking about it . but i do n't know , might get a little incestuous . but <person> does pretty well . a lot of high-end commercial stuff . 
i thought you might . 
you disappointed in me ? 
oh , no no no ! it 's just the horn resounding is ... 
what do you want ? 
sixteen weeks is a long time . 
... commercially prohibited . number twelve shot in liquid teflon in a copper casing . on impact it all opens up in the target . expect the recoil . they 're hot loads . body armor ?

honey , what if i 'm wrong ? what if i just do n't have it ? 
how 'bout a western ? people love westerns .

<person> ! 
all right , now , tell me about <person> . 
now what ? 
no one in rome has ever heard of him . do you want to remind those few in the senate who have ? the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with . forget about him . 
i show , you give me the information ? 
it was yellow . 
only you ... 
me and those <number> witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over chicago . 
i know . but you 've never met . it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him . 
norman , this is n't about you . this is something that 's happening to me . it 's not to get even ... and it 's not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not ... 
howdy . 
actually , it is kind of rough . 
you do n't kiss like that . <person> and goodbye , that 's all you do .

you 're not upset that i brought the dog ? 
not the compromised second draft . and then i , uh . . . ever hear of the seattle seven ? 
are you nuts ? they 'll fry us for sure . there 's no way we 're doin ' that , you understand ? no way . 
nope . my father 's never clenched a fist in his entire life ! 
good evening ... can we pass ? 
you 're not real . none of this is . 
... you give us a ride in the cessna you got hangared at the pumping station , we 'll be in fairbanks in a few hours . 
i do n't know . i was thinking ... maybe the <number> of us might partner up -- guns for hire , that sort of thing . 
yes , of course . it was quite a while after . i was just out of grade school when they did that . 
my name is <person> . <person> medical examiner . 
but you work for the casino ? 
but i do n't want it straightened out . 
i did n't make it ... 
oh . yeah . yeah . well ... i 'm fine . things are great here . <person> 's going to get me a job at the tv station . i 'm meeting lotsa new people . it 's really great .

how many times have you gone unprotected ? 
well , my career takes up a lot of my time .

it is n't safe , man . do n't go splittin ' us up . not with this <number> . 
it 's my fucking life .

yeah . do i have a case ? 
now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i 'll break you in half . 
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory . <person> <person> told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man . he particularly remembers that you sat at <number> end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long . does that bring back memories of <person> o'keefe ? 
go ? there 's a potload of money here , pal . you got <number> major toy companies ... you got the guys from <person> <person> over here ... 
how are we going to find her ? there must be thousands of white vans in this state . 
i think you 're jealous that i 'm a genuine freak , and you have to wear a mask ! 
and i was standing over there rusting for the longest time . 
-- but i wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you : i , <person> <person> <person> , the eagle you attempted to cage forever . 
jonas builds assassins for a living . several of whom may be in place already . we 'd like to kill a few birds with <number> stone . 
<person> <person> <person> skid . 
somebody make a note . i want <person> ... , for the broad ... what does she like ? lilacs . <person> . a truck of lilacs when the broad comes . and get something for <person> <person> , get him , what does he like ... ?

but you 're a big star !

mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens ... jennyhaydn ... <person> ? 
why ? 
he put himself in a situation where he was gon na have to do <number> years in the penetentiary , that 's what he did . and if you know <person> , you know there ai n't no way in hell he can do no ten years . and if you know that , you know <person> 's gon na go any goddam thing beaumont can to keep from doin ' those <number> years including telling the federal government everything they want to know about my ass . now that , my friend , is a clear case of him or me . and you best believe it ai n't gon na be me . you know what i 'm sayin ' ? you gon na come in on this with me , you got ta be prepared to go all the way . i got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin ' in lockboxes in a bank in cabo san lucas . me and <person> <person> make us <number> more delivery , i 'm gon na have me over a <number> . you think i 'm gon na let this little cheese eatin ' nigga here fuck that up ? shit , you better think again . 'fore i let this deal get fucked up , i 'll shoot that nigga in the head , and ten niggas look just like em . understand what i 'm sayin ' ? 
well , she 's totally not here . 
i do n't know . 
she 's a writer -- it 's part of what she does . 
zanzibar . the comoros islands . somewhere in the indian ocean . there 's twelve-hundred islands there ... 
`` gone live ? '' 
mom- ! 
is it solid ? 
thank you again . good-night . 
this is my favorite part . even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating . he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention . every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it . 
all right , mister . i 'll go . you just show your license to contrack , an ' then you make out a order -- where an ' when an ' how much you gon na pay -- an ' you sign it an ' we 'll go . 
the drill is in the water ; approaching the intake tunnel . 
i know . 
they 're a bitch team ... score ! <person> ! 
solid , daddy . 
i got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name -- 
what do you mean ? 
you ever tell her about how it is with <person> ? 
he was a remarkable man . it was impossible not to -- 
and how many room got tv , <person> ? 
where 's your partner , the jumpy <number> ? why is n't he here ? 
i did n't even like her , to be honest . 
kinda gaudy . 
-- oh , sure . a hairdresser . how ... how do you a ... meet a hairdresser ? 
she did that before . 
so long , you guys . 
well , talk . 
our chaperon . 
there is . 
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time . they say he never arrived . 
hello . are you still mad at me ? 
so the duke dug a tunnel -- just in case . they made the lake a <number> years later . flooded the tunnel . 
it must of been a convincing letter . 
what is the scene ? where am i ? 
and we can illuminate part of it from the inside out . 
i did n't get more than a few miles before the sheriff 's car found me . the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman . i never saw the ranch again ... 
maybe we should just leave -- 
why do you say that ? 
sure looks that way . 
not this twig , friend . i got plans . 
and you ended up at uc berkely -- 
and your husband works for somebody else . 
we could get back together too . 
the way i feel , i ought not to go out there today . in fact , i 'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that 's all a part of the white man 's big maneuver , to keep us fighting amongst ourselves , against each other . i 'm not fighting anyone , that 's not what we 're here for . 
my husband ... you know him . 
she 's right . they 'll string her up . 
it 'll be fine , <person> . you 'll be fine . good luck . he stuck his hand out and <person> shook it . but there was still a question that was nagging at him ... 
no . < u > you < /u > do n't understand ! you caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates . and i 've got no time to screw around . 
do n't i know . now go home to your wife . 
he could n't stop us and that 's how he was punished . <person> , what time were you born ? 
do you have a passport ? 
i 'm talking about you . 
how 'd that happen ! what kind of trouble you in ? 
i thought it was appropiate . 
how did he get away with it for so long anyhow ? 
good luck , sir . 
ahh , complications during child birth , she died <number> days after <person> was born . 
we 're talking <person> , <person> , <person> . we know for sure they replaced <person> <person> 's `` vase with twelve sunflowers '' last week with a copy . it was on loan from the london national gallery and they 're not going to be very happy when they find out about it . 
i told her she was going to meet her father . 
you see a black leather jacket , fingertip length , like the <number> <person> wore in serpico ? you do n't , you owe me <number> seventy-nine . 
what did you say ? 
<person> ? 
no , not possible . <person> , i have to get out of here . i 'm supposed to be getting information . 
yeah . a glorified doormat . 
me too . 
yeah , dad . 
well ... uh ... 
i 've took as much of you as any man can you 've lost your heart 
they guard our , < u > you < /u > know ... `` borders , '' night and day ... 
a little bit . 
he 's got goodness , <person> . do you know what that is ? 
so i 'm part-indian ? 
please , honey , let me in . 
& quot ; in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... & quot ; 
do n't play with me , <person> , my hand is on the phaser control -- 
you got any kind of long coat in the car ? anything you can wear home over your clothes ? 
you 're right , sir . 
done . and i assume you have the magic cd- rom ? 
that 's what you 've got these children -- these slaves digging for ? 
are n't you the kid whose mother and friends were ... . 
<person> , that makes no sense . 
you always did have style . 
my daughter must be going nuts . 
they 're okay , if they got little white canes and tin cups . 
you think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin ' and hollerin ' and high hopes , but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side . <person> ? 
that 's nice , but we ca n't dodge this kind of heat for long . 
jack . 
if you 're happy with <person> taking care of him and helping you , that 's fine , but contact hospice to arrange for the body -- 
that is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination ! 
what the hell 's going on out there ? 
no . what are you gon na do ? 
how about <person> ? 
the machine works . and <person> 's gone <person> <person> on us -- 
you goin ' home ?

i got to get downstairs . the c.i.a. , they want to see your body . 
married . once . <person> woman . all these years . she just slithered up the stairs . 
i went to my room . 
elliot tells me you 're fronting for a dirty cop . 
no more smoking . we leave no scent of any kind . no hair tonics , no cologne , seal all our food in plastic bags . we will observe and document , but we will not interact . 
not good enough . 
yeah . 
i love your smell . 
the hatchery , in particular ? you know my initial yields had to be low , far less than <number> percent , that 's a thousand embryos for every single live birth . <person> engineering on that scale implies a giant operation , not the spotless little laboratory i showed you . 
the most beautiful woman in the world . 
i did n't know where she was going to lead you . 
his personal effects . he 's probably running away -- the coward . 
the girl saved my life , figured it was the least i could do , keep her out of trouble . 
... i believe they 've done lit a shuck . 
greg . 
well , thank the lord you can always depend on new england for weather . we 've got enough for the whole united states . 
we did it ! we actually sang a chord ! 
no -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money . 
<number> down . <number> to go . 
yes , but will you honor it ? 
what ? 
but right now i 'm acting in the capacity of mrs. <person> 's attorney . 
excellent work , dr. nebbleman . you have outdone yourself . 
i 'm so humiliated . i do n't know what to say . i mean -- 
that sounds fun . 
but knowin ' me and you gon na be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook . i love airports now . me 'n ' you can get on any <number> of those planes out there , and go anywhere we ant . 
hello . 
so you 're saying <person> <person> -- our <person> <person> -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched ? you 're amazing . 
<person> thomas , manager of the hotel . 
difficult ? has anything happened to <person> ? 
good evening , sir . 
ju-just stay away from her . it 's none of your business , okay ? there are certain things you do n't do , and you know that . 
what are you doing ? 
doctor , i hate to break this to you , but my mother is a little batty . 
alright . i 'll ask <person> , tell him it 's for you . i do n't think there will be a problem . 
you owe me twenty cents . come on , seven-twenty . seven-twenty . 
yes <person> ? 
what happened ? 
will you at least see how it fits ? 
jesus , <person> . 
replacement party . 
secret ... 
yo , what 's up ? 
did you kill yankees ? 
and ? she 's not saying , `` i think you 're a nice guy and i wan na get to know you better , '' she 's saying , `` i wan na bone . '' 
you should n't have to see this . why do n't you get out of here ? go for a walk . 
i thought you might be curious to find our if you 're smarter than the person i 'm looking for . 
i bet he has n't read a single report we 've written on the waste problem . 
what about ... now ? 
the lysine contingency - it 's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island , but we could use it now . dr. wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . animals ca n't manufacture the amino acid lysine . unless they 're continually supplied with lysine by us , they 'll go into a coma and die . 
i do n't see any . 
how 's california ? 
officer white ? 
well , thank you . thank you very much , but— you 've been very kind . 
what were you listening to ? 
do you think your friend 's up in heaven now , looking down on you and watching you all the time ? 
he had you down as a big-timer . what happened ? 
ellie ? what 's wrong ? 
very well . i have a friend who might be of assistance . he 's at the ministry . we 'd better be careful . 
i do n't . 
where is she ? ! 
do n't worry about coming up with anything . it 's cool . 
we can take it with us . 
how 'd you get a tux at the last minute ? 
you 're my only son ... 
then it 's war ? 
you mean a misfire ? 
you really should n't eat like that . all that sugar . it 's not good for you . 
what do we do ? 
i do n't know . you seem ... different . you make weird jokes . your accents changed . you do n't even walk the same . 
what 's the question ? 
but i did n't mean to do it ! 
oh my god ... this is his house ... _we 're in his fucking house_ ... 
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you 're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it 's just a drink , if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you do n't you can go home if you see what i mean . i wonder if it still works this way . 
oh , < u > c'mon < /u > -- even you have to admit this is weird . 
another <number> ? what word did he leave ? 
but a half <number> dollars ! my goodness , where are we going to get— 
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there . also i enjoy history . 
what 's the point of my setup ? it 's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said . 
never gon na throw a ball in the pros . 
you really are a gambler . 
yes ... yes , you have yours . 
root it out <person> ... the thought of it , before it takes hold . 
-- what-what-what , ma'am -- i -- 
nothing . nothing happend . go away .

oh yeah , he 's the real fireman . who are you ? just another probie working for <person> -- 
i did n't create this world of ours ! i only record it ! 
then something goes wrong . <person> gets killed . maybe <person> got greedy , killed <person> and left him under his girlfriend 's house . the night he died , <person> was all mysterious . said he had something big going down .

it 's still a good idea . 
what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when i gamble , i prefer to gamble on force .

i 'm not exactly ... a knight . what do you mean ? 
no , it 's not what you think , i swear ! 
<person> <person> , we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you 're very lonely , see ? and would n't she come and keep you company , because that way , you see ... 
wait as long as you like . 
i 'm not crazy . you 're the one . you 're the one who 's wrong . you 're the <number> -- 
damn them !

you went behind my back and you cut me out .

i told you i get 'scared up here , so if you 're not coming right now ... i 'm not kidding .

they 're going to hang you . why did n't you leave when you had the chance ? 
i 'd say she 's a size <number> who wears a size <number> . 
how is that possible ? you give concerts , do n't you ? i hear they are quite successful . 
perfectomundo ! we are ready ! say , would n't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? think of all the time <number> would save . 
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish <person> <person> with words . the truth ! <person> ? 
i 'm sorry . i thought i was to be the light . but why do i confuse you ? am i so strange ? 
the young girl is slashed again . 
i 'll make it a dollar . 
if waitin ' tables in a bar do n't make you an expert on human nature , then nothin ' will , and i could 've told you that <person> <person> would end up buyin ' it in a parkin ' lot . i 'm just surprised it did n't happen before now . 
no . 
where are they ? 
this tooth is from another shark . a shark that could be <number> feet long ! 
everything 's gon na freeze , the big freeze . 
'why ' would be enough for me .

lotta beautiful women . it was fun to flirt . 
then who 's buying it ? 
nice friendly approach you 've got . goble . i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning . 
a police report . 
do n't know her . 
... and we wo n't clench our fist ... 
how can they walk on these things ? how do they keep their balance ? 
i 've disturbed you . i 'm sorry - 
listen , <person> -- <person> ! where 's the ice ? 
i already have . 
i 'll have no more to do with it . i 'll not put my neck into the noose , not even for your sake , dr. macfarlane .

on the way to delhi , you will stop at pankot . 
it 's oregano . you got ripped off , pal . what are you gon na do with all this ? 
let her go ! 
hi , <person> . 
my friend -- what can <number> say --

marietta , i was just gon na leave and see if i could pick up their trail . 
an anti-psychotic ... 
i did n't put nothin ' up .

you do n't trust me ? 
senor , you need a doctor . 
i 've got a lock ! there ! 
sounds like he 's gone crazy . 
hold it down , <person> ! 
nope . 
fine . 
you took a fishing trip with the boys . liked it so much , you took another . 
so ? 
not any more . 
well , you 're to take these after you 've eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ? 
no , who ? 
that 's okay , <person> . i ca n't swim , either . 
logging ? we 'll need an environmental impact study for that ... 
open ? 
wait a second ... <person> ... <person> ... 
usual bullshit . you make <number> smart move and everybody wants to be your friend ... you know somethin ' , shootin ' guys sucks . especially compared to this . 
yes , sir . 
no ... i want to stay with you ... 
all right ... but understand , i do n't like being taken advantage of . i mean you 're in there talking with your uncle and all ... this is embarassing . 
then just say he was sixty years old . 
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion . 
seventy-five <number> . 
just give it to me ! ! 
he did n't offer you money . 
i think it 's dunn & < u > <person> < /u > street . but then , i could be wrong ... 
you 're society girls ? 
they removed all physical trace of her but they could n't erase the memory . 
yeah well , it 's been a bad day . 
well , i do n't know . i— 
sure . 
<person> ' ... and speed ! 
wait a minute ! really ? really ? i happen to teach a class at columbia called `` tv <person> and <person> '' ! so i think that my insights into <person> mcluhan- well , have a great deal of validity . 
had a lot of blood in him . 
she 's the mother . that means she 's within her legal rights . 
we had a tough year . 
is this 'spose to make me take him more serious ? 
sweetie , they 're almost ready . 
yes mac , but the guests are requesting it . it will reduce the level of negative feedback . 
i never let <number> go by me when i could catch her . 
woody ? ! 
kind of . 
then what ? 
or are you too scared ? 
what ... happened ? 
what do you mean ? 
now you know how it feels . to be locked away , to wonder if they ’ re coming for you , if anyone will ever come for you . 
you think so , baby ? does my talkin ' bother you , honey ? 
dunbar will testify that you were . 
-- uhh-huhh ... 
oh , my god . 
if he talks to me , i think he 'll leave you . do you want him to leave you ? 
i do n't dance . 
you paid $ <number> for your character ? 
definitely ! 
wait a minute -- was n't it stanley who discovered <person> ? 
juno , what 's the matter ? 
listen , you fuckin ' yokel , i 've had it with you . i 've been carryin ' your ass in this place ever since i got here . get your ass and get your things and get out of here . 
i ... do you want me to leave ? 
if you really want to `` fuck up the system '' - you should go to business school -- that 's what i 'm gon na do : get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside ! 
what did you expect , a st. <person> dog ? 
... i 've never been in a man 's apartment before . 
and <person> ? 
i ... 
we 'll try . 
hmm . 
... i feel that my government owes me a little restitution . 
can i pour you <number> ? 
he has a great body 
do you have the file with you 
i 'll give you fifty cents . 
i hope you realize , norma , that scripts do n't sell on astrologers ' charts . 
then i 'll live for both of us , <person> . i 'll be the most free , truest animal in the whole forest . for both of us . 
you have no right ! you have no fucking right , you bastards ! get the hell out of here -- 
no -- 
where do you think <person> is ? 
i feel as though i had been made a perfect chump of . 
i had to sleep fast so i took <number> allergy pills to help me ... i 'm sorry ... hey , you called me . 
is that your driver ? 
you stayed here again last night ? 
you do n't know ? what time did your mother do this ? when did she leave ? 
that 's a ptarmigan , feigning a broken wing . the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest ! 
actually , you sing . 
what is rose going to do ? where can she go ? 
... the purpose of the exercise ... is it because they are < u > expensive < /u > ... 
well -- what is it ? 
why does he call <person> ? 
where can i get a hold of you ? 
thank you . thank you . i ... i knew you would n't leave me , <person> . 
royal petition , delegates to court , judicial redress , economic boycott , bribery ... 
who at ? 
well , i got some bad news and some bad news . 
you have <number> with <number> beds ? 
what ? 
-- look , just shut up . let 's cut through the shit . you asked me here because you want me to catch and kill <person> <person> for ya ' . i 'll do it , but it wo n't be easy ... and it wo n't be cheap . <number> <number> grand , non- negotiable . 
did i give it to you ? 
you must help us . 
you 've had your breakfast -- oh , but of course you have . 
hi . you - you wan na get some breakfast ... ? maybe see a movie ... ? 
it 's ... lovely . 
what about this <number> ? 
i know . but once you get inside you 're home free . 
hi there . 
where ya goin ' ? 
what are you saying , <person> ? 
if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ? 
whoa . 
are you a good lawyer ? 
see , the jews love to separate things : the holy from the profane , milk from meat , wool from linen , the sabbath from the week , the jew from the gentile ... . as if <number> little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that . 
henryk , i said nothing bad . 
okay . i 'll copy it . 
they were . 
well gee -- how -- how 've you been , saunders ? i -- i have n't seen you in -- . i suppose -- now that you 're married -- 
that would have been quite a coincidence . 
marcus , i 'm tired . that 's all . 
i 'm following you and <person> , if you- 
what are you going to do about this allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in chile ? you gon na send <person> down there ? 
really ? that thing in the caf today was pretty severe . 
i 'll say it . 
no lightspeed ? 
may be a few minutes . i got ta stick around here ... 
i do n't expect an apology and i do n't even want <number> . i just want us to -- 
that 's a lot of ground to cover . 
that 's all we did , steal their ride . 
is someone in the room with you ? 
dangle a settlement , tie us down in negotiations , we come up short ... 
oh , come on , <person> . you know what 's going on . it 's not working out at all . i 've got to move on . i mean , i 've got needs , too . i told you about all this . 
no father . it 's nothing like that , <person> . it 's about this new thing they 're all talking about . about this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again . 
oh yes you are ! 
well , do you know where it 's set , my dear ? 
i have n't surfed since i got here . 
but what if they serve soup ? 
in our current environment , dr. weir , self-control is an asset . 
they 're so remote - cold - beautiful , the stars . but now - i wonder - 
all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . <person> ? you happy ? so now what ? 
have you seen his penis ? 
mrs. eleanor biddlecombe . she also owns <number> % of the profits . 
of course ! not only go to it but go to it in full uniform ! rent a uniform ! 
i do n't like this forest ! it 's -- it 's dark and creepy ! 
yes . <person> <person> thinks you treated him a little rough . he 's in the hospital . how about it ? 
oh , are you on the team ? 
got ta get that chain off her , <person> . <person> ' like this gets out , you could land in a heap of trouble . 
i 'll be the judge of that . 
hey ! do n't use all the hot water ! 
if we had closer relations , there would n't be any misunderstandings . that 's where a football game would help . between your outfit and mine . 
where were you ? europe , <person> ? 
you touch my spleen , <person> . and here all the time i was thinking -- if i ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well , at least there 's <person> . he 's in vd and he 's happy . 
'have ploughed the stormy seas - ' 
do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are ? 
i like cows . 
what about your knocking off for lunch ? 
... i do n't know what happened to big dave . i know some of it . irregularities in my books , they said . can i explain it . 
i do n't know ... to get <person> . 
how much you pay this joker ... this cab driver ? 
fine . i 'll need a $ <number> retainer . you can mail it . 
do you like scary movies ? 
where are you going ? bud who knows ? another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- i 'm on my own . 
we were romantic then too -- 
we have n't . i wanted to talk that over with you , too . 
i 'm not going <person> , help me with this chute . 
oh , i do n't know . i think proms are pretty dumb . 
while i was tryin ' to figure out why the guy was sayin ' what he was sayin ' , <person> just hit him . no matter how big a guy might be , <person> would take him on . you beat <person> with fists , he comes back with a bat . you beat him with a knife , he comes back with a gun . and you beat him with a gun , you better kill him , because he 'll keep comin ' back and back until <number> of you is dead . 
conditions have changed . some people have become too powerful . 
king of the housecalls ! master of the living room ! 
yes . i was . 
we got you ... it 's okay , it 's okay ... we got you now ... . 
this is , for not a fresh cup , a great cup of coffee , claudia -- 
i love you . 
my dad 's always here running the store , busy and stuff ... and i fill in once a week so he can get a night off . 
okay . 
dearest , you uncoil my wants ; desire flows within me , and when you watch me my passion dissolves it . you set me free . i reveal myself to myself and i am drenched and purged . 
this is n't happening . 
general <person> ? 
i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
i guess it is <number> forty-two . 
he leave you ? 
i 'm in no mood for dancing . 
maybe i should just move to china . <number> kid per family , that way you do n't lose your room . 
<person> zack is a good prospect -- exciting boy . 
i do n't care . 
<person> sam . <person> 'bout that . 
just ... try and go back to sleep . 
who is we ? 
sure , on me . i got <person> 's club . 
i guess no one cares what i got a job . 
now hold up just a minute . let 's be reasonable here . 
plus , even it was true , he 'd still have to figure out where i keep 'em . 
that ai n't what i heard . that ai n't what i heard at all . i heard the bat got him . 
ca n't get a little bit pregnant , <person> . 
he ? 
sam ! 
you what ? .. what are you talking about ? 
jimmy , you 've got -- 
they must 've learned how to control water ... i mean at a molecular level . they can plasticize it , polymerize it ... whatever . put it under intelligent control . 
that 's not what i mean ... 
hello ? 
our friend , poseidon , did n't use it for fishing . he raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves . 
she was twenty-one when she came to me . ... straight from leaving you . 
it 's not that big a deal . we just did n't hit it off . 
how did it go with the pantyhose ? 
who 's going ? 
i suppose it was mine . yes , it definitely was my fault . 
i think it 's time we got some professional help . 
<person> cobain . 
so what 's going on ? 
i do n't know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i 'll head to <person> <person> . i might be able to pick up some work there . 
no . i think they isolated him in genetic engineering . homo aquaticus ... 
what are you saying ? that you do n't have sex with men ? 
that 's our reserve air . 
cow ! 
yes , that 's it . <person> name , is n't it ? foreign . but sweet . 
keys . 
and you listen to that ? 
no , no , on the football field . they called me ... ... the smallville flash . 
for <person> 's sake , will you please go now ? we gave you every nickel we got . 
you 're different . 
why not ? i 'm not charging you for the time i wasted . 
i did n't do anything . 
tell me , when we searched the place , where were they ? 
gary , i -- 
you call that thing a cigar ? ? 
tell him not to eat anything . we 're gon na scarf when we get there . 
do n't be stupid ... they ... 
what responsibility ? 
yes , sir . 
if you ask me , <person> , you 're playing around with dynamite . 
we 're still drifting . 
you 're looking worried again , <person> ? 
what the fuck you mean you burned it ? 
he 's a fine boy , mrs. <person> . 
are you talking about me ? 
but that 's the point , <person> . we 're right here . 
we check out the area and wait for a time when it 's clear . 
that is perverse . do not tell anyone you do n't own fucking <person> on blonde . what about television ? 
until we 're out of the mine field is how long . 
what have you done to her ? 
when you play the midwest and south , you do n't mindfuck these people ! it 's not postmodern -- it 's rude . if you wan na perform in texas , you give 'em <person> <person> ! you give 'em <person> ! ! 
<person> . these fountain pens are so tricky . 
sir ... 
<number> years . 
the leads come in , i 'll let ... 
yeah . i just wanted to thank you for that message last night . it made me feel like ... like less of an asshole . 
at least i finally saw the reason you could n't get over <person> . 
yes , it is a mistake , because , you see , the bed , here , is my spot . 
you changed the room around ... 
<person> <person> pulled that job in <number> . it 's famous . <person> was the wheel man . did you use this same car , <person> ? 
spengler and i have charted every psychic occurrence in the tri-state area for the past <number> years . the graph we came up with definitely points to something big . 
i do n't know . 
since your father 's death , your family 's farm has been in sub-chapter s and now , suddenly , they 're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank . <person> 's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in america after all , can be a very expensive proposition <person> . so , why do n't we go quietly out of here onto the plane ... 
because you 're my sister . there 's nobody else . the men who killed <person> are after jake . i got ta talk to him . 
what 's wrong ? 
have you got it straightened out now ? 
get it out of here ! 
you told me about it . 
it 's so small . 
but ... this disease ... is progressive ... degenerative ... 
it 's not `` invisibility '' per se . you 're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field . that 's what you projected on the bridge . 
oh yes <person> <person> -- wo n't you both join me ? and how do you like our fair city ? there 's so much here do n't you think ? the museums and the books and the foreign films -- bree , have you seen the godard film ? 
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself . 
i 'm asking you a question -- 
i might . 
-- plus the forty to <person> ... how many letters is that ? 
that 's pretty freudian , <person> . 
what you have to understand , francie , is that she ... well ... she wanted so much for herself too , and for me , and she never really got to ... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers ... but she could have been ... if times were different she could have been a politician or ... i do n't know . 
it 's going to be hard to convince a jury that he 's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off . 
there is nothing to worry about now . 
no , it was a complete waste of time . 
we sometimes went downtown to score . 
guess ! 
[ it 's non-negotiable . ] 
that 's why i wanted you to come here , <person> . dr. redfield already has a background in memory loss . 
where ? 
i 'll bet . <person> , for some reason , i do n't think dogs are supposed to like me . 
so what 's the point ? 
look again for fuck sake ! 
it 's a map , i think that 's what it is . 
why ? 
there 's no ransom if you do n't have a fucking hostage . that 's what ransom is . those are the fucking rules . 
where are you going ? 
you think you can stitch me up on you own ? 
he 's your client , huh ? 
now ? 
she has n't <number> into specifics yet , she 's been waiting for you . 
cause he was a liar . and i hated him . `` get your head out of that machine , wise up to the real world . '' the more he mocked me the deeper i went . cause if being savvy meant being like him -- guess that 's why i 'm kind of clueless , even now . did n't cultivate my conniving side . 'not sure i even have <number> . 
we 'll show that to ... 
you mean my other self ... 
yeah ? 
bigger than a principal . the judge sits in robes in a big chair.. the judge has thought a lot about us , about you and me and your mom , and he has decided ... ... he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom <person> in her apartment . and i 'm very lucky . because even though you 'll live with your mom joanna i 'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month . 
and the wedding date . there 's the <number> of us . so , you think ... maybe ... you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back . 
i ... i got ta go . 
listen , i got a crazy favor to ask . 
what is it , my son ? 
i heard you were pumping gas - 
<person> . <person> <person> . but you may call me <person> . 
tell the doctor . 
<person> was protecting his wife . i 've always believed that . 
i 'm sorry , i -- i made a mistake . <person> , i 'm askin ' man to man . i wan na be ya manager . 
i remember i was trying to help ... 
hemmings ! <person> , i thought i told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night- ... 
about ... 
the empress death mask . 
thinking about what ? 
who do you think , chief ? ! 
you said you 'd cut that up with the man who did her in . 
you hear the vibrations in the wire . there 's a magnetic pulse in the wires , you feel it . i could test it . 
jesus , are you gay enough or what . 
if i do n't make it back here by ten ... 
thank you . honey . 
come on man ! 
he was ... like him . 
i am father <person> . i am a chaplain here . i thought you might like to talk to someone . 
so what am i going to do ! get <number> of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the world can get his beauty fucking sleep ! 
<person> ... i know you . 
i do n't like it . something 's wrong . 
is he all right ? why did n't you call me ? where was he ? 
oh , <person> . 
<person> connell had a signed copy of <number> of your books . 
he would n't open the lock ; he was going to leave us out there . 
i was kindly needin ' to do some tradin ' . reckon they sell toothpaste ? 
got a couple of cups of coffee at hap 's from her . that 's it . by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman ? i could ask you the same question . 
it hurts . aw , <person> ! 
well ? supper at my place ? 
loretta . what 's that smell ? 
sanford 's brother dates her cousin . he found out this morning . 
scully , i found the bomb . 
i 'd say about thirty feet , sir . 
how can this happen ? 
i want a place where only the vultures will find him ... it 'll be over soon , <person> . 
that 's right . 
do they just -- put you on the spot like that ? like , all the time ? 
he liked to laugh . 
today 's wednesday . by friday i ought to ... 
oh , he decides ? <person> 's the chief rabbi now ? ... 
why does everybody insult my intelligence , i have intelligence , intelligent people eat twinkies . 
i knew that life did n't add up to the obvious when i was <number> . 
we 're your friends . we 're not like the others . 
oh ? 
how could you do this to me ? 
i 'm a teacher . 
come up here to play straight pool with <person> <person> ? 
do n't distance us . from now on , let 's be like sisters .

yeah , where 's your machine gun . 
it 's private property . plus i have <person> . 
if the head was moving fast enough , but i do n't see how it could be . 
the room of the king 's favorite mistress ? 
yes . 
not a chance . 
hey . anyone here need lessons , just talk to me . 
what are you doing ? 
is n't that the point ? 
are these . 
they ... they killed him . i ... thought you know that . i thought you knew because ... 
you know i need to use you . 
<person> , thanks for coming over ... and how 're you doing today , <person> ? you 've got a firecracker here , the kid 's really set the table . 
what ? 
you know what i 'm going to do ? i 'm just going to take a second . i want to look at the gold . 
you okay ? 
yes . 
we must wait . <number> day the curse will pass . <number> day a dead man will ... will ... 
i meant every word of it . 
i looked at theo . she had a look on her face . 
the ... ah door 's jammed . give us a few minutes to get it fixed . 
that 's great , <person> . that 's the sort of thing i need to know . so it does n't come back to haunt our case later on . 
was going . now you are .

hey look at this !

no more favors . that 's all over , <person> . 
no , i was saying crazy like a lunatic . 
i have no luggage . 
but , will you ? 
that part in the movie where they get shot ? <person> <person> and ... i ca n't think of her name . 
no . you ca n't . look , i know you do n't know me from <person> , but you 've got to trust me . 
that does it ! back in the pack ! 
how can i do anything if i 'm being watched every second ? 
find the feet ? 
oh yeah ? what kind is that ? 
physicists , mathematicians , geologists , you name it . 
yeah . to go to school and , you know , paint , performances , paint . 
ray -- ray -- how do you feel , man ? 
you ? you think you 're the only <number> ? i 've talked to them a <number> times , but they do n't listen . 
mrs. west is a very emotional woman . 
i got ta tell ya ... 
you 're kidding . ca n't you shoot him or something ? 
would you like a drink ? 
nothing ... i do n't like being out in the open like this . 
fight it . 
my name 's <person> , i 'm <person> 's sister . oh ! you 're bleeding . 
i do n't know . 
up to here ! that 's where i 've got it - up to here ! of all the star ridden , presumptuous , hysterical- 
have you found your man ? is that where he is ? 
yes , <person> ? 
i do n't know if that 's absolutely necessary . 
so i have to watch <person> tonight . 
<person> ! are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority ? 
that ring 's so great . the green one . 
i 've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last <number> months . soak the prison off me . 
is that so ? 
be quiet . 
what shape is the scar ? 
i 'll throw that in too . 
what happened to those disks i gave you , have you still got them ? 
it 's too neat . things ai n't that neat . it makes me mad . that somebody can pay to kill somebody , his own father-in-law , and not be punished for it . do n't that piss you off ? 
just admit it , <person> . 
<person> up and get dressed . 
i have to admit , i always felt ... different . 
no , do n't be silly . what-what do we need other people for ? you know , we should-we should just turn out the lights , you know , and play hide and seek or something . 
and yet , she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine , yours , even her father 's , in a certain sense -- were n't enough for her , or did n't mean much to her . 
well , <person> <person> , i 've never told anyone what i 'm about to tell you ... but i really want this job . i like to dress in women 's clothing . 
dewey my god i thought you were dead . 
it 's not a gesture . i want to do this on my own . come on , trust me a little will you ? 
why not ? 
absolutely . and how many times has <person> called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again ? it gets under your skin if you let it . 
yes ! 
donny -- 
i was just thinking about where i 'm gon na stay . i lost the house . it 's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare . 
about a month ago . six weeks . 
you are n't sick ! we 've got to get back . what are you doing ! 
yes , <person> <person> -- it was here where it all began . 
seems not . 
dr. lecter , when there 's time i 'll - 
i already called for an ambulance . 
no , he did n't . 
thanks , guys . 
why not ? we should get some of that . just eat a big handful and see what happens . 
well , i think that 's perfectly understandable . 
i need <number> last favor . go back and get the twins . 
no , thank the lord . he 's more like his mother . 
what kind of restaurant does n't serve wine ? 
oh , jackin ' off ? 
you 're a regular sherlock holmes . now what do you want ? 
go on , little girl , take your troubles somewhere else . i do n't feel like talking to you . 
i 'll make it part of the class . we 'll tell them they 're participating in a study on sleep disorders . 
i.. 
it 'll give you the different countries , how they came to be , what they are now , how <person> came to be , the governments , the languages ... everything . 
says who ? 
now you know what to watch for ... 
<person> swayzak . 
no . 
well , yeah , it 's for the school newspaper . but it has pictures . i mean it 's a regular paper , you know . 
you havin ' any luck findin ' out who did him ? 
are you sad ? are we going to church ? for your confession ? 
okay ? 
i forgot . 

who remembers . 
... but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that . and it is certainly not cia policy . 
probably the caffeine . 
okay . so he was tall ? 
dylan ? he 's holding well . earlier he had some problems , he 's in an oxygen tent just now ... 
you okay ? 
what do you think ? 
yes sir , but these people they can not stay here . i 've heard you have a refugee center at the airport <person> ? 
it was just great . uh , i was all set ... i was set to be bored stiff . 
no thanks . i 'm afraid i would n't be able to give ozzy the focus he deserves . 
<number> <number> and twenty-five thousand and <number> months . 
yeah , but what about me and <person> ? i did n't see our names on that pardon . you said you were gon na put in a good word for us . 
about thirty minutes . those are slimmed-down tanks , so no stopping to admire the scenery . 
this town is everything a man could ask for . and if i were to end up here , i 'd consider myself lucky . but the fact is , i 'm not ready to end up anywhere . 
what do they -- ? who are all those -- ? 
like rotting meat . 
dude , dogs hate me . i do n't know why . me and k-9 's just do n't get along . 
oh my god . and they got a photo of you dressed like that ? 
for an instant ... a scout class vessel . 
<person> ' on behind my back . make me out to look like a fool to all our people . tell me , what 's friendly about that ? 
well he 's not exactly a friend . 
people can be kinder than you think . 
craig , i want you to meet my old lady , <person> . <person> , this is <person> . 
you 're talking like a madman . 
of course he thinks he can beat me , <person> . he would n't be playing me if he did n't . <person> , <person> ? 
was that you ? 
but she does n't know , about her background . she never heard of <person> <person> . 
yeah , gone into rehab . <person> . is he a suspect ? 
and do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings <person> <person> is in ? 
she ... 
i can be very persuasive . 
no car . 
well , you hear all these things lately . you know -- kids spending so much time up there ... is it holding hands ? that kind of thing ? 
no , thanks . i 'm fine . <person> . 
he 's relentless . a < u > major < /u > asshole . 
like it ? 
it 's not funny . it 's ... sophomoric and mindless ... and dumb . 
... were you going somewhere ? 
i don ’ t think so . this is going to be a better life for all of us , honey . we ’ ll put <person> and <person> in private schools ... 
please , please , that 's what we 're here for . be careful , that hurt . 
diana -- you heard from <person> lately ? 
good , then you wo n't mind cold-cocking this guy when i bring him out . 
a miss sessions calling . 
that 's enough . 
stop it ! stop it ! jackie covers her ears and looks at him , pleading with her eyes . starks ' eyes plead right back . 
i do n't think she will . she 's a slut , but i just do n't think she 's that mean . <person> 'll bring her around ... 
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . the civilian does not . 
he 's very realistic . 
who cares ? mmmm . now i remember . mayo the wop . <person> , i 'm glad you 're here . i 've been looking forward to this all week . 
how long you been out here for now , anyway ? <number> months ? 
yea , ok . i will be , i will be , i promise . 
yes , that 's right . my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together . you and i should have a lot of laughs . 
bunkers ! 
for cryin ' out loud . 
that ... that was a different matter , i ... i was tricked . 
you are cold . 
i always knew there was more . i felt it . 
so ? 
it 's not over yet . 
does he have people ? 
whoa ... she is a killer . 
he took my driver 's license , <person> , he knows where we live . 
right ? 
look a ' that -- <person> <person> <person> . 
anything ai n't a very hard number . 
i 'll come by tomorrow after work . with dinner . 
i been looking at you , and i 've decided that i want to share something with you . 
it 's coming along . at the rate he 's going , he 'll have a story finished by the end of the summer . 
i did n't know that . 
please ! please ! what are those ? 
we 'd cover more ground if we split up . 
that 's ridiculous . 
this is terrible . either there 's a monster in my kitchen or i 'm completely crazy . 
come on , dipesto . we can still have a good time . 
i ca n't see anything . how does it look ? still clear ? 
gone ! ? why would i have the kiss tick ... ? 
i 'm sorry . i just assumed . your accent maybe . where are you from ? 
i need your help . i 'm really in deep shit . 
you trust him . 
i said i hope she 's a runaway . better that than she just disappears like so many others do . sometimes they turn up years later , sometimes not . a lot of crimes go unreported , unknown . these are realities . 
why not now ? 
listen to me : <person> < u > duse < /u > was playing <person> in london in <number> , and <person> could not get a ticket . she said , `` i 'm not doing the <number> shows a week i signed for . '' she said , `` i can not bare my soul <number> times a week . i am an artist . i 'll do <number> shows a week . '' the greatest actress of her time . you know what her producer said ? 
... what 's he got against you ? 
rattling . rustling . 
why ? 
no <person> did . it was an accident . 
what 's on the call sheet ? 
hey ... you got a minute ? hey . he 's got <number> <number> in the box , am i right ? okay , you let him keep your jewels . we take the cash and the only other thing he cares about . <person> ? her majesty . we go to europe . you dye your hair , get some pl- 
oh , you do n't have to worry about that . 
<person> , <person> . not this time . 
then this will be <number> . i suppose you think i 'm too drunk to count . 
we could go to my apartment . you could see how the other half lives . 
no . 
yeah , you did . i told you not to but you did anyway . 
now since we 've had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate , i wondered if you would be so kind . 
there ya go . 
boss ! 
it 's crazy , man . instruments are crazy . we 're gon na have to eject . 
no , it 's okay . i just ca n't believe i left it out in the open like that . <person> has n't been in here , has he ? poking around ? 
no problem . 
he came to see mr kinnear . 
jack , i think i should get a job . 
hey , what did you want me to do , die ? 
but -- 
i get scared really easy , okay . 
a two-penny mauritius -- issued in <number> . not so rare as the others -- $ <number> perhaps . 
we want some grass . 
huh ? 
... he was n't listening to the right thing ... 
you said that malignant narcissism was not evil . 
your story was <person> 's baby . we were scooped ! we 've got nothing . <person> . you totally and completely screwed both of us . 
you miss the point . 
what can we do to assist you ? 
i ca n't go any farther . 
i can tell you what the nightmares are about . they 're about this ... entity . whatever you want to call it . it 's old , very old , and it 's taken different forms in different times . the only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for . 
what ? 
figures . 
what am i gon na do out there , <person> ? i ca n't go home to my mama like this . i 'll get the strap for sure . 
no . you listen to me . you busted me , <person> . you left me with nothing ! what did you expect me to do ? get a degree in counseling ? write a book about table linen ? because that 's what wives do when they get dumped , and frankly , i 'm not quite ready for that . 
oh yes ! in muncie ! 
tommy , i want you to go back upstairs ... 
what ? 
so , how 's it going today ? 
how come serial killers have <number> names , but lone gunman assassins have <number> . <person> < u > <person> < /u > booth . <person> < u > <person> < /u > chapman . <person> < u > <person> < /u > oswald . 
why not ? 
so , i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that <person> <person> , arguably the greatest martial artist of all times , developed for <number> years , that would be a fella who could defend himself . would you describe <person> that way , <person> ? 
senator 's son ? 
i want to see the tapes . 
how unhappy he 's going to be -- alone in his room . 
that 's silly . 
well he missed a great pot of stew ! 
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something . blew the entry points on <number> floors and neutralized the opposition in <number> seconds flat . <person> . 
our group is full . 
i 'm <person> . 
my days of punching deck are over . for you or anybody else . 
oh , the goddam party -- 
i do n't know what you 're into with the king pin , but whatever it is we get a piece , understand ? we get a big piece . if we find out you 're keeping us out , i may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to <person> myself . say something stupid if we got a deal , jake . 
telephone ? the gunthers across the valley . they 're mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even . 
the word from murray is : leave them alone . if we need a new signature he 'll go out himself , he 'll be the president , just come in , from out of town ... 
what do we do now ? 
it must be nice to always believe you know better . to think you 're always the smartest person in the room . 
listen to yourself . digitization . you know that officially that 's a pure fantasy -- 
neil , how are you gon na be in a play if your father wo n't let you ? 
your ego is colossal . 
he 's going to kill <person> . 
please , sit . 
i thought you were allergic to latex . 
do you mean the speech you 're writing ? 
and when you finish ? what then ? this package , whatever it is , do you give it to the cia ? do you really think they deserve it ? 
i 'm not going to walk through that shark arcade . 
< u > ear plugs < /u > . 
not if you stopped hurting people . write the truth gently . 
so who you taking to the prom ? 
i do n't know who that english guy is . some kind of -- -- courier or something . maybe a seller . maybe a buyer . but <person> < u > avery < /u > wanted him , those jigs wanted him -- and i betcha there 's a briefcase somewhere . 
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven . 
yes , wife , it is . come here , boy . your father is home . 
older , sillier . 
what the fuck was < u > that ? < <number> > 
promise me you 'll come back . 
<person> 's sick , guys . 
what happened ? 
oh you know . no doubts . no second thoughts . am i a monster ? 
does anybody know i 'm here ? 
this guy laplante won an award ? 
i ca n't . 
we must examine you . 
your usual table , sir ? 
have her bring the money here . 
really ? 
yeah . 
she takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes . 
anyway , you remember harold ? 
i do n't think so . 
it 's just a corpse . 
who ? 
could you find him ? 
blue eyes , yes , sir . 
no -- i do n't want anything . 
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he 's seen . 
the one who said he was <person> 's brother -- of course i 'm sure -- <person> wrote the word 'dyle ' before he died . he 's the murderer i tell you -- he 's the only <number> left ! you 've got to do something ! 
we could live it up and -- 
floppy , huh ? 
<person> did n't show up . what could i say ? besides , it 's double time . 
and i have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together ? an interchange of opinion ? we may find , my friend , that we are not so far from each other , not so far ! 
a witch , a witch , burn her ! 
<person> <person> tonight i 'm prepared to offer you your sum of <number> <number> <number> dollars , payable only after you provide american casefile with incontrovertible proof of -- 
they crashed it into a wall . a flight < i > simulator < /i > . 
i have n't seen <person> or <person> lately . 
you 're about an inch away from insubordination ! 
feeling lucky today , <person> . found a penny -- heads up . there was an empty cab right outside my building . we hit every green light . 
fine . hey , i 'm fine . 
it 's the truth . what 's hurt you the most is your record since the war . different cities , different jobs , and not <number> of them shows you can accept any real responsibility . 
nah . 
... that 's an awful long way to go , just to get some pussy . 
you cut to the heart of things , do n't you ? what about <person> <person> ? she going to be a hooker all her life ? 
well , maybe that 's what they teach you in new york university . in real life , it do n't work out that way . you wait till you are a mother . 
no , sir . 
that 's right -- we ca n't kill it on the ship , but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock . 
this is a nice car . 
i 'm sorry . northern england first , italy later . 
call you back . you bastard ! what do you want ? 
i tell you what . why do n't i read with her ? 
they never find that girl . 
how do you want to pay ? 
what else ? 
<person> sylvia . and <person> and <person> . and ed . and <person> . 
huh ... i do n't know . they got <person> <person> 's there . i do n't know why the fuck i 'm going there for . 
i 'll talk to him later . 
subtlety , <person> . look it up . 
oh <person> . 
tell me about it . i 've been dating longer than i 've been driving . i ca n't believe that . 
you lost all our money in a card game ? 
you must take your own life now , <person> , before it 's too late . 
a genuine woman of mystery in oasisburg . amnesia . bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up . <person> , intelligent eyes that have no business in `` <person> 's fun palace '' or anybody else 's fun palace for that matter.. 
if you resign , you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... you can fight them for years . 
you 're going to live with <person> <person> from now on , <person> ! you 're going to be rich . your ma figures - that is , er - she and i have decided that this is n't the place for you to grow up in . you 'll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to - 
seriously ? 
that 's crazy , <person> . the cops will see us . 
i have n't been there for <number> years . 
but why would she -- ? 
sheila ? yes she was . is . was . 
that guy treats women like objects , man . 
you 'll have to explain that , mrs. mulwray . 
dell , i want greater magnification . more surface detail . i want to see what this place looks like . 
i 've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to <number> thousand . 
okay . 
do n't you want to see the rest of the exhibit ? 
you think i stink , do n't you ? you think i stink for what i told you ? 
all right , all right . hey , hey . 
why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters . 
yeah , i 'm fine . just really hot upstairs . 
they 're only gon na lose . 
that 's doable . 
that 's thinking . now , he 's got the leads , he goes in business for himself . he 's ... that 's what i ... that 's thinking ! `` who ? who 's got a steady job , a couple bucks nobody 's touched , who ? '' 
is this you ? 
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of <number> men , to help a girl whose life 's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what code blue means ? 
no , wait , are you- 
now it 's worse . 
jump in , quick , c'mon ... 
you 're lying . 
i 'm sorry . but if the shoe fits . 
take my car , okay ? you come with us , <person> . 
i never thought of dr. wetzel as having a sex life outside the office . 
piss off ! 
shelly ? 
hey it 's me , what are you doing ? 
that 's right : there 's not hardly enough work these days , nothing that pays the big money , anyhow . then along comes this job , paying so much goddamned money i could n't afford not to take it . somebody 's paying through the nose for this . 
way i hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , <number> of the guys ... 
there 's a list . 
gardens . all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them . they 're like little villages . 
ask me the questions , bridgekeeper . i am not afraid . 
and commander , whatever you do ... do < <person> > not < /u > vomit in your exo-suit . it would be ... unpleasant . 
shortstop . 'course , you do n't make it to third , and you 're out . 
how often do you test , <person> ? 
it could mean that , yes . 
what ? 
we do n't know what else to do . we need results . 
hi ya doin ' there , <person> ? 
congratulations , <person> . 
i could n't . i did n't want you to worry . i thought held sort himself out . i hardly see him . he comes and goes . he 's in trouble , is n't he ? 
i 'll tell you what . when i get my engineering degree and i 'm swimming in my swimming pool , it will be very fucking okay . 
i do n't know , what ? thirty , <person> maybe . 
thank you , <person> . 
guess i got a little scattered . 
please . it must have flown here -- 
fine by me . i still want pay to <number> o'clock . 
i 'm not dressed . 
well , those things out there are n't the same , you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid . they 're from different cultures and different races . that ship just landed here -- crashed like we did . the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous . 
i 'm figurin ' how i can say it so 's you wo n't get mad . 
-- forget it . last birthday the <person> <person> <person> , the year before that : <person> . 
what are you doing ? 
getting back . 
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now . 
why are you here , why are you doing this ? coming in here -- you wan na call me a whore ? 
no i did not . i did not kill <person> <person> and then kill <person> <person> . is he accusing me ? ask him if he 's accusing me ! 
why is he after us ? 
you figger scar means to kill us ? 
must they always follow us ? 
sure . i loved it . 
is that the only way you can succeed , <person> , to see me fail ? 
who says that i 'm protecting anyone ? 
no ! 
but , this is <person> <person> . 
we cleared <number> here . 
what 's the big deal ? 
<person> so- my employer has made up his mind . he does not change it . 
and ... 
... but i still have the choice ... ? 
white bear lake ? 
yes , sir ? what shall we start with , <person> ? 
lots of things . her favorite yogurt . the ten drummers she would take to a desert island ... 
you know , his senses start tingling ... when he was approaching danger and shit . 
what is it ? 
what are you still doing here , <person> ? 
terribly sorry . i 'm always sticking this where it does n't belong . federal agents , ma'am . we 're rescuing a kidnap victim ... 
yeah , i heard rumors . 
... and ... 
bullshit ! do n't make me use this . 
you wanted me to be your son . 
no , <person> , i 'm swimming here . then i 'm going home . 
i do n't know . i 'm lost . i 'm scared . i feel like i 'm disappearing . i 'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me . 
do you want to sleep on it ? 
i guess that 's what he looked like . 
nevertheless -- 
what do you mean by that ? 
well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip . 
i know . i hardly have any time to study . 
i 've heard the arguments . like <person> 's quote , `` there 's <number> thing you ca n't do with a bayonet , and that 's - sit on it . '' 
is anything wrong ? 
buddy-boy , why did n't you say so ? you got yourself a little playmate , huh ? 
when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me . all thought i would die or be maimed for life . but i healed quickly . and like you i paid the price for being different . 
your mother was a resident of <person> <person> home before you moved her . 
let 's get the hell outta here . 
sheldrake ? 
out . if <person> does n't care enough about us to be here on his birthday , then why should i care ? i 'm going to a movie . 
how 's that , <person> ? 
i ca n't get it until monday . <person> . 
come on , <person> ... 
and your relations ? 
well , where to begin . it 's complicated ... 
i ... i 'm <person> . i 'm here to help you , d ... <person> . 
whaddaya mean they did n't reduce the bail ? if they did n't reduce it , how'dja spring me ? 
i have the silo , sir . bearing <number> <number> zero ... distance , <number> hundred meters . 
yes . 
... showers followed by sunny periods . 
no , i do n't want to hear anything . there are things between men and women that will not change ; things that have been the same for thousands of years . you are my wife , and they are my children ... and i love you and i will not let you leave , because you are mine ! 
... got to be < u > something < /u > . she gives him the sacred ... and tells him : this is the traditional harvest offering , given to the man who ties the first sheaf , the last sheaf , whatever the fuck it is ... 
are they out now ? 
why ? everybody else knows it . <person> saw to that . sometimes i think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm . 
i know a couple of truck drivers i 'd like to have you meet sometime . come on , sit down . 
what ? 
... but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase , okay ? i understand completely that it 's just a tv show . there is no ship , there is no <person> <person> , no diagital conveyor ... i mean , obviously it 's all just a- 
no it 's not . guys name their penises . 
no , wait , no wait , that 's too much , man , that 's like overkill , nobody can take that much , you 're wasting it -- ! 
do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night ? 
i 'm sorry . 
that 's over the border , general . 
and a beat-to-shit ak ? every twelve-year-old in nam 's got <number> of those . 
i have n't seen you around here before . 
oh , thankyou , your honour . the tramp takes a second look at alex . 
the woman was in shock . she was totally out on ranks . i stayed because i did n't want her to wake up alone in a place where she 'd just been under attack . stop that , you son of a bitch ! the place was n't secure . i was doing my goddamn job ! and , for the < u > second time < /u > , i slept in her living room . 
what ? 
i need the money . 
take it easy ! i did n't have anything to do with him getting killed if that 's what you mean . 
no -- <person> <person> 's car is to be brought . 
... to him . 
at your house . do n't you remember ?

all that you say comes down to the same thing . you are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife .

he 's got nothing to do with me . 
excuse me , do you know if we 've passed <person> <person> yet ? excuse me . look , i 'm asking a simple question . have we hit <person> <person> ? i fell asleep .

by accident -- 
what are you talking about ? 
what are you doing ? ! 
that 's to bad . 
i got the diamonds . 
i know she 's hungry . i tried to feed her but she would n't eat a thing . i 'm not a wet nurse .

sixty . 
what 's this ? 
okay , my hair is brittle , my skin is dry and i do n't care . i 'd weather blizzards to have you . you 're the most perfect man i 've ever known .

fair enough , i 'll take it to my place . 
well , it was n't in the jar ... 
buttholus extremus . but hey , you 're making progress . 
no , that 's your fault . it 's her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . <person> means , the most important job . 
i 'll tell you what i am - i 'm the paterfamilias ! you ca n't marry him ! 
no baseball diamonds , <person> .

well ? 
what are you ... 
wally thinks apples are boring . 
i wo n't be held responsible . 
and you defending her ? 
i accuse this man -- by his tone -- by his careful denials -- he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct -- ! *i'll* tell you why we were in tht room . because <person> <person> , a respected citizen of our state , had brought with him the evidence against this man , later presented from this floor , and *we were urging him to resign* -- ! 
what ? 
well , i always liked you , <person> . 
i 'm going with you . 
oh , you 'd be surprised . they just do n't have their doctorates , that 's all . 
<person> king , i think -- 
do you remember <number> of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window ? 
everybody has <number> like that . i thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end . 
all right , everybody ! that 's ten minutes ! 
we can shrink an army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap . that 's why we call it < combined miniature deterrent forces > . 
i 've got my dr. gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ... 
on monitor <number> . was a glimpse of something . 
guilty thoughts . see what happens when you cheat on me , even in your mind ? 
come on , man . if this shit was all over . 
i 'm sorry . 
hello ? 
pommeroy ... he may or may not be driving a black <number> ford pickup . monday . 
nah , coppers do n't do nothing , do they . 
salvatore . my young caesar . first me , <person> . then you . 
couple years . 
how are you , <person> ? 
i 'm -- i 'm with a friend . 
no ? what do you mean 'no ' ? 
awaiting my orders . 
listen , you like beer ? 
check . 
he was quoting the bible , revelations : `` behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was <person> and <person> followed with him . '' 
does it really matter what i say ? 
[ beat ] i was dropped off . 
who , <person> ? 
how can you tell that ? 
hey , do you know something ? she supports a mother and <number> kids . what do you know about that ? 
dead or alive ? 
leo , what if this play is a hit ? 
`` i am <person> 's lungs . '' it 's written in first person . `` without me , <person> could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells . '' there 's a whole series -- `` i am <person> 's prostate . '' 
sure , why ? 
yeah . i mean , you are my brother and ... well i should have found another way of expressing my disappointment . so , i 've decided to make it up to you . 
hi . <person> , darling- 
i say , my friend , do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds ? 
what does it say ? 
you tell everyone about <person> . everyone who 'll listen . `` remember <person> <person> , remember <person> <person> '' . great story . gets better every time you tell it . so you lie to yourself to be happy . nothing wrong with that - we all do . who cares if there 's a few little things you 'd rather not remember ? 
come in out of the rain , <person> . 
i just ca n't deal with all this crap between us , i 'm sorry . i 'm quitting . 
what sort of questions ? 
... cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission ... ! 
he 's arrogant and threatening . voice stress points suggest he 's worrying . 
i used to work here summers when i was a kid . 
it came yesterday . i have n't opened it yet . 
why did she have to die ? 
i-i can do the job , sir . 
yes . unfortunately it 's bullshit . the real story of <number> <number> is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors . 
i 'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends . 
and ? 
how did you know ? 
it 's more than what you 're worth . 
but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister . 
i know ... and instead of `` dessert '' it says `` mindbenders . '' 
sometimes i think it 's just for something to do . a conquest to be the last . something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away . some- thing to replace the love that can never work . 
no . 
that reminds me , if we could scrape up enough for a <number> film chain , i 've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin ' new movies on the street before they 're even in the theater . 
who ? 
but you 're the gods ! 
why should n't i make <person> my beneficiary ? i 've got nobody else to leave it to . 
i never touched her . my mother 's gr ... 
naw , i do n't believe you have . i do n't reckon i never been in here . this store did n't used to be here . 
caesar , stop acting like an asshole and think -- 
no one else knows 
so why do you stay ? 
your home address is <number> <person> <person> , coventry . 
negotiating with whom ? 
good morning , dad . 
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me ? 
i 'm not interested in personal publicity . our people know what i 'm doing . 
no , no ! i have n't heard any of this . i never got those telephone calls . i 've never been in this house ... get your things together . let 's get out of here . 
a spade , we need a spade -- i wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we 're going to dig a pit . 
what do you think <person> would say ? 
i hope the block is still standing . 
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle . i 've uncovered the details on project vulcan . it 's a new subterranean warhead delivery system . 
think you can nail <person> ? they 'll claim you were trespassing . 
it is nothing . she comes to read books , so her father will not find her . it is absolutely nothing . 
well , i admire your optimism , and i just wondered if it was regional . you ever see any movie stars ? 
i 'd better go . 
his newspapers ? 
you know you 're really very good . i take back what i said . i mean , you 're really good . 
never ? please do n't tell me never . <person> says you 've found some wonderful sources . 
who the f -- have you ever heard of a little show called <person> , <person> ? 
let 's string him up by his pull- string ! 
i want to go upstairs . it 's cold and spidery down here . i 'm hungry . 
so that 's how we stand , <person> . 
he has ? 
first you save my ass , now you want to kill me . make up your goddamn mind . 
pinned down , a mile east of here , waiting for some help from the navy guns . 
i 'm here with you . 
i 'm not telling you what happened . 
what hard part ? 
you 're damn right . but the first time you say anything about this , to anybody -- you 'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life . what 's your name ? 
now , wait a minute , dad ... 
no means yes . 
this is his assertion . 
i see . i myself can not . you use <person> skin cream , and sometimes you wear l'air du <person> , but not today . you brought your best bag , though , did n't you ? 
no ... not in the eyes of the police . 
he makes films for <person> <person> . 
be still ... 
quite a pair we make . thank you , <person> . 
lotta water . 
i 've tried to warn you . scientists are always pawns of the military -- 
she 's dead now , too . she was a nanny . 
for what ? there is no water . you understand that , do n't you ? 
did you make me a tape ? 
i have sectors 1-28 . i think <person> has the upper levels . 
hey . 
well , you know what they say , `` smile and the world smiles with you . '' heh , heh . the man should be in a straight jacket . feeling better ? 
ronnie . you ca n't see cuz you 're too close to it . these nervous spells you get . you never had that shit back in school ... 
no . no , thanks . now we 've got to do it ourselves . 
the stuff we got last night . 
how 's it going ? 
wait a minute -- <person> -- you did n't ask *smith* over here ! 
are you , are you out of work or something ? 
not exactly . 
mmmm , i love the smell of a woman . 
no one thought they 'd hold out so long . 
no , i 'm fine thanks . 
for insubordination . 
well , welcome to `` hell '' ton . 
mrs. <person> , why are you doing this to me ? why 're you pretendin ' you do n't know what 's goin ' on ? 
i remember <person> used to say sometimes , when they were handing out hard luck , the farmers got there first . 
busy tomorrow ? 
yeah , <person> ? 
look , can we discuss this later ? 
you 're not ? 
i 'm a soldier -- we 're at war . i ca n't stay home tending the damned olive groves ? 
well ... you 're walking me home . i ... i guess you 're sort of ... attracted to me and you 'll want to come upstairs for ... coffee ... 
in general . do you take risks in other areas of your life ? 
what do you want ? 
that 's what i do . 
well , that 's a funny thing to say . 
some time . 
did you see her undressed ? 
the door was unlocked . 
really ? you small town guys are good . and have you located <person> 's father ? 
that 's crazy ! 
it 's <person> <person> -- 
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot ? 
<person> christ , <person> . that 's what you spent your day doing ? 
why should i be afraid ? 
are you going to yell at me ? 
did you cry when your father died ? 
are you all right , <person> ? 
these <number> holes are yours ... 
no , <person> . it 's , it 's -- 
which is why i hoped you 'd snub him . 
that way . 
pop , will you let me in ? 
what ? 
yes , but it 's not all i feel . 
they 've gotten worse since i took away her credit cards . 
ladies and gentlemen , the perfect meatloaf ! 
my mom told me not to stay in this town . 
there might be something in there . 
did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night . 
oh , yeah , very tough . but i guess that 's good ... to keep out the quacks . 
'love ' ? oh , man , i 've got troubles of my own . 
nothing . 
i know - that 's what i said too . anyway , we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank . 
what do you mean ! ? 
what are those ? 
well , that 's interesting . wh-what kind of stuff ? 
huh ? no , not my wedding . yours . 
i do n't know . both . my plan right now is to go up on deck , look at the sunset . come with me . 
shall i leave ? 
commander , i have to log it ... 
yes . 
and suppose they take the table away ? 
so i guess you did n't get away * for the weekend after all ? * 
... what 's happening to him ? ' 
that 's not true . it was <number> . 
mother ... ... what is the phrase ... `` she is n't herself today '' ... i think that 's it . 
jack ! 
why should n't be close it ? he went away . 
it 's gon na be o.k . 
i 've got some important news to tell you , but it can wait till later if you 're not feeling ... 
maybe it 's not the army , jake . 
where 's my mother ? 
mmm . 
there 's been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what i 'm up to and all that . i 'd like to set the record straight . with your help . 
well ... yes . if it had n't been for <person> , he would n't have had to leave europe . we would have been ... european . 
<person> , i 'm serious ! 
but <person> , you said ... 
sam ! what a surprise ! 
do you ? 
is that normal ? 
oh , c'mon , <person> . this is the new york times . i do n't know ... 
<person> gower , i think . . . 
mrs. peel ... come quickly . <person> 's been betrayed ! i 'll tell you everything ... the weather 's getting worse and worse ... they 're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly ! 
i took sleeping pills . 
well , she is getting on , but she 's fine . i told her you were n't feeling well yesterday . she called to find out how you are . 
pay attention . the 600 series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . <person> , bad breath , everything . very hard to spot . i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him . 
is that you ? 
and her voice ? like lark song ? 
this is crazy -- you 're not going to eat dinner with us . 
good thing <number> of us was prepared . 
ben , i 've been crunching the numbers on the machine . i think if we can rework the power settings ... 
pumpkin ? 
vision ? i 'm a walking anachronism ! i 've upset my parents . i miss my kids . i could be trapped here forever ! and poor charlie ... i got pregnant on my <number> birthday and we had to get married . <person> 's my birthday ! i 've got to get out of here now . 
it 's too bad you do n't live down here , ted . 
are you asking me that ? 
but i should n't shut it down ? 
routine ! i do n't have a routine . and if you think that 's what this is - 
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either . 
hungry <person> <person> . 
do n't know , mon . this is a jumpship . not meant for transport . 
strange thing is , if my calculations are right it 'll be gone in approximately <number> hours anyway . the signal reduces itself every time it recycles . eventually it will disappear . are you listening ? 
teresa ? ... yeah , <person> . <person> , i 'm looking for your cousin . yeah , well today 's tuesday , payday . i have n't seen him all day ... no ... well , have you got any idea where he is ? i know it 's early yet but i 'm just getting worried that 's all ... 
i do n't get you , king . 
right . 
thomas ? who 's <person> ? 
armored trucks are very difficult to steal , <person> . 
is there anything particular you 're looking for ? 
there 's no room . 
... you 're money ... 
doc ... 
i need some security . i do n't trust you anymore . 
bernie . call me <person> . 
please ... 
in maybe <number> or <number> issues . 
... what happened ? 
it 's not what you think . 
whatever . 
no ... actually , i 'm a documentary filmmaker ? 
i have an alternate version of the first chapter . 
no ! why are you haunting me ? 
it 's <number> <number> and <number> dollars , just take it . 
yeah , but not seriously . <person> , you 're ready to walk down the aisle- i 'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody . 
goddamn , did n't you hear him ! he practically pulled the goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them -- 
what is it ? 
brilliant . 
they sort of got away . 
what if the air has gone bad ? we ca n't wear these suits forever . 
collect ? 
do n't you care ? 
if i told you once ... i told you a <number> times ... 
<person> <person> <person> . stand up . 
the troops are certainly moving in here ! 
an appetite . maybe you wo n't die after all . 
it would be honor , brock . now let 's go get this guy ... 
negative . 
what ? 
she 's not my mother , anyway . my mother 's in italy . 
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives , their struggles . here are people doing the most important job in the world , and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes . to me it can be as exciting as any chase , any gunplay . 
what is this , your farewell speech ? 
i did n't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself , <person> . 
i 'm not sure -- 
i doubt <person> ever even met <person> , <person> . <person> dealt with select customers . as for my envelope , had he know where it was he wouldn ’ t have mistaken me for a hitman called <person> when we met in los angeles . 
no . 
you tell her , <person> . come on , do her that favor . tell her there is n't going to be any picture -- there are n't any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself . 
<person> <person> <person> . he 's no dummy , that 's serious coin . 
look , lady , you saved my life once . i owe you a favor . but i ca n't understand why you follow a man like that . 
is that right ? are you going to be staying here long ? 
that he 's got a pretty face . 
no ! <person> ! i better get moving here , <person> <person> -- everybody else calls you just plain `` saunders . '' why ca n't i ? 
fear will keep you alive . any <number> who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish , and bound to die . 
oh , will ! i 'm sorry . 
beats me . 
looks like we got a couple of live ones . how long these boys in for ? 
our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not , shall we say , satisfactory , yes ? 
what do you mean ? 
i ... they 're all dead , <person> . they 're all dead . i thought ... some of them ... you know ... 
week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger . we ca n't feed all the hungry . 
remember the finals in akron in '59 ? you had a seven-ten split in the final frame . 
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak . my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins . there 's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away . 
i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz . he gets into his car . 
i 'm going to be number thirty-two , like <person> . 
what does <person> say ? 
he was n't there . 
put that down , i 'll ... i 'll call the police ! 
-- and damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued ? 
i must admit , <person> <person> , i had moments i was worried . 
what ? 
rave parties ? ! that 's so typical - you would think it was called rage . <person> ! 
yes , sir . 
mom -- ? 
no difference . 
hardly anybody does , that 's the beauty part . no cameras , the doj does n't bother with it , it 's accessed by a tunnel they boast about . you know the best place to hide a leaf ? 
naaaa . <person> thing has a little dick . 
... say , the hula hoop such a success . 
maybe we should send up <number> flies -- and see if they 'll propagate in orbit . 
... so your dad lives in pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth . 
but do n't you dare say that . 
maybe i can change him . 
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much ? 
plus the same deal as before . 
you got a nice crib here . 
for what ? 
the planet has been totally blown away ! it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i 've ever seen ... if the empire had a new weapon that could do this ... i would have heard something ... i 'd know about it . 
this is chaz speaking . <person> , but we are not home . our present location seems to be only halfway to irth . <person> at your posts and stand by . that is all . 
i see , all right -- it 's time for us to get out of this field . 
we might be able to go that way . 
this letter . i 've never opened it . 
yeah , if you 're <person> . 
yeah , <number> of my favorites . 
she 's driving me fuckin ' crazy . 
lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ? 
out . i do n't know where . i was waiting up for my husband . 
well . i 'd love to see that , but after taking counsel with my captains , i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city , then wait till <person> arrives with reinforcements before doing anything . 
<person> god forbid you to tell the truth ? 
how do you mean ? 
by all means , knock yourself out . 
in the press , perhaps . but she 's sold more copies of her highland journal in <number> months than <person> will ever sell in a year . time to wheel her out . 
well , i 'll call him when he does . 
i did n't see nothin ' ... 
quintus is overly idealistic . 
like to get this position . did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person ? 
we 'll see you soon , honey . bye . 
i 'm fine . she 's back on . <person> ? i 'm here . 
why ? 
i do n't see anything . 
you just left me without a phone call , a letter , nothing . all this time . yeah , i guess i 'm still a little mad . 
microscopic - - never repeat , and vastly affect the outcome . that 's what ? 
what 's the idea ? 
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with < u > no < /u > spare battery , hmmn ? 
oh come on , do n't feel bad . you got played , so what ? you 're new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business <number> day and have all the angles figured out ? 
what does that have to do with you ? 
you disdain accepted wisdom ? 
carla and i will guide you , help develop and evolve your work ... maybe lead you toward something more abstract ... 
mr . <person> . 
no . <person> . except i was born in cody . how did you know that ? oh , right , sure , i forgot : you know everything . 
yeah . 
are you kidding ? i 'll be down in a `` i-crapped-my-pants . '' 
you 're out of touch . <person> blew him up . 
fix my glasses . 
well , listen , uh ... good luck with the joint , huh ? 
no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up , she forgets and puts it down . 
i came to tell you what a swell guy i think you are to do this -- 
it was the fugitive in the chrysler that caused this . we were trying to overtake him . 
watch it , brody . you 're ruining the shot . 
but how do you know for sure , you have to try to find a way to fig -- 
believe me , if i could prove it , he would be under arrest . 
two-thirty . that gives me time to see my boy . 
'that right ? good for you . 
what the hell is that ? 
w-y-k no 'c . ' i 'll be down in a minute . 
i 'm sure . and kate , thank you for coming . thank you for being such a good friend . 
listen , when your band was playing at roseland - 

what do you want ? why are you here ? 
and i 'm sorry that i did that . 
i 'm afraid of being lonely . 
you 're actually gon na bail <person> out . 
except when he does n't say things they 're usually nasty . 
well , got to get a plane to savannah . great running into you , <person> . give my best to your daddy . 
i ride with fat-boy ... 
think we can fit up in there ? 
suit yourself . 
stop doing that . we can all relax , it 's almost over- 
did she ever see <person> ? 
she just had a baby that 's all . 
how about ding dong ? 
to hide it from the i.r.s . 
can anyone else see him ? 
the way they talk to each other . you can tell they 're buddies . 
<person> wessex . you have been waiting . 
<person> oh . 
i 'm aware of that . 
like what ? 
some other guy ? 
i like you . i do n't know what it is exactly . 
because your a virgin ? 
no . 
i thought this was an informal meeting . what 's he doing here ? 
i saw it before it got them . i tried to yell , but ... he asked me to look out for him . and i did n't do it . i let him die . 
yeah ? 
this food 's delicious . you 're a wonderful cook . and you have a lovely home . 
i remember . the big tipper . 
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ? 
about things . about your wife . 
not for long . not when they do a fingerprint check . 
you 're the shrink , are n't you ? 
what makes you think i would do that ? 
then help me to understand . i want to understand . 
it 's the truth ... i need you . i know you 're innocent . 
they 're coming right in . 
<number> . you had <number> leads . <number> kicked out , <number> the judge , you say ... 
please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know , do n't hesitate to ask us . 
do n't worry about that . we 'll settle after the hand . out in montana where i come from a man 's word is all that 's necessary . what have you got ? 
yeah ? when was the last time ? 
so on active duty , <person> did n't make an arrest from <number> to '43 . 
harry ? are you okay ? 
i 'm guessing no . 
hey , no strings , right ? that 's what you always said . just good pals who have the hots for each other . 
what do you think ? 
i did n't tell you to do it ! you ca n't just do unauthorized work . 
thank you for that scientific analysis , <person> <person> . 
at the risk of sounding stuffy , <person> -- i 'll remind you of the constitution , and the phrase `` search warrant '' issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim . he must ask for evidence . 
the world is just <number> kiss-ass game after another . a man has to make up his own life , alone . 
why ? it 's such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again . 
-- and here i am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake -- 
yeah . `` itchy '' sent us . 
nineteen ! 
can you make out what they 're talking about ? 
you promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains ? 
i pray you : be succinct . 
what do i want a way outta here for ? i want to live here the rest of my life . i want to be your next door neighbor . i want to take out kids to little league together up <person> <person> . 
no . i tried to stop it . i could n't . 
i can take care of myself . do n't worry . 
oak ? 
that ribbon is n't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space . it 's a doorway . it leads to another place- the nexus . it does n't exist in our universe and it does n't play by the same rules either . 
i 'm marrying <person> . 
i do n't talk that way . 
because , you know , you seem so distant . and you work late every night . and we hardly ever have sex , and when we do , it 's ... i do n't know . it feels different . 
donna 's gon na be angry about her cat . 
anything -- - 
they 're ... they 're trying to make us move ! 
but did n't you avoid contact with ms. torres , after you found out she had aids ? she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her , is that correct ? 
i do n't know ... 
skylar . and by the way . that guy over there is a real dick and i just wanted you to know he did n't come with us . 
small town on the eastern side no one 's ever heard of called <person> . 
can you set up ? 
negative . negative . 
and you think you 're the <number> to apply some heat ? 
it 's the only frontier i have left , plumcake . 
as a matter of fact , you came home without any clothes . you were in your - uh - shorts . yes , sir . 
i see . i 'm sorry about this , <person> . i 'm not happy about this situation . it 's bad . you now know who your brutus is . 
this is easy -- i 'm not hurrying . 
must you use that awful word ? 
oh , <person> ! you 're kiddin ' ! 
do n't rub it in . i live here . 
<person> named <person> <person> . used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97 . 
if there is <number> thing i ca n't stand about sleeping with women , it 's all the fucking mind reading . 
we do n't know that for sure . we 'll have to wait until they move . 
burt and <person> 's place is closer . let 's do their kitchen today . do nestor tomorrow . 
appreciate the loan . i 'm good for it . 
what happened to you guys ? 
now about our coming up in the world a little . you 're not naive . you 're a man of the world . the movement 's grown ; we 've grown with it . you know folks . they want their leaders to be prosperous . <number> hand washes the other . 
oh , <person> <person> , my name is dr. ... 
drop that attitude . here 's some- thing really worth while . 
here , <person> . drink this . you know , you 're awful . you probably were flirting . 
ames here . < u > <person> < /u > ... 
well , we are <number> miracle short tonight . so , just guard the stairs ? 
what are we talking about ? 
no , <person> . i do n't hate him . unhook my blouse . 
<person> sobchak . 
like what ? 
-- cliff-hangers -- 
all right , then . i 'll tell them . 
what is it ? 
hell , i , i 'm not proud of it . but , uh , that 's not the worst of it . i got a note . a blackmail note . you know , come across or everybody knows . 
daddy ? 
he wants ... your `` sister '' ... 
how should i be ... arrogant ? 
so where 'd you say you was ? 
my letter ... 
now < i > you 're < /i > here . who are your `` friends '' ? 
reach out farther . call to her . 
piss off , <person> . so how you gon na find him , <person> ? 
no . as a matter of fact i have n't the slightest idea what you 're talking about . 
we 'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see ? 
no , it is not something i 've heard about you ! it is someth -- why ? is there something i should have heard about you ? 
well , if we 're , like , the man invisible , what are you ? 
i see . 
it 's pink . 
well , sometimes ... ah-hah , i knew it ! <person> <person> . 
i 'm not going home . i 'm going to wisconsin . 
activated . 
<person> viola is pious , my lord . 
it 's not -- what 's a <number> ? 
b : <person> is dead . he 's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade , whose name i know you do n't want me to mention . there 's nothing to find . the biggest piece is the size of a pea . we wander around , looking for him until the germans pick us off , <number> after another . 
call me a cocksucker and you 're outta here ! 
you said <number> o'clock . 
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people , my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe ... . ... ... ha ha ho ho and hee hee . 
what did you think ? 
get that camel out of the way ! 
really , now is not the time to make waves . 
ford , you were right ! 
it 's not my line . 
i 'd really rather take care of it myself . 
do n't , i 'll drink it . 
jack , she 's innocent ! 
not if they 're starting a war . 
yes , i am . i 'm an archer who can read and write . who do you want to write to ? 
do n't tell me , partner . i 'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang . 
his law firm , same <number> that hired me . israel walked out after he made bail and nobody 's seen him since . 
yeah . i tell you , they 're <number> big happy family over there . 
you seem to have had a reason for every other question . 
well , it might be <person> . they 're threatening not to come ... 
mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year ? <person> ... 
<person> , it 's <person> . <person> , we 've got a nibble on the pendleton financing . 
well , i would n't call it an elegant profession . it 's in a lower social scale . people look down on butchers . 
how do you know so much about this junk , <person> ? 
i 'm glad to hear that , <person> , i really am . but you have to know -- when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine , they 're not going to say , `` ooh , good , <person> <person> can finally write what we 've always wanted : an esoteric , semi- autobiographical character study . 
she says she wo n't be intimidated by parasites . she called the duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer . 
i fooled them into thinking i was alone . 
black ... 
y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the wall of fame ? 
i used to see her every day , and she never knew what was going to happen to her , and neither did i ! i mean i know how stupid that sounds , but ... 
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions . 
jesus , <person> , you should 've told someone . 
that 's <person> <person> ? he 's <number> feet tall . i 'll go over with you right now , shake him down . 
that 's what everybody believes ? 
the killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder , sidney . recently he 's also left a photo of your mother . 
... general store . 
where the hell is <person> <person> ? 
do n't do this . 
and you ? 
<person> alito , please . 
will you keep feeding me ? how long can you live like that ? until it kills you ? until i kill you ? without your blood i 'll go back . 
no . i do n't think they all did what i did . 
you 're right , do n't matter where they come from . 
i think it 's about that time , <person> . the charges against you have been dropped , the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well . 
i do n't want old sad bastard music either . i just want something i can ignore . 
ca n't nobody read minds long distance . all he have to do is ask somebody . 
smells good . when do we eat ? 
why 'd you help me in the first place ? 
well , i 've been watching you . i 've watched you eat , i 've watched you speak , i 've watched the way you move , and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at . i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time . and you know what ? 
you understand ? 
what you saw tonight , we 're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . we 're talking about stuff where people get hurt . specialty product . 
there 's nothing there , you brain- dead cunt . think about it . there 's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything . i want you to hang the phone up , and if you call me about this again i 'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader . 
no , uh , my name is <person> <person> . i have an interview with <person> <person> . 
—and if it 's all the same to you , i 'm moving out . 
see this ? 
see , it could n't have been me . i was in jail , remember ? 
yeah , to play with his dolls . 
what ? 
i did n't -- 
very pretty . <person> pretty , indeed , <person> <person> . but would you mind telling me who goes on <person> <person> ? 
oh <person> , do n't forget the wedding present -- it 's behind the door in the laundry room . i got her a pasta maker from the catalogue ... not that they 'll know what to do with it in branton , <person> ... probably use it as a planter . 
missing what ? he did n't say shit . 
<person> sister , you 've been talkin ' 'bout me the last eighteen years . what have i ever done to you ? 
i hardly know him . i saw him only once , some years ago . i ca n't even remember him . 
what would you say to a short <number> ? bourbon still your drink ? 
i do n't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property . 
hello ? 
he 's dead . an accident . hit by a bus . 
what happened to his tooth ? 
it was n't what i wanted . 
the scar . <person> of you has it ? 
if i leave , you will be right back where i found you ... 
why is everybody up at sunrise ? 
you stop right there . you are a good person . good things happen to good people . 
i was a cameraman for nightline for <number> years , been freelance since '91 . do a lot of work for greenpeace . 
he was slow . very simple . they wo n't all be that easy . 
i hate waiting . i could give you my word as a spaniard . 
i was right ! <person> on it ! 
me and wes are just going to talk . 
very funny . you can let go now ... . i 'm getting angry . 
do n't get any ideas . she 's my girl . 
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine . <person> handsome , animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you . 
let me tell you something , okay ? when you 're brought up , like the rest of us , in a place like where i was brought up , there 's not a whole lot of discussion about ... homosexuals . as a kid , you 're taught right away that queers are weird , queers are funny , they 're a danger to kids , they 're afraid to fight , and they all want to cop your joint . and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there , if you want to know the truth . 
i 'm not really asking you , i 'm telling you . 
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures . 
you know , there 's <number> thing you did n't tell me about guys . 
it does n't matter . the publicity 's the main thing . 
where ? 
do n't you have a girlfriend ? 
perhaps you could convince her ? 
lint ? 
kabula 's out . 
the commission do n't decide how i spend my honeymoon . 
what 's it look like i 'm doing ? i 'm tuning a goddamn piano . 
what is it , <person> ? because i have to get home . i 've got a parole officer waiting for me . 
i 'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch . you are -- ? 
that 's right . she will get fired . in fact , i want you to send her back to paris . 
i have n't seen him in <number> years . 
oh , my god , are they vegetarians ? that 's not in here ... 
it 's a whatzis ? 
no . 
i 'm supposed to fall for that ? 
the money is unimportant . 
mmm . 
you took this gut out , too , did n't you ? 
<person> shit <person> ! what was that ? ! 
oh , doctor ! 
call me <person> . 
cleaning up a mess . 
what 's a chinese heaven ? 
i am , <person> . 
are you okay ? i wish i had n't told you what i did . but i ca n't help the way i feel . you do n't hold that against me , do you ? 
you do n't have to do this . we could just cut out of here , go to akron , or anywhere else . 
i 'm only telling you what i 've heard ... have n't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was like ... ? 
how did i get here last night ? 
it 'll be okay . i do n't think you should wait out here though . i think you should go home . can you drive this car ? 
this honey does n't handle so good in town ... 
i leave extras , miss . 
what can you tell me , young man , about the various flavors of `` frozen yogurt '' ? 
and i only deal with you ? 
come on , do n't you screw with her , please ! you ... you got to want this : armored car job . caltrust bank . they took <number> <number> in cash ... 
no problem . 
well . 
go right over there . 
i love writing . a-anne rice ? i love <person> <person> . 
do you know of the water of life ? ... the truthsayer drug ? 
<number> years , ma ... 
hesitates . then drops his sulfa . fumbles in his pack . finds the morphine . 
who is she ? where she come from ? 
taller , <person> . 
<person> got out on a private boat . he 's in a hospital in miami . had a stroke but he 's recovered okay . <person> 's dead . 
oh , no , no . we do n't use money in heaven . 
not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we 're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices . 
you 're dead ! 
and our troops here ? 
there 's no plug to pull . 
you sure ? 
like i 'm responsible for all the smokers ! 
i 'd be really ungrateful , if i did n't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when i did n't know where to turn . 
no , actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you would n't have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead , because they 're both schools , right , and we 're all in this together , and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details , yeah ? people get all hung up on details , but what 's the point ? like which school ? does it matter ? why ? when ? where ? or how many o grades did i get ? could be <number> , could be <number> , but that 's not important . what 's important is that i am , right ? that i am . 
frederick , just what is it that you are saying ? 
that 's right on time . this is my friend , <person> . his pops is <person> . 
it 's different every time . 
yeah , he got her busted for possession ... 
i understand that , sir . 
well , they must be something sexual , because <person> gets freaked out by that shit . are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something ? 
<person> does you favors , kid . you got to do a little <number> for him once in a while . 
what a pleasure , governor reynolds . i 'd like you to meet some of our staff here . . 
no ... in the brains ... what little i 'm sure he has . 
he must mean after `` slime creature <number> '' . 
that 's too far ahead to plan . 
i did n't . until i was dispatched to clean up <number> of the flight <number> survivors . 
loan shark -- hey ? 
forget it . you 're in no shape to climb alone . i stayed with you this far , and you did n't drop me , so i owe you . c'mon , let 's go . <person> up , time is money . 
the plastic surgeon ! i read about you in la style . 
i do n't think <person> <person> is going to sue anybody . 
until it happens , you 're still a human being . 
wan na go ? 
you refused to comply with a direct order . 
`` ... it 's all there in the <number> notebooks . read them in order . if you do n't want to , i suppose that 's okay too . but in that case i want you to know something -- i never stopped loving your father . he was a very good man . it 's just that my love for <person> was different . he brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before , or since . he made me feel like a woman in a way few women , maybe more , ever experience ... '' 
oh , my , yes . 
for once , <person> , drop it . 
what about the progressives with the high jackpots ? where are they ? these machines are hidden . 
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school , be- gins making noises like a pacifist . a real egghead , do-gooder , and crackpot ! 'ban the atom tests ! junk the nuclear subs ! spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace ! ' 
shut up ! both of you shut the hell up ! 
but that means that most of the valley 's been sold in the last few months . 
what are you doing in there ? 
fail safe in lock . <number> minutes to drop , <number> minutes to detonation . this is sergeant pinback calling <person> # <number> . do you read me , bomb ? 
<number> o'clock . <person> is bringing his son . very bright kid , watch yourself with him . who 's this girl you 're taking ? 
oh , to hell with the diet , a number <number> , please . 
you 've had plenty eva , <person> , it 's <person> 's turn . <person> on station . if anything happens ... 
you were never my guest ? ! 
addison ... 
i presume you shall . this wo n't be my last visit here . 
i was talking about my rug . 
she sure sings nice . 
hey ! mr. big shot . 
you were n't . thanks . how does it feel being here ? 
he likes you . <person> and i have always had similar tastes ... 
but i am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends . 
on mondays and wednesdays , i work for the travelers ' aid . at the airport . 
<person> .. i do n't know what you 're ... 
you know what happened . 
what ? what do you mean ? 
i regret we have no servants to show you out , <person> <person> . respect my wish and go . 
shut up , <person> ! 
and started to run . 
shall i answer it ? 
are you always so bold ? 
to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes . 
<person> ? forgive me but are you -- drunk ? 
not a discrepancy , an error . my capacity is <number> tons , not <number> . 
christ ! 
ca n't we just dump him fast someplace ? 
just better . 
anything else bothering you ? 
you said it was n't a tragedy . 
so what 's the biggest ? <person> ? 
i know you -- 
<person> , are you okay ? 
who is that girl , anyway ? 
yeah that 's it . 
gee , i used every frame of film we shot . maybe they wo n't notice . 
ah ... er ... it looks as if you 're taking me . 
<person> -- what 's wrong ? ! 
<number> days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ? 
i mean if he was dead , i could handle that . 
now what ? 
get the bang sticks . we 're going down . 
he must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his . it 's like a bed on wheels . it must smell of semen ... 
you 're pushing this too hard . it 's like you < u > want < /u > me to say < u > stop < /u > ? you must know that 's the way this is going , <person> ? there 's other work to do , why do n't ya ease off a little ? 
no . <person> , you do n't understand ... 
yes . i loved my husband , <person> . 
he would have liked that . 
do you like talk like that ? 
it 's a lie ! 
i still ca n't believe you missed the fucking team bus . 
the phone . what did you hear on the phone . tell me . word for word . 
like to raise the stakes , <person> <person> ? 
this should be amusing . 
you must be juliet . 
a word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss ? probably not the best time to hit on them . 
there must be something i can do , something i can say to make this up to you ? ... just tell me what it is , i 'll say it . i 'll do it . i do n't want you to hate me . 
i want to see a friend of mine ... a very dear friend ... . it 's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies ... . it 's a girl . 
i 'm not looking for a friend . i 'm looking for a jedi master . 
you getting into bed to think about yellow ? 
so it do n't exist . 
what was <person> doing outside ? 
get some sugar too , for the coffee . 
i went all over but i never found a place like this . look at that sunset , <person> . it 's perfect . 
i 've lost my taste for knickknacks -- 
no . i do n't think so . 
hey . 
bon soir , mademoiselle ! 
<number> of those sightseers -- you know . you see , i -- gosh , i 've never been called absent-minded or ... but there it was all of a sudden -- looking right at me through <number> of the station doors -- 
maybe he does n't see it that way . maybe he 's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now . that 's what you 're hiding away from , is n't it ? 
really ? 
what 's your problem ? 
wait a minute . i thought you 've always been afraid it would overload your neural net . 
okay , tell you what : i 'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan . 
right now ? 
oh yes we have ... are you alone , <person> <person> ? 
do n't drink up all of yours , 'cause you are n't getting any of ours . 
you should watch that ! 
why would anyone do this ? 
time travel . i always thought it was <number> of those myths ... like <person> 's reindeer . 
oh , no , no , no . do n't let it worry you . not at all . it 's probably for the best . 
we ? you and your parents killed your husband ? 
let 's do it ! it 's <person> , <person> , only for you . 
i like you in a black tie . 
she did n't call anyone ? even locally ? 
spock ? concerned about his chances ? 
do n't worry baby , it should n't take you more than <number> days if you just stop to sleep and eat . 
yeah , but that does n't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down . 
i could n't save them . 
you really ... did n't have anything to do with what <person> was doing , did you ? 
gabe ! hey , man ! gabe ! it 's <person> ! 
i do n't want ya cleanin ' nobody else 's cages no more . 
how many what ? 
aw , do n't tell me you 're growin ' scruples . 
... this is nothing . this is nothing . d'you ever shoot in < u > <person> < /u > ? <person> <number> italian starlets on benzedrine , this is a walk in the park ... 
do n't be silly , anyone can dance . here , just follow me ... watch my feet . 
see ya and raise <number> . 
i 'll sleep around a little . 
what ? 
c'mon , <person> , everyone hates the army during <person> . i 'll tell you straight , i hated it here . 
what shall we do ? 
congress cuts , military bleeds . but <person> 's a big place . let 's narrow the sights . 
then , please , which is correct ? you 've sworn today the patient ate <number> hour ago . <number> years ago you swore she ate <number> hours ago ? <person> is the lie . when were you lying ? 
no . no , it 's not ... 
i scared <person> into silence . he 's been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me ... i did n't know if i could trust him with that kind of secret -- 
i just made it up . it means , `` get me out of there . '' what the hell 's that ? 
i wan na be wrong here . but we need to go to the precinct and talk about it . 
i did n't . i got a job , too . i wonder if that hurt her , my not letting her sacrifice for me ? some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you do n't let them . 
you alright ? 
<person> ? 
tell me , why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like <person> and find yourself famous . 
no . no ! morpheus ! do n't !

my goodness gracious ! this place is something ! 
we 're only <number> payment behind . i argued with her . it is n't right . 
how about the record room for any incident reports ? he might be a victim . we can get medical records . check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him , knows his habits . 
do n't bore me with that bullshit . 
no more brothers , <person> . 
no time for argument . 
mmm , what ? 
everything okay ? 
it 's me . <person> <person> . 
i know you 're not .

i did n't see nothin ' . 
that 's all right , <person> . do n't worry . 
all right , no more picking on dim , brother . that 's part of the new way .

you 're sure right . it is a strange world . 
she 's had a lot to deal with ... she needs time ... . 
what does that mean ? 
i 'm promised to another ! 
what about <person> , <person> <person> ? 
i have here a discovery that will startle the world . it 's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a megatherium , [ <number> ] found in asia . 
but the composition as a whole -- i 've tried to keep a sketchy freedom . 
i 'm going for 'em ! 
because i 'm sure you 're dying to beat me . 
why worry about me ? you 're the one who says only look out for yourself . 
no way ! <person> 's great . can we stay out all night ? 
you 're sure of that ? 
... but i 'm starting to think i was ... i was going to ... 
i do n't think i 'm quite familiar with that phrase . 
i had hoped you would come to me last night . 
you serve martinis , doncha ? 
i was just thinking about my mom . she would n't leave him . i remember <number> time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . i mean it was dark outside and in . but we never talked about it . 
listen to me -- i ca n't do anything about what you 're going to do . i ca n't change anything . i ca n't stop you . i just want some information ... 
pretty sure or sure sure ? 
well , i was thinking , maybe an enemy attack is not in progress ? 
i 'll match any man with the sword . 
that 's right . 
aim just in front of his face . 
you still think this is about me , do n't you ? 
tell me ! 
how much does this cost ? 
people done it . if they could , we could . 
evelyn . great ass . goes out with that loser <person> <person> . what a dork . 
<person> , pal . entrance is for residents and guests only ...

why do n't you just call him ? 
officer all sleep now , yes ? and i go wash clothes . 
we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town . 
you think i 'm making a mistake marrying <person> ? 
they always pick <person> up early on thursday .

try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around . 
ah ... i did n't know you were having guests ... 
no longer . 
just about anything i want , it looks like . this is gon na be tough , though . there 's no way to save this game . i got ta get it right the first time through . 
who 's that ? 
the prince of darkness . 
yes . but maybe this proves that <person> found out about the money . 
anya , wait ! 
what ? 
maybe it 's for old-time 's sake . 
where 's <person> ? 
-- i 'll tell you why . it is because <person> <person> <person> , supermodel with a sag card <person> 's gift to cinema , has it written into her contract that all cherry <person> & <person> 's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have <number> packs of cigarettes waiting for her <number> of them opened , that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room , and that any time she travels , her nanny must fly with her first class . 
going without food is bad business , son . why did n't you ask somebody ? 
no…not really . 
issues ? ? ? this guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue i 've ever heard of . 
jack , i got no gloves . 
those assholes are supposed to be < u > fixing < /u > the goddamn road ! hey ! where are you guys ? people got ta use this road , you know ! you on a booze break or what ? ! 
do you want me to stick around ? 
pretty good ? say , i was just about ready for the major leagues when i chipped a bone in my elbow . i got it pitchin ' a nineteen-inning game ! 
what do you think happened on this boat ? 
someone else was there . 
years ago , in la , i turned a trick on sunset and western . the guy was polite and did n't argue about the price . he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with . a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room . there were <number> or <number> small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room . the room had a bed and a dresser . he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him . about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up . i felt kind of guilty because he had n't come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes , but he said it was all right and began dressing . when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and ... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek . he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car . i remember being relieved that i would n't have to work again that evening . 
i ca n't . you 're drunk . 
oh , let 's assume that they have . 
was he bruised up this mornin ' ? about the face ? 
because i know you 're full of shit . 
we do . 
that must be the tenth alienist they 've had on <person> . even if he was n't crazy before , he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him . gim me the desk . 
a detective 's nightmare . 
dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level . where is everyone ? 
i do n't want to see the dress . 
no , we checked his story with a tipster . he was cleaned by <number> grifters on <number> . 
thank you , <person> . 
so , you study world events , little <number> . that 's good for a girl your age . 
i 'd like to begin . 
me and you are gon na have a talk .

hey , that 's great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you do n't mind if we go through the routine ? it gives us somethin ' to do . 
hey , man , i 'm down too , you know . 
objection ! your honor , counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings . 
what do you really think ?

coupla more rings ... <number> . 
let 's go back , <person> ... 
welcome to the monkey house has been a seminal influence on me -- hey benjamin -- give it a try ? this stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions .

far as i know . 
i was hoping you 'd be a little late , <person> <person> . you see , he has n't arrived yet . 
i think i pulled my quadriceps . 
what if he is ? 
go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they wo n't understand you anyway .

forty-two was a lean year around here . the war had just started ... you were gone less than a month ... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall . not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket , and a chicken 's as good as money if you ask me . at that time , it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures .

and have you any other truths to tell me ?

vivian -- 
thanks . 
it 's always the little things . 
if you want to , you can call your lawyer . 
and the other performer ... it has to be that monster you use ... the man in the mask .

he did ? 
this is very good for us . 
i 'm in heaven , lt . 
my , those little ears pick up a lot . the cult of good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist . since we will be the ones performing the heist , our deaths will obviously be fake . but have no fear . there will be many other deaths tomorrow ... and those will be quite real . i 'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs . 
that 's good . 
thank you . 
get me a plane ... 
and the new label ? and the kinky wizards ? 
we 're all going to have to go out for breakfast . the cook quit yesterday .

i 'm so sorry . no one would switch flights with me . 
gee , with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse . 
i mean , this is <number> special gift ! who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this <number> ! 
i think your passion is terrific . 
do not reach through the bars , do not touch the bars . you pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils . no staples or paperclips in his paper . use the sliding food carrier , no exceptions . do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you . do you understand me ? 
he 's out by the pool right now . 
... it 's <number> of , you 'd best get on in there . 
a fuckin ' pink robe and a fuckin ' ... 
i did n't do it , <person> . 
here 's the knife to do it with . only make sure you got the right throat .

want me to call for you ? i called for <person> last year . 
he was by the book , all the way . 
margaret . 
oh ? 
... and gorgonzolla cheese . 
i thought we decided that <person> was way too cool to be interested in sex , and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that ... 
did you try going through c-gate ? 
-- <number> 
we want to see mrs. karras . 
you think your investigation 's been all that secret ? you know , when you talk to people , they talk to other people . 
red rum . 
how are you , <person> ? 
you 've made a wonderful impression . your views are liberal ... it is easy to see you have an open mind . 
i 'm sorry , <person> , but i 'm struggling here . i do n't understand any part of this conversation . you 're asking me what i would think if you told me that you had n't seen a film that you 've seen . what am i supposed to say ? 
well ... 
you were looking for us ? 
i did n't make up the name . it 's the steely dan song . and it was in the commitments . 
how 's it feel ? 
my dear niece -- i must ask you not to interfere . war is not a woman 's problem . 
right . 
how long can he stay down ? without breathing ? 
mulder , this is going to take some time , and somebody 's going to figure out soon enough we 're not even supposed to be here . i 'm in serious violation of medical ethics . 
i am delighted to be of service to you again , your highness . and i can tell you , my instructions came directly from the emperor , with a caution to be discreet . 
imagine a room full of women . <person> , blonde , wet with desire , <person> . a harem , if you will . me in leather . a harness , if you like . i am the object of this desire , and all eyes are on me as i speak . “ ladies , ” i begin . “ i am the love god , <person> . i intoxicate you . my spunk is to you manna from heaven ... 
lillian says it once a week . ` why does n't he come live with us ? ' 
i 'm beginning to catch up . 
yes ! 
come off it , <person> . i 'm late for work ... 
it will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more . 
the colonel helped me work it out . 
i asked you what you studied . 
how do you do that ? 
who 's been giving you history lessons ? your bartender ? 
i have a pretty good idea . 
i told you . we met yesterday . 
yeah , uh -- it was spanish-somethin ' <person> , or diego , uh -- 
does this sound strange to you ? 
my tribe , as you call it , lives on another planet in a distant solar system . 
tonight ? 
i 'm doing sixty years at otisville , no chance of parole . even if they cut my sentence in half i 'll be seventy-three years old . that 's some fucking deal . i do n't know if the parole board , the judge , the pope or <person> <person> himself can get me out of here . i have a really bad record , i 'm not sure what 's going to happen . 
spanky 's gon na be pissed ? <person> <person> . <person> <person> ! what the hell kind of a name is spanky , anyway ? you 're responsible for this situation . i blame you for everything . if it was n't for you , i 'd be home having a hot meal right now . 
what 's going on ? 
i 'll investigate <person> <person> 's financial position -- 
do you have a suit ? let 's get him <number> ... . and a cell phone too . and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue , make it that big <number> on fifth avenue , would you ? 
will you come soon ? 
you look ... different . 
oh . hi . <person> . 
he 's trying to impress you . 
i 'm the <number> sent you to toronto , <person> -- 
where ? and do n't tell me <person> <person> ... 
do you know who <person> <person> was with ? 
that 's right . not only that , but he gave his school money to his brother <person> , and sent him to college . <person> became a football star –– made second team all american . 
that 's all you 've got to say ? 
my god , <person> , you have to hear me ! the world we know will collapse ! everything we have devoted our lives to -- all patterns , all harmonies -- will be destroyed ! 
i get a 's . all a 's . 
yo ! <person> ! i won <number> hundred - what happened ? 
she has n't any friends left sine you started this oil business , and she never sees you . 
i don ’ t . 
we object , your honor . it would unfairly influence the jury . 
we just saved a little baby boy . think of it that way . 
got to be somewhere that 's hot . he said it was `` damnably hot . '' 
that 's how it is , chum . <number> column - and i can bring all this tumbling down . i can take you off the streets for good . 
what is ? 
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so . 
how much money is involved ? 
max , sit down . you 're in no shape to kill anybody . 
what are you doing ? 
who was this fuckin ' guy ? 
do n't wander off . 
you 've got to get me something i can use , <person> . 
murdered ? why ? 
they checked in . 
do n't lose any sleep over it . i would n't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat . 
why should anyone vote for him ? he 's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them . children - to be told <number> thing <number> day , something else the next , as the whim seizes him . and they 're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars . 
is that for <person> <person> ? 
<person> said it 'd be weeks till -- 
<person> set ? 
you ca n't hurt people ... and then just say , i 'm sorry , and then everything just gets washed away . why would heaven want people like that . people who ... do what they want and then ... switch . 
it had to get there somehow . 
listen , buster ... i hate caviar ! and i 'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head . 
i wonder if he 's some kind of mutant . that bear had to be surprised . 
how 's the journal ? 
i 've got 'em ! they 're back on my screens ! 
amanda , as ironic as this is gon na sound , i ca n't take any money for ... i 'm no midnight cowboy , y'know . it would only cheapen the whole deal for me . 
when did you talk to <person> ? 
do you play the piano ? 
stop this ! 
my son <person> came to see you this afternoon , and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house ? 
why not ? 
look , if you do n't let me out of this ... i'11 just ... i'11 just sit in my apartment all day . i wo n't go anywhere , i wo n't do anything . what kind of show will that be ? 
hey , can we go to mcdonald 's ? 
< u > i < /u > ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort -- 
go out the north exit ! there 's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases . run ! 
-- and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role . i really must congratulate you on writing <person> back in . a master stroke . 
go inside at once . 
when ? 
i do n't remember you . 
why do n't we take oxygen ? 
why know ? 
i 'll get in trouble . 
who 's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped , or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot ? 
is this the guy with the mustang ? 
you black ? 
do n't bullshit me ! if you know a way out of this place and you 're holding out -- 
how many colonists ? 
the police came to me for help . what could i do ? 
what kind of movies do they show there ? 
you 're the one with balls , <person> , say something like that to someone like <person> . or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute . 
but you ca n't just fire him . <person> 's his brother-in-law . he 's <person> <person> . 
you guys awake ? 
do you need money ? 
the food is on the table . 
anything to get the fuck out of dodge . 
linda ... hey , <person> ... 
let 's jump right into it . your show has sparked a world of controversy , provoked a tone of dialogue . how do you see all of this ? 
right . <person> assessor . 
palmed it right in the goddam chamber . 
i lost them , that 's what happened . 
the fact that you prevented it from happening does n't change the fact that it was going to happen . 
... so it crashes , and this guy , whoever he is , gets thrown out , or walks out , and ends up freezing . 
hey , <person> . 
i feel sick . 
i redecorated . what about you ? 
i do n't smoke . 
you may do that in the privacy of your room . 
another fifteen seconds to go . 
uh-huh . 
i am a fighting man and i am married to the quest . that is enough . 
this is crazy . 
is that what you think i was thinking ? 
i - ah - could n't think of anything else to do . i thought maybe you know something ... i 'm scared . 
he 's the guy <person> . 
when did you first do business with this bertrand ? 
you already have the checks , darling . 
well ... do n't you think it 's up to me to ... 
i 'm sorry , <person> <person> . but <person> 's in st. lukes now , so i 'm a little -- i 'm not myself . the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth 's offer , it 'll only get worse . 
what about the jack-o-lantern ? 
who was that man ? 
tommy , thanks for coming over . 
christy ? you want to be in `` heaven ? '' 
you ca n't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow* -- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is ? 
i know how to tag a damn conch ... . 
your marks would suggest great injury . 
... to fort mcgruder in his truck . 
thank you . 
listen , kid , i was sorry to hear about your mom . that 's pretty rough . i would 've returned your call a lot sooner but i was out at sea ... 
the girl out front mentioned <person> 's assistant , somebody named <person> . maybe he knows . 
what makes you think he hates you , <person> ? 
what do you know about the ear ? . anything ? 
yes , well , why do n't you show him around and ... 
nope . <person> . 
i do n't like him chasing around after you ... i do n't trust him ... . 
the question , <person> , is how are you feeling ? 
run faster they 're after us ! ! 
i 'll just take a minute . <person> <person> <person> . you know what i 'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a dr. <person> <person> , you know who he is ? 
spock . does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one ... ? 
where ? 
it is their wish . 
yeah , take pity on the feeble minded . 
you sure you wan na start off that big ? bet like that could put a real dent in us . 
jesus , <person> . yes . that was hilarious . that was you , was n't it ? 
hey ... honey , i do n't know <person> <person> . 
see you later . 
ed , how 're you holding up ? 
well <number> minutes ago you told me i was n't good enough for your daughter . now you say you 're sorry i got that impression . 
will your power outward .

what a hell cat . no controlling these modern girls . they 're terrible ! 
if you spent a little more time training them -- 
the truth is , i have n't had any mu-shu in <number> months . 
common-law wife . on top of that , there 's a child . 
no . 
yeah . 
how far have you gotten ? 
i thought you might be praying . 
you do n't expect me to do that do you ? 
i do n't want this . what are they ? 
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you . where 've you been hiding ? 
have we in some way made you angry , <person> ? 
all we need is the bookie setup for now . we 'll worry about the telegraph office later . 
then we take the south rim down the mountain and it 's <number> miles cross country to fort edward . 
no . 
the developing room . i need to ... see you . 
is n't that beautiful ? 
he was going to -- 
and they all came ... 
i have cramps . i ca n't believe i let you talk me into this . 
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action . 
that was a foolish thing to do . 
i 'd swear something was there sir , but i might have imagined it . 
because it 's wreckable . i took another look and i changed my mind . 
we think so . 
okay , let 's get down to it . i did my part and got you out . so now you tell me where we 're goin ' ? 
what do you think 's wrong with her ? 
yeah . <person> <person> says it in -- 
how do i contact you ? we still do n't have the atm info . 
did you now ? on which bounce ? 
well , i do n't know . he do n't need any trouble from you . 
but they would ! do n't you see ? 
no , my cocktail steward . look , if you 're interested in whether i 'm married or not - 
first of all , <person> , you do n't have an ex , secondly , it 's a fucking show dog with fucking papers . you ca n't board it . it gets upset , its hair falls out . 
so talk to us about something . 
you know why . you already said . 
elliot ? 
forget it . i 'm sick of working for that dickhead . 
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa . 
i 'm sorry . i really should n't have -- 
industrial espionage is not ridiculous . <person> , how do you know she has n't attached herself to you so she can bring <person> back information ? 
dickhead ? 
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate . 
do n't you remember ? 
you ca n't learn that in an office . eh ? he 's right . you have to learn it on the streets . you ca n't buy that . you have to live it . 
it 's almost like a conspiracy , huh ? 
you do n't understand . i 'm just so < u > relieved < /u > . i was < u > sure < /u > you 'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy . 
anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case ? she 's the expert . i need help . 
i was hoping we could talk . 
but he 's never there . 
that 's me . 
exactly . and you did have a 'relationship ' with lieutenant ilia , commander . 
well nothing audible to us . maybe the lab can pick something up . 
after that , i plan to read some music and rest for awhile . 
an outside person . a foreigner . a barbarian . you , me . more you . 
what about mrs. <person> and ... ? 
but why would a man need more than <number> woman ? 
you would risk your life for strangers ? 
i never stop thinking about it , <person> . the only way in or out of this school is through that gate , and it is secured at all times . 
i 've got to see you . 
i turn you over again , today , <person> . <number> day , you will not be able to come running to us . 
you ever been to jail ? 
well ... yah . 
then quit . you should be going to school anyway ... 
it took a long time , but eventually i learned to live with it . and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me . i knew things about people , about events , about time . 
no , i ... 
is that <person> ? 
where you off to ? 
nick , what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn < u > doctor < /u > . 
time is running out . we have to go see <person> <person> . we have to talk to her . 
you win , colonel . here 's the fifty . go on out and get rid of it . 
i have thought about it , yes . 
but you were n't . i could tell . 
helen , you 're becoming more beautiful every day . what are we going to do about it ? 
<number> ? '62 ? mary clarence , that 's when many of us took final vows . it 's the last secular music we recall . 
i < u > think < /u > i see it . 
i mean they want to get caught . 
mrs. rand . 
they got him surrounded some place -- gon na shoot him like a dog ! 
... you 're not gon na screw me on this ? 
what do you want ? 
well , if you do n't mind me sayin ' so , he sounds like a real asshole . 
rules are made to be broken . 
you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball . 
here we go again . 
please do n't leave . i 'm going to talk to you . what 's your name ? 
or a supporting actor - 
so am i. thy father will have to know of thy lying . 
i 'm not afraid . i toured for a year with the national puppet company 's production of `` long day 's journey into night . '' 
yeah . 
is n't that what you 'd expect them to say ? 
that was nineteen years ago , and they were simple gambling pinches . 
but i did live . 
yeah . 
how do you know that ? 
that 's what it 's about . 
i am now , sir . 
that 's great ! 
what 's all that ? 
mmm , hmmm . you shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off . when i got drafted first it was the happiest day of my <person> 's life . he likes baseball more than i do ... 
shit ! i ... i , which way ? 
the sounds , but not the language . we would be responding in gibberish . 
they 're paramedics . they wait at <number> feet . 
i liked it better when there were just the <number> of us . 
vancouver , b.c . 
you could have knocked me down with a feather -- selectman -- me . 
this is a.t.f . agent <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> <person> money exchange trial run . it 's <number> p.m. , <person> <number> <number> . the location is the parking structure at lax .

you want me to take you somewhere ? 
there 's always exceptions . 
darling <person> . 
and where are they going with it ? 
there 's no mistake ? you 're absolutely sure ? 
you remember me ?

<person> <person> ... is the dark side stronger ?

it has entered <person> orbit . correction -- it is not in orbit . it is heading directly toward the surface . 
jeanne ... get up ... this is ridiculous ... 
hi walter . 
you ought to write these stories down . 
i been thinking . maybe i should drop you in montgomery . i mean , the way things are going , it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to atlanta .

so , you never heard of him . 
hey , what 're you doing here ? 
mike , because of the earth 's rotation we 're only in line with <person> so many hours a day ; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations . if dr. <person> had n't moved quickly we could have lost key elements . 
`` always be closing ... '' 
<person> kincaid ? 
what 's in here then , lead ? 
`` chat ? '' did you just say `` chat ? '' 
we 've been closed for a while .

hell , they are staring . what 's that shit on your face ? 
oh , but you < u > have < /u > , ma'am . you lied to us , that could be obstruction of justice . a man 's been killed in part <number> of your silence , i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and i 'm sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat your cows . 
objection ! 
oh , really ? i 'm from playskool . 
talcott does n't usually show up at the office 'till after his <number> holes . what are they nervous about ?

i will not fail you . i 'm not afraid . 
we do n't want to bother you any , we -- 
i 've come to feel it 's my thing . you know , you take a job ... you take a job , and , many times , it 's < u > just < /u > a job . and then ... 
do we have to listen to this shit ? 
mademoiselle , you are in rick 's and <person> is -- 
come on , bargain with me . 
kz ... 7-0 ... 7-0 ... <number> . it checks out .

they have n't done the standard scratch test . where they make small injections into the skin ? 
it 's a rebound . 
oh , <person> <person> ... . 
and the seas would boil ... 
i am ergo the magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision . 
like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time -- watchin ' the little fella toddling off -- in his best bib and tucker -- and you sink in the middle -- hoping he can stand up to the other kids -- wo n't get his feeling hurt -- and -- if you could only spare him the knocks he 's got ta take -- say -- who started this ? 
what were you doing there ? 
i will not talk about the other <number> .

george , listen to what you 're saying . this thing 's changed itself into a man . disappearing may not be that big a deal . 
oh hello . 
of course . 
i only know we 've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away . 
how'n hell a dumb bronx kid like you know that ? 
then you know how bravely your son met his death . 
donny ! please ! 
we were married <number> years before the baby . and then <number> very difficult years . 
this is new york city , it ’ s like the needy people capital of the world . those jersey clients of yours aren ’ t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here ... 
i want to tell you it 's a great honor to meet you and talk to you . 
well , i kind of hate to point it out , but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation ... and as you know , we used up most of that time in harvesting . 
i certainly do . 
you 're applying for my internship , are n't you ? 
i 'm not tired . i thought i might finish <person> 's skirt . 
oh , i suppose so .

daddy ?

at the zoo . 
<person> said you were thinking of leaving . true ?

that 's what you got me here for at <number> o'clock in the morning , 'cause there 's a spider in the bathroom ? 
i 'm not looking for a tape . what i need is -- 
where we headed ? 
would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance -- 
i do n't want to interfere , or anything ... but she 's split up from her boy- friend , that 's right is n't it ? 
yes . 
what 's he got in there ? 
i must have the breakdown now . where is <person> ? 
your eyes are puffy . did you take valium again ? 
do n't we have any chopsticks ? 
and you too , <person> . 
we need money first ... 
she hit it , <person> <person> ! 
well , technically i did what ya said . 
i just have a hard time with insipid , sexist violence . 
like testicular cancer ? 
not now , <person> -- which is the right way to say this ? you 're dumber than me -- or -- you 're dumber than i ? 
i 'm not sure . 
i 'm thinking about painting the kitchen . what color do you like , <person> ? are you there ? 
there was a car in the lot when we closed . gone today .

yeah , i guess that 's tragedy right there . 
and now ? 
do you know who was brought in for questioning ? 
and , what a great pleasure it is , indeed , to meet you , <person> . 
where have you been ... 
father , i have betrayed my family . i betrayed my men . and i betrayed you . 
then i have come to the right place . 
double-meaning intended -- 
look . 
how ... how was <person> <person> ? 
no . no . you 've been officially depressed for like <number> years now , and you were always a negative guy anyway , even in college . now it 's worse -- you 're wasting away . teaching english to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote . your books . 
delgado ? 
he does n't think so much of you either . 
just thought you might want to talk . 
feeling better ? 
i have never been on this island !

honey , the meeting today is going to be fine . do n't get in an uproar . 
<person> juno , i 'm really convinced . 
what 's this ? 
perhaps the `` jam-in-ator '' appeals to you . absolutely no practice necessary . you shread like a giant . just press a button . 
it ai n't for lack of trying . 
you get half mine and i get half yours . 
i do n't know ! i do n't know anything any more ! i just need to be by myself . 
i used to think i had the perfect mom , perfect family . till i found out i was wrong . she had a secret life , and i tried to understand that , and soon as i thought i had , more secrets . i do n't ' know who my mom was . sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about my mother for the first time . you know , with tv and those movies and what not . god sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about myself for the first time . like i 'm watching my life instead of living in it . 
yes , i see that private <person> was reported missing in action and is presumed dead . i also see that you were posted stateside during the war . fort dix ? 
what now ? 
did he mention the mayflowers ? 
maybe you and <person> want to go with us ? 
course you 're feeling fine ... you almost made a monster the mayor of <person> <person> . 
where 's the rubber band ? 
sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel ... <number> you probably could n't even sell ... what would you need to get away , to start a new business , somewhere else ? forty <number> dollars ? 
no . 
affirmative , captain . our readings are well below danger level . 
i hope so 
no , she 's looking for you . 
and sir , i also get that broken- mirror , black-cat , friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this <number> ... . 
what the fuck are you talkin ' about ? 
i know that i just do n't feel a connection with very many people , so i do n't waste time with people i do n't feel <number> with . 
yeah . yeah , she 's fine . 
well , i 've seen him here and there . what 's on your mind ? 
what of my lips , will you soil them too ? when you 've broken every other taboo ? 
here -- here it is . here 's your pocketbook , <person> . 
not here , <person> 'll be calling at <number> to find out what 's happening . 
i did n't forget . 
that 's good . keep it at forty . 
i 'll tell <person> <person> at once , sir . have a seat . 
rug samples . 
signs and wonders . but i think once you stop hearin ' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow . 
go to hell ! 
do n't call yourself fat . 
why , a list of the guests . that 's the usual thing , is n't it ? 
why ... ? <person> , why ... ? 
nothing . 
<person> jammed gum in the locks . 
who 's the hell is that ? 
if it was a dope deal , where 's the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ? 
not in that way ; you 're always looking for company . 
remember dress up day ? you and <person> lifting skirts during recess . 
if the key 's on him , to get the key we 'd have to . . . 
what about the powwow safe ? 
naw ... 
<person> lundegaard ? 
not that i do n't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me ? 
-- i want to be <person> . 
my little web did that ? 
well i parked illegally . see y'later ? 
then do n't go to hollywood . 
it 's gon na be great . 'caring about his wife . ' 'spending time on her favorite issue ... ' 
pop ... . 
yes ? 
i 'd like it if you could stay the night . 
[ this is not possible . but in that house i have money . if i tell you where -- ] 
you 're kidding . 
i 'm really sorry that i hurt you , brian . 
wow . a gold record , man , that 's great . so you 're , you 're like living the wild life now , huh ? 
oh , no , i just lost a little weight , that 's all . well , you look nice . 
a lot of people think you 're a snitch . it 's dangerous ... 
really . what 'll i pin this on ? 
doctors and nurses can only do so much , <person> . they ca n't cure everything . 
do you like me even a little bit ? 
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients . 
she was killed , <person> . 
do n't you worry , captain . we 'll beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push . 
who brought up this bright idea ? 
i thought the plan was we 'd evacuate them after we got through . 
i am the death of real . 
i 'm getting -- - left behind . 
good work , <person> <person> . you 'll do . 
this is miles from the battle lines . they were probably deserters . 
nothing , for the moment . 
and who 's gon na find out ? 
why do you need to wreck this company ? 
this is l939 . ca n't you subtract ? 
sounds like heavy artillery ... 
it 's ... behind ... us . 
are you alright ? 
i 've got to get back . 
that 's right , <person> . 
and you , are you in love with any <number> else ? 
now do n't get carried away- 
we ca n't drop it now , <person> . we bought the land around this dam and we 're holding it in dummy names . if we drop it or delay it -- we are going to bring about investigations , and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the state under phoney names . no , <person> , in my judgment the only thing to do is push this dam through -- and get it over with . 
so you 're saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with <person> <person> ? 
hey ! where 're you off to ? 
but since we 're both here , i think it 's time to take a fresh look at our relationship . 
you 'll be dining with the captain , and he requests you wear this . 
bye mom . 
what do you read ? what 's the last book you read ? 
<person> <person> -- fran . 
can i ask - my friend , can he come in ? just for a few minutes ? 
<person> einstein plays shuffleboard . 
it 's a desert . that 's what deserts do at night ; they get cold . 
i just want the key to my jewelry , and i want you to let me go . 
is n't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche ? 
jesus , <person> . 
beat it ! 
yeah . 
i ca n't take any more school . 
i 'm only asking what you think . 
should probably ask him that . 
dying . 
no . no . stay down , <person> , sit back down on that couch -- 
hiya , <person> . 
there 's a place over there on the bluffs . when the fog is just right , like tonight , the lights of main look like a kaleidoscope . 
yeah . i service video equipment . 
no , wait . just listen . i hooked it up earlier tonight , and it said my name . as soon as i turned it on , <person> . it said my name . how could it know ? and then , i asked it where <person> was , and it said , `` in here '' . 
you 're hurting . 
grant . oh my god . what happened to your -- ? 
<person> said -- - 
do you think that 's a good idea ? 
that possibly ... the valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally ? 
no ... no you 're wrong . 
what time was it , mrs. halligan ? 
um , ted , i need a moment with <person> -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom . 
what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ... 
like you do n't know ... 
bruce , really , when i say these things i do n't mean to criticize you . 
no , i have to ask you a favor ... you 're the only one who 'll understand . 
i 'm sorry , baby . i 'm so sorry . 
nick - i wo n't have you going down there . 
uh-huh . want <number> ? 
so what have we got ? 
what 's a jizz-mopper ? 
just a walk , for chrissakes . 
and his wife ? 
oh , that 's all right , i 've got lots more . want to see the reception ? 
oh ? 
turn around ? 
i told you my father died in jail . he stole a fortune . most of it pretty dirty money . i do n't care to have that known . 
never heard of him . 
he does n't know about the day care . 
would you know where i might reach her ? 
sure , <person> . 
look butthead , i 'll treat you so nice you 'll never want to let me go , okay ? 
great ! you 're going to believe that fat dweeb <person> <person> over your own daughter . 
he 's my son and i like him the way he is . why do you always have to pick on him ? if it 's not the boy it 's me . you do n't like the way i live -- you do n't like my friends , or my new house -- or anything . 
you 're right . i 'm cracking up . ignore me . 
skinny lunger , your guns do n't impress me . was n't for those guns you 'd be nothin ' . 
i helped you because i 'm an idiot ! ask my mother , i love it when people take advantage of me ! i trusted you ! ! i thought he was real ! 
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down . 
patience , kal-el . you begin to sound like an earthling . superman mother , you speak only of honor , of sacrifice , of responsibility -- 
how old are you ? 
we saw . 
i 'm sure that will please the maharajah , captain . 
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied , does n't it , <person> <person> ? 
and after that ? 
looks like a chipmunk . 
perhaps an arrangement can be reached . 
do you know what you 've done ! ? do you know ? 
but you do n't keep a cat , do you ? 
of course not . only by a director of the firm . who 'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets ? 
<person> does not play a lunatic , birdie . 
listen , <person> , i 'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important . 
<person> grier . 
i know <person> . no . 
is it a boy or a girl ? 
bartok ... have you ever been to paris ? 
you mean ... you mean ... vera ! vera ! the magnitude of this ! ! ! 
has n't anyone ever told you that before ? 
i 'd use the word insane . 
you 'll be fine . 
oh , please . come on , <person> . you 're fucking your wife 's sister and you hardly been married a year . you 're a liar . but at least i know you 're a liar . it 's the people that do n't know , like <person> , that have to watch out . 
it 's your money . you talk . 
use your head , you dumb bitch ! he 's acting out the secret agent role from his ego trip ! 
i do n't know -- 
well , they needed immediate answers , frances . it 's good manners and good sense . you should n't be bothering yourself with these right now . 
it must have slipped my mind . 
judge ... i ... i shoulda told you this before but ... well ... fuck ... 
defense against what ? 
that 's hardly a substitute . 
the windows do n't open . 
uh-huh ! 
i want to ask you a big favor , <person> . <person> drop the bluestar deal . 
jack , no . i just explained the whole thing to you . it was just between me and <person> , if it had anything to do with you and <person> , i woulda told you about it . 
besides attending all your regular classes , i 'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school -- 
okay . hi . 
you 'll see her . 
call off the cat and i 'll kill you , <person> . 
are you a traveller ? 
i 'm saying it now ! 
i do n't even know what this is . this sort of thing ai n't my bag , baby . 
i 'm sorry for everything . 
who is that other guy ? 
he tapes their mouths shut . we found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths . we 're doing a chemical analysis for components , but it 's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store . 
you think <person> will go for it ? 
what do they look like ? 
be gentle , child . <person> <person> is an old woman . 
girlfriend ? 
you ai n't doin ' so good , <person> . you need help . you should talk to hershe . she hates <person> . they used to be partners , but they split up . 
it 's not going to be lonely , <person> . not for you and not for me . 
what airport would you use . 
jorge , <person> <person> 's son , at your service . 
well ... maybe ... 
why special ? 
ms. grey -- you work at a school for mutants in westchester , new york . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ? 
guenevere ...

now that 's no way to spend your hard- earned money ! 
different mothers , huh ? 
why ? 
you swine ! 
it 's only for the license . there 's a three-day wait - blood tests , things like that ... 
i presume by this method that you 'll be able to uncover some new clue , either a handkerchief or an article of clothing ... in other words , something which your men have not been able to find as yet . 
bree , what 's actually happened ? it was n't that bad . 
what do we do ? let'em know we 're here ... .or what ? 
no -- i was just -- maybe -- 
i mean , i 'm eighteen years old and i 've never even had a real , steady boyfriend for more than like <number> weeks !

it is of no concern . soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be <number> of us ! your work here is finished , my friend . go out to the command ship and await my orders .

how do you know they 're done ? 
i got out of there . i just grabbed up my stuff , and then i found it . 
... child at the airport ... breaks through the ranks , runs to `` old shoe '' -- should we have < u > flower < /u > or a < u > bear < /u > ... ? 
but there 's <number> thing i envy you for . 
just take it in stride . 
really ! still , it remains to be seen why she invented a shark . what was her purpose in that ? 
i 'm almost finished . i 'm about to come to the punch line . 
i 've just met with the bishop . we 're taking you off the case . 
i told you .

the incident of the other night is a nuisance that i can take care of . i came to you because i want nothing to affect our agreement ; i wanted to clear everything i 'm going to do with you , just in case . 
shut up ! i saw you . you were in the car . 
you must bring them to <person> <person> -- on vulcan . only there is the passage possible . only there can both find peace ... 
francie , you know i ca n't do that . 
toby ... who the fuck is <person> ? toby ... toby ... think ... think ... think ... 
so i do n't know about horror . 
it may not have been an accident . they never did find her head ... 
unless it 's illegal in the uk to serve liquids below room temperature : i do n't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims ... 
whatiya mean ? 
she needs to stop running around like a little boy . 
listen to me . you keep on thinking i 'm somebody ho lacks ... confidence . that 's not it . i know i can talk well enough and i 'm not bad at making contact with people , but i do n't like the feeling that i 'm pretending to be a reporter . and half the time i do n't really get the news i 'm talking about . it is n't that i 'm down on myself . trust me , i stink . 
<number> . 
what 's that ? 
you mean a picture ? 
all you been through ... i ever tell you what a good friend you are ? 
have n't seen it . 
so that 's it ... 
i have never heard <number> . 
i mean , does <number> love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is <number> 's father ? 
what ? ! 
he 's in this somehow ... i do n't know how . just stay close to faith . 
would you like me to seduce you ? 
and the draft blew over the flowers . 
yes . 
let 's go outside and talk . 
you 're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to i.d . you . 
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night ? 
well , if you 're sure it would n't -- no use combing my hair for nothing . 
they do n't come better . but i do n't deny there are times i wonder about things i wo n't have . maybe <number> day i 'll get to see egypt . maybe not . but i know if you try too many different lives , you can wind up with no life at all ... 
are you okay ? 
does she know about it ? she 's in it ! 
are you sure ? 
i got contacts . <person> <person> , if you pointed them at me i 'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do . either way you still get the desired effect . 
but wait , you do n't understand- 
what are you doing here ? 
did you invite them ? 
<person> ' to save his girl , man . he 's in another world . 
i ca n't . i have too much to do .

she never proved anything , not a thing ! 
i 'm getting emotional . and i do n't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand , <person> ? 
what is it ? ! 
are you going to shoot us all , tough guy ? 
<person> jack , i 'm getting all weepy . 
we did n't get that far . 
what are you talking about ? 
leave me alone , brother . i 've never seen you before . <person> shouts to other meths drinkers and tramps . 
i tell you , this station will be operational as planned . 
ah fuck it .

mm . 
no shit ? 
i could force you . 
good morning . i worried about you , last night . you should n't have run like that . 
come on in . 
thanks . 
let 's get hitched . i guess i , you know , love you . it 's a beautiful thing . 
i learned it from listening to you ! i hate you ! 
you might have mentioned me first . 
victor , <person> <person> . 
... you 're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she 's telling me you have n't even met with them ... 
yeah , well , lots of couples are imcompat ... 
get control of yourself !

you getting out too ? 
oh , baby , what an idea . i 'd always be happy to see you , no matter what . 
excellent .

holding my own . you know that guy who was calling me all the time ? he 's started again . he 's been putting stuff in my mail . 
red cross over to blue double blue ... is that what it is ? a squid ?

just wondering .

ca n't you open the door ? ! 
i 'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just wo n't give me a tumble -- date-wise . 
you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life , telling folk <number> thing , and then going off to do another ? there 's quite a few who come here , hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life . and they 're all 'merchant marines . ' 
who 's that sitting in your car ? 
and i 'm usually in bed by ten-thirty . 
... you do n't have to make a <number> dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment . 
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it . maybe the trouble is n't with the joke . maybe it 's with you ! 
you did n't buy batteries ? 
you made a phone call and you said you 'd help a girl out and then you did n't ... .i 'm here to get the money . 
oww ! why 'd you do that ? 
when ? 
what does that do ? 
alright , let 's check it out . 
what the fuck are you talking about ? i converted when i married <person> ! come on , <person> ! 
i knew it ! i knew a night 's rest was n't possible in this house ! <person> !

starla , it ai n't -- 
mrs. macdougall , i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot .

are you all right ? 
what do you mean ? 
no . 
i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here . 
you want what ? ! 

very well . but if this thing gets worse , we must close . if there 's anything you need , call anytime . 
just being happy ? just stopping all this nonsense about <person> - and <person> and me ? 
how much do you know about it ?

they 're going to talk to my father , which means they 're going to ask him for something , which means they better get it right . 
you love me now , do n't you ? 
what ? 
where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes <person> <person> records ? she could at least have the decency to call me back .

no we should n't , but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime ! 
i do n't want you to lie . 
i almost got married once . 
q 's retirement party . i 'd just put the knife into the cake , and - 
that 's all ? 
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory ... 
thank-you ... 
... your room does that too ? 
what is that supposed to mean ... ? 
i did n't mean to scare you like that . 
mmm , it tastes so good . mr . <person> , i do n't know how i can ever thank you . 
i 'm fine . have you seen <person> ? 
what if i say i 'll go out with you , so you can have all these great daydreams , but then never actually talk to you again ? 
<person> ? 
did i hear a car ? 
whatever made you want to do a tour down here ? 
<person> <person> must be on the premises someplace . 
do you think she 's safe ? 
i knew it , i knew it , go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon ! 
where ? 
i always do . 
-- but , in here , in everyone , there 's the squint of a five-day headache . yet they forced themselves to be positive . they never said `` parasite ; '' they said `` agent . '' they always talked about getting better . 
the aliens ... in the mother ship . you look just like him . 
do you think you know me like that ? 
well , she has <number> mouth in ten <number> , i do n't see teeth like that once in <number> years . her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth , but there is n't a cavity in her head , not a single one . she has perfect teeth . 
yeah , i guess so . 
it 's my name . maybe that sounds silly to you but ... 
all i 'm saying is when you 're hanging on by your fingernails , you do n't go waving you arms around . 
chicken pox ? i was <number> . he did n't leave <number> i was twelve . 
no thanks , i must go , but maybe you could get some beers for the guys . 
that oughta do it . 
what ? 
reach into my pocket . 
we march on <person> <person> de <person> within the hour . 
<person> was not a stranger , he was our neighbor . 
you think so ? 
she was taken . 
that 's under lock and key . 
tomorrow night , whisper a new tale to your neighbor , <person> . he 'll whisper it to his neighbor <person> , who 'll whisper it to his neighbor <person> -- 
what 's the point ? 
that 's all taken care of . you see , <person> <person> . either you bring the water to l.a. or you bring l.a. to the water . 
what ... ! -- 
'fraid i ca n't . there 's been a kidnapping ... tell selina ... ms. kyle ... that some business came up -- no , tell her some major deal fell through , she 'll feel sorry ... no , no , here 's what to do , just tell her ... let her know that i ... not in a dumb `` be my girlfriend way , '' but -- 
lawyers . i do n't know , <person> -- firing me is going to be very tough on you . it 's going to be hard to get over . there will be therapy bills for you . 
no cigarettes . 
<person> viola . 
you know , you 're telling me that a helicopter ca n't land here ... 
stu - stop it . that monkey is < u > good luck < /u > . you thought him up , and everybody loves him , and he 's probably going to make you rich . so relax ! enjoy it ! 
i am delighted to see you , <person> <person> . 
no ... let 's walk through the city . 
excuse me ? 
i believe so . 
you think it 's a good idea taking it back to yours ? 
what should we do ? what if he recognizes us ? 
and what do you do for mankind ? 
all right , go ahead , get her on the witness stand ! what can she say ? 
you saved my life , <person> . i never would 've made it without you . 
i did . is n't it neat-o ? 
he does n't have the desire somehow . our killer seems to have more purpose . more purpose than <person> could ever conceive of . 
i might . 
you 're still mad at me , are n't you ? 
and `` <person> ? '' 
what are we waiting for ? 
i never saw him before . 
do n't forget to open it for me . i ca n't be opening my own bottle . 
you do n't have a brain tumor . he did n't say you had a brain tumor . mickey no , naturally they 're not gon na tell you , because , well , you know , th -- , sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em . 
well ... how can i put this . there were <number> truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them . because < u > i < /u > had trouble reconciling them . <person> said . 
yessir . she refuses them all . 
just the name of this hospital , st. severin . he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness . 
no , please . 
well , the good news is that the results are negative . i 've found no evidence in the way of lesions , hemorrhaging , tumors ... 
i quit . 
old ? ! come look at this ! she has wounds . wounds on her head . like thrashes . or bites . 
the fax machines . 
what year is it ? 
he helped you ? 
i got you those trousers from <person> <person> . 
wow . <person> , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour . 
yeah , that 's old , in a tree . 
it 's good to see you . well -- could we do it first and then just talk ? 
what 's more interesting than boffing the girlscout ? 
i thought you did n't respect money ! 
i am sort of scattered . 
how did i get here ? 
they both have some growing up to do . but they 're good people , they 're starting with love . they 've got time . 
whichever you prefer . 
were you followed ? 
my father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden . 
lays it on a little thick , does n't he ? if you ask me , he 's <number> giant bore . 
thank you . am i going to see you in new york ? 
why do people think anything ? 
according to my calculations , we should be right under the statue . we 'll come up right between his legs . oh my . 
if your duty requires it . 
i agree . 
what ? no ... 
what ? 
could you believe it ? 
i do n't use my wife for business purposes , <person> <person> ! 
what i do n't understand is why they asked <person> if <person> was a virgin . they could have asked you <person> . 
i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something . 
wow . 
really . 
his yacht ? 
how did they get away ? 
commodore , you ca n't do that ! 
he 's threatened to do it , it 's been building up in him for months . 
times gone , fort holland was a fort ... now , no longer . the holland 's are a most old family , miss . they brought the colored people to the island -- the colored folks and ti-misery . 
hi , baby . 
you may take her now . 
ya do n't say . 
what do you mean , they take out her butt ? 
what the fuck , man ? what do you people want ? i did what you wasi'cu 's told me to do . 
this is lieutenant doolittle calling <person> # <number> . i repeat previous order , you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay . do you understand ? 
yes i did . 
other people always know so much more than we know -- so much more than they 're willing to tell us . 
bullshit . 
it 's pretty exciting . 
do n't `` hi mom '' me . what are you still doing up ? it 's past <number> ! 
i do n't remember you at all- you - you saved my life- bizarre thing to say , is n't it ... ? 
a window onto the human condition ? 
without me . 
you can do that ? 
is it all right ? i made it out to cash . you did n't tell me the name of the play . 
i was going to say ... your eyes look a little red . 
this is n't a `` moral '' issue , <person> . we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gon na go down the tubes . the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put <person> in and not <number> of their own . <person> , china , the soviet union : when you look at the big picture , <person> , you 'll see we 're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world . let 's not screw it up with some shit-ass , third-rate burglary . 
i told her today i need to end it . 
-- who 'll whisper it to <person> -- 
i thought they were clever . 
... rumor is <person> , a local boy , was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement . no one really knows what they were doing there , but everyone sure saw 'em . they stood out like cottonballs . i got whites and blacks saw 'em , but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote . we still got the negro junkie , <person> <person> , saw 'em talkin ' at the seawall near <person> <person> . but it 's tough , boss - no one wants to talk about <person> . he 's ... 
<person> . <person> , you sue me , your husband dies , you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato , and all of it quicker than wind from a duck 's ass . excuse me . then you ask me to lie to the police . 
it 's your mother is n't it ? pulling strings again . 
this is easy . 
had push it in . funny thing ; it would n't start . 
oh my , would n't that be tragic ? to know that you could never be a putterer . 
where the hell were you ? 
where 's the name sheet ? 
it 's so ... small . 
i 'm happy that you 're working again . as long as it comes naturally , that 's terrific . you 've always liked working with your hands , have n't you ? 
todd , there 's a picture of whitman over the door . what does he remind you of ? quickly , <person> , do n't think about it . 
you 're telling me . 
get ready , frank . missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there . there 's gon na be trauma tonight ! 
no . i was living with you , remember ? we 've slept together but we have n't made love . not yet . but i 'll tell you <number> thing . the sleeping together is better . 
my ... my head . 
you 're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track ? 
where is he ? my son . 
has she ever spoken to you about me ? 
it 's <person> ... he 's in mexico city ... 
such nonsense , what do you all take me for - little nell from the country ? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing , carefully hidden no doubt- 
fancy some lunch after we_re through with this meccano shit ? 
is your stateroom alright ? 
your horses are hungry , that 's what she did say , come sit down beside me , an ' feed them some hay . my horses ai n't hungry , they wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee ... 
be careful . 
yes , i 've been asking for weeks , a month , i do n't know , also my leg was - 
he is good . <person> not as good as price . 
would you like to walk the rest of the way ? it 's so nice out . 
our <person> is very rich in a metal called gold , which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world . so we merely . . . 
thank you for seeing us ... we ... just felt that it was time to discuss ... 
it would seem so , <person> 
uh-huh . so what are you doing here ? 
oh . 
your uncle <person> stopped by to visit me . 
hey , it 's you . 
my condolences . 
he was n't even in the car ? 
i think he 's in a conference . unfortunately . i 'm really sorry . 
today is bath day .

mrs. grant , governor ... i wo n't hurt you . 
of course . drown them like puppies . 
temple , i caught your act the other night and - 
<number> weeks , sir . but you do n't have <number> weeks so i 'll do it for ya in <number> . 
let us give each other complete happiness , and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires , they will each time be born anew . 
yes , ma . 
she 's very beautiful . 
why do n't you pick some other spot ? it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning . 
what am i supposed to do , seth ? he recognized us . 
he wants me to take his car and his client to baltimore . 
how about <person> ? is she a fuck to the century , too ? 
you 're watching t.v . and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist . 
i know ... 
uh ... how long ago was this ? 
i never made it to korea . 
if they ask you questions , and they probably will ask you questions , would you please say something nice about him mum ? help him ? 
what the fuck ? i just asked you for a job yesterday ! 
then what was it ? 
actually , i was planning on running down to kinkos . do you think you could give me ride ? 
soup ? rice ? what are we doing , beginning all over again ? 
well , yah , i got an idea . how 's that <person> workin ' out for ya ? 
i saw the blood . it looks like motor oil . 
do me this favor just once . use the ponds . 
i 'm sorry . i did n't do it ! can i still have my dog ? 
do n't judge a comic book by it 's cover . 
<number> desoto highway . <person> , florida . 
<person> giant . just check . 
you must think i 'm mad . 
you 're welcome . 
hi . how are you feeling ? 
kara and <person> never showed up tonight . we 'd better go home and check on them . there 's nothing else for us to do here . 
why not ? 
we could have cut it off at the main computer ... 
benjamin ? 
was he involved at all , do you think , in occultism or satan worship ? 
where are they ? 
e.e . cummings . i 'd like to get you this . 
you doing a story on this guy ? 
he 's not gon na stop , satch . he 's gon na keep on ... 
they 're still looking for him . 
in order to keep <person> away from you -- i am prepared to tell her everything . 
on the contrary , you 're not strange . and that in itself is confusing . i have the same idea about shangri- la . the sense that i 've been here before , that i belong here . 
they 're going to kill me next . that 's what i hear . these new indians are destroying everything . our people are a quiet people . 
<person> 's dead , we do n't know about <person> . 
do they have an ocean ? i 've heard about the ocean . 
eating <person> , just like the last time you asked . 
<person> <person> got it right ? 
who the hell ever is . this is the most protected shipment we 've got -- and the most useless . these bills are n't even < u > in < /u > circulation ; the <number> thousand dollar bills we 're transporting are only used for international banking exchange . 
there was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger . they came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves . 
something bad happened to <person> and me , did n't it ? 
my pleasure . 
<person> 's a good man . 
have you taken a wrong turn , <person> <person> ? 
what ? 
forget it . no way . i got here first . 
yes , that would certainly do ... 
there are planes falling out of the sky , buildings blowing up . < i > american < /i > buildings . < i > americans < /i > getting bombs in the mail . what are we gon na do ! ? 
and what am i ? 
you ca n't say that to the president ... put back `` president '' ... now let 's hear how sounds . 
but you were among the british , they were your friends - why betray them ? 
i 'm up here too , maverick . 
professor tripp ? can i ask you a question ? 
when may i expect the cleaners ? 
you finished here ? 
well , go on and take it . work for somebody else ! that 's the gratitude i get for -- 
invulnerable . 
i believe the last time we came across <number> of these , was at the ballet . what were your words ... <number> fucking c.d . this case is closed . ' 
mom , please . 
i would n't worry <person> . i can always get you out ... i 'll screw every prison official in texas if i have to . 
i will be returning to vulcan within the hour ... i wanted to take my leave of you . 
what do you want me to do ? just sit here and wait ? faithful little <person> . pull the shades down and sit . when you feel like coming back , you 'll come back . and you 'll love me . and then you 'll go away again . is that your idea of love ? 
i saw him with you . 
calm down and get in your position . 
<person> mary , full of grace -- the house is growing ! 
um , okay . i 'll call my study partner . 
whoops ! yikes , i did n't expect to see you up here . 
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross . all the heavenly angels must envy your grace . 
it 's nothing . 
<number> of <person> <person> 's deputy sheriffs were rushed to the hospital -- 
<person> , i 'm going to need information on <person> <person> <person> 's background . 
<number> night more wo n't matter . your friend 'll be there . anyway i do n't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch . he knows you 're out so he ai n't going to sit still for it . 
there 's something wrong with this yogurt . 
that i am very little different from him . 
you think the killer and the desecrator are the same ? 
say the words , `` i understand . '' 
hey listen , i did n't know your mama was comin ' by ... 
pete , i 'm so sorry about what they did to you . i did n't think you 'd come back , i thought you 'd want to write again ... 
no touch . no touch . no touch . 
but not you . 
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you ? 
small , blond , good-looking . she was with him when we met . she had a funny english accent . 
what do you mean ? 
you know what i 'd like to see ? meat in a cone . you could put corned beef hash in a cone , or chopped liver . 
yeah , real cute . the storm is fake , but the lightening is real . 
many worthy of attention ; but valuing is something more . i could value only someone whom i loved . 
is something the matter ? 
yes , sir . 
what 'd you say about me ? 
how do you know it was a 'he ' ? 
well , you see , <person> i figure the big problem is the supermarkets . but <person> 's shop , that 's a specialized trade . the supermarkets do n't carry italian meat . 
he 's asleep . 
you 're spoilt because you 're an only child . you need a brother . or i do . i 'm weary of you both . 
i do n't care . 
i sent a female in . the room in question was rented by an anglo , cash ; since then , nothing -- no activity , no phone response . 
... people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you 're doing ... and that you are who you say you are ? 
taken what ? 
do n't tell them you 're lost . you 'll never live it down . 
do n't call me old man . ai n't you got no respect , boy ? 
so . you 're gon na need a man through here , <number> men at the cage , <number> to cover the count . you 're gon na need a lookout outside , a sweeper through the back , and a gun guarding the front . you need <number> . 
you 'll never guess what 's happened ! ! 
but i ca n't can i ? 
what ... does it turn to ? 
often enough to keep the franchise . 
happy birthday . 
<person> <person> <person> is just a number to you . <person> , a public outcry , but a number . <number> more dead . 
gibarian said he thinks <person> should be destroyed . 
i do n't want to hear about miracles and god and all that ! we tried to murder someone to cover our asses ! 
diane , i 've loved you ever since i first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head . 
aaron , i 've never seen them like this -- i think <person> 's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to ... 
`` i come , anon -- but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee -- '' 
you knew which man ? 
tell me about it . 
oh , god . 
dorothy ! is she here ? 
we know you 're not stupid , ms. tramell . 
well , everybody says ... it 's just kind of dorky . i mean , have you ever seen a gymnast 's legs ? they 're like -- -- the mighty oak . it 's not a look . 
kill him . 
<person> , what is it ? 
i deny his every charge . 
with an unloaded pistol ? 
shocking abuse of authority . 
because i took some sleeping pills . but i 'm all right now -- so let 's go . 
is n't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on <person> <person> in the parking lot ? 
and my own . 
i like calling you <person> . 
i ca n't talk to anybody right now , ca n't you see i 'm busy ! i ca n't talk business . <person> up . have a drink . get her a whiskey . 
it 's my apartment . 
not yet . 
-- i hope you like <person> <person> -- 
you come up with a better plan , let me know . 
<number> of the reasons i love you , <person> , is that you 're almost as crazy as i am . please do n't set off anything that goes bang tonight , okay ? just bright colors . can you tell the difference ? 
no ... ... ... .i . 
do n't shoot ! you 'll hit <person> ! 
you will do as you please . it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other . do you not agree ? 
i kick myself sometimes , but the thing is , i would have been miserable living his life . 
next month is june . 
your whacked-out , bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom . i thought they were going to break my arm . 
... whaddo i do ? 
i ca n't blame anything on hal . it was me . i play it back in my mind everyday .

what boat you sailing on ? 
i 've tried calling and writing . i want to reach <person> .

... that the prey can bite back . 
you got no reason to do that ! 
she did n't say . but she says it 's urgent . 
if you 'll excuse me ... ... 
a guy who calls himself armitage . 
plan on a longer visit next time .

mary , i 'm a farmer -- always will be . to me seed is n't a thing to pay debts with , it 's alive , more alive than anything -- but i guess you 're right . we just got to do it . oh -- how 's it all going to end ? 
what ... <person> ... 
christ , what a night ! not even so much as a sign for <number> miles on that road ! 
you could say that . 
not very likely . 
hello , <person> <person> . how do you feel now ? 
look , can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this ? 
this is way too creepy . 
i bet they like him for his big charity balls . 
the movie 's about < u > purity < /u > . so we do n't < u > show < /u > her breasts . we show them to < u > him < /u > , her back to the camera . 
the scale ... it 's just ... so all the civilizations you detect ; they all end up coming here ? 
it turned out to be cancer . 
you 've made some mistake there with the bushes ... that 's why you ca n't finish it . 
how many opportunities are you going to get in your life ?

you know her , <person> ? 
is sunshine your real name ? 
then tell me , please -- help me ... ! 
it 's okay , really . 
the little brenner girl ? 
i read . 
yeah , great idea ! and i 'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job . 
i do n't know . it just happened . i was here <number> years ago , i 'm here now . that 's it . 
in the woods you said you had nothing . but you would n't , and i would n't if there 's some way you do n't have to go . please . at least not right away . 
the key , goddamit , the key ! 
yes , <person> ? 
i got <number> minutes . 
i 'm gettin ' tired of readin ' for a while . 
you still wake up sometimes , do n't you ? wake up in the dark , with the lambs screaming ? 
i know , but it keeps down the size of my can . 
okay . i just wanted you to know . 
so why did y ... 
i had 'em too . i burnt those <number> starky and hutch motherfuckers down . then their asses lucked out and found that coke . 
she understands . 
nothing . 
i would 've thought <person> <person> <person> would be more your line . 
your last chance . take the money . 
i hate you ! i ca n't trust anybody ! 
i called connie and she said not to worry , she 'll fill in for you . 
never in my twenty-four years , knock on wood . i 've only ever taken my gun out <number> times with the actual intention of using it . never fired it though . not once . you ? 
yes i can , <person> . and until you start givin ' me some straight answers : i 'm gon na assume that some mischief has been goin ' on here . 
on the square , <person> , if you 'd seen <person> down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup , but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ... 
but you would like to know where she is ? 
i know . it 's terrible ! 
the land is there . i know it ! 
we 'll be broke in <number> weeks . 
they say they 're going to pay my medical expenses and everything . i promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks , and we can pretend it never happened . 
oh , that . it 's from a friend of mine . a middle-aged lady , very foolish and very generous . 
when this whole thing started you made it clear : you 're running the show . and i do n't believe you 'd be running this show if you did n't know what was going on . 
of her acting , it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low ... have you got that , <person> <person> ? in the opinion of this reviewer - 
munro would . but general webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake . having let them go , i fear i will only fight the same men again when i move south . and yet , i can not break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of france ... 
guess i do n't . 
no . 
you mean ... and orgasm ? 
what did you see ? 
tell me what happened . 
where do i put ashore ? 
what do you mean , <person> ? 
that money is my whole future . 
alright , i was wrong . there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster . 
but the way you did it then sounded so phony . 
no , but i can never tell her that . 
we 're having a party for you , boy . cake and shish-k-bob , just like you love . <person> cringes away from the light . 
<person> , do you realize you do n't do comedy anymore ? where 's that sweet guy who used to do `` here i come to save the day ! '' ? please , enough with the wrestling ! you 've lost touch with reality ! 
you want to get ast to eat , hunh ? 
no offense , but why 'd they partner me with a rookie ? 
what do you do , <person> ? 
thank you very much , deputy minister . 
now wait a minute , you 're always so touchy about his plays , it is n't the part - it 's a great part . and a fine play . but not for me anymore - not a foursquare , upright , downright , forthright married lady . 
i 'm going with you . 
i know . you 're <person> . be right with you . 
mrs. langtry , i 'm sorry . 
how ? the bridge is gone . 
what are you doing ? 
why ? 
when you ran off , i thought you 'd keep going 'til you were back home in washington . 
okay ... we got it together ... . 
well , it was just an idea -- i hate to see a ticket go to waste -- 
no , why ? 
if you lose , then that hot little porsche of yours is mine . 
i 'm sure . where is everyone ? 
jesus i 've got - to get to the ho -- 
your phone number ? 
wow . 
then what 'll you do ? 
you can trust me on this <number> . 
you 're not yet <number> months , are you ? 
even <person> ? 
you know what gets me ? 
it was <person> <person> 's op . the guy was going to sell-out a mole or something . i have n't been debriefed on exactly what it was . 
<number> last time . give me the box . 
<number> <number> and fifty <number> dollars is a lot of money . that must have made you pretty angry ? 
the police are waiting outside . they 're going to take you somewhere safe . 
no . i 'm quite certain you ca n't . 
do n't go , <person> ... 
you 're not stupid . 
it 's got ta stay purple . all night . <person> <person> , how ya doin ' ? 
s'matter with you ? you look like you 're fading . 
i do not know him , but i have seen him . 
go on . 
smack him back . 
we should act out our inner most fantasies . 
okay ? 
of which we have more than enough . 
going to make a little stop back home , pick up my shirts , show him a little treat . 
mother ! 
what 's my name ? 
i 'd given you up . 
they 'll come around . close your eyes , i wan na bring out the gorgeous color in them . the first rule in applying eye makeup , is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow . 
that 's right . 
i think you 've just escaped for the moment . just as i did . as <person> did . as they let us do . but only for the moment . 
max . you threw my briefcase in the river . you 've got balls bigger than <person> . 
yes , sir . <person> . but it is eighty dollars the portion . 
told ya , did n't i ? 
we 're just feeling our way back . 
i love you when you 're angry . 
thank you , spearchucker . i 'll certainly take a look at these . where the hell did you ever get that name ? 
blaine , if i knew who it was that person would n't be alive right now . 
did n't seem worried about them . 
languages . i was already fluent in <number> languages . 
... his majesty was quite keen that you should understand -- 
i have to disturb you when you 're cooking the books , but there 's a delivery . 
do n't let him kid you . <person> could n't have pulled a sweeter job . all right , boys . we were waiting in the depot in frankfurt , see ? and there was an ammunition train coming through , the longest ammunition train you ever saw , see ? so <person> gets himself in the men 's room , see ? fixes himself a time bomb , busts open the window and just as the train moves out , lays the thing in there , see ? so then , he comes out like nothing 's happened and <number> minutes later you can hear it -- boom ! <person> every window in frankfurt . it was gorgeous ! 
hishradyo . 
<number> whips . to go . 
i do n't know , <person> . i 'm a fire fighter . this is ... this is different . 
<person> leland , why did n't you go to europe with him ? he wanted you to . he said to me just yesterday - 
huh ? 
how long you had these guys ? 
well , i 'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you . 
you 're not going to bet it all ... . 
hello ? it 's just me and you again . 
admiration ? my my . 
also , could you remember to use the service entrance at all times ? 
you are not gon na believe this , evelyn ! absolutely fantastic ! i 'm on my way -- 
yes , with these suits . we 've used them before on atomic tests ... odd- looking , are n't they ? 
i do n't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket . my deal with <person> was subject to a successful boot scan . obviously it did n't pass muster . <person> 's off . 
then tell me what a king is ! is he a man who believes only what others believe ? is he <number> who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart ? there is strength in you . i see it . i know it . 
it might be best if we did n't talk . 
do you really want to buy those cigarettes ? 
what 's your problem with <person> <person> ? 
i do n't know . i thought i did . now i 'm not sure . i thought it had something to do with me . 
first time in a grav couch ? 
just leave me alone . 
what the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night ? i thought we had a deal ? 
yeah , got to do something about you . 
and then <person> , you and i clean up whatever 's left to be cleaned . 
oh yeah , i 'm really gon na eat carbohydrates ... 
buddy , quit that , you 're just a child , you 're not supposed to be interested in such things . 
yeah , well , i 've stopped all that now . 
no , no ! the runner on second goes to third ! he 's out there ! 
i do n't . no exactly . 
who 'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes ? 
where are you off to young lady ? 
well , what do you feel like doing tonight ? 
bud , your sister 's a little older now and she 's naturally going to start going out with boys . ... in fact pretty soon -- she 's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here . that 's if she can learn to bake . 
it 's still there , jake . even if you never say a word about it . you ca n't spend <number> years in vietnam ... 
i do n't know what we 're talking about . 
do you know what 's in this archive ? 
i 'm not open . we were just talking . 
have you ? 
i do n't understand a <number> of you . what 's the matter with you ? it 's your men back there ! we got plenty a ' room for more . 
i would like to say goodbye . 
well , i 'm back now . i just wanted you to know . got ta rush . 
why did he ask if it was frozen ? 
yeah . come on . 
well , i hope he 's not watching me all the time . 
fool , there 's a lot in this world you do n't know . 
i would have tried to show her a good time . i promised her when she left that i would never forget her and i never did . <person> <person> does not forget . 
so , what 's our first plan of attack <person> ? 
and what 's <person> 's status ? 
we have , have we ? 
with <person> , eh ? 
i did n't trust her . all that blood on the sheets . she may look sweet , but she could be a wolf in sheep 's clothing . something 's weird . 
kind of . 
you think ? 
i am , <person> ... sergeant <person> <person> . 
it 's the middle of the night , sweetie . 
you 're looking fine , major . 
you never did . you did all the talking for both of us , remember ? 
probably was a couple of <number> years ago when whoever drew the map came through here . worn down to nothing now . 
and another thing , you better stay away from my sister or you better ... 
what , you 're seeing down to my nose ? my chin ? 
sean -- 
so tell me , what happened between you and the emperor ? what really happened on the german front ? you know the senate 's arguing your case ... 
-- the stained glass -- 
you ... you do n't know me -- 
why not you -- jean d'aulon ? the only man who 's poorer than i am , and so the only man i can trust . <person> , honorable , wise ... what more could we ask of a king ? 

have you succeeded in your task ? 
harder ... 
sun ... 
even if i knew i would n't tell you . you do not want to come into contact with these people . only carl knows who they are . that 's his real asset . <person> does n't know them . they do n't know <person> . <person> and state . 
your report 's become our bible down here , dr. <person> . we 've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- <number> by <number> -- to the smallest detail . 
yes . 
where have you been ? why did n't you come to see me ? 
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem : 'press the button , pull the chain , out comes a chocolate choo-choo train . ' 
i 'm a file clerk - <person> <person> and grain . 
cat , you tie onto this manifold . there 's some tanks on the other side ; i 'm gon na go check them out . 
busted firing pin . you want only the legal stuff right ? 
<person> <number> -- say intentions . 
yes mother . 
be careful ... . 
nope . 
i 'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin ' their ass in public , when their bitches get 'em home , they chill the fuck out . 
these will be very useful . at least we wo n't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands . all right , here 's the battle plan : we 're going to break into <number> teams and start systematically covering the ship . whoever finds it first , catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock . clear ? 
you 'll learn . 
<number> minutes , thirty seconds . 
you know , to make the legs move -- 
tis not the sword that counts , but the man what swings it . <person> easy , <person> . 
no sir ... 
okay , number <number> 's full . 
<person> butt-head , is n't there supposed to be like , water in cactuses ? 
... and she 's looking to me for support . and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level . 
why not ? you gave job a hundred and twenty <number> thousand . 
oh , yah , but there 's not a heckuva lot to discuss . what about you , <person> ? are you married - you have kids ? 
hey . 
year ago , i come in here on credit card fraud , but after i shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day , my dunn & broadstreet , has gone way the fuck up . 
please do n't do this to me . 
so uh , if you were a plastic surgeon before ... 
i 'm sorry . i hated to take your money , but -- 
yeah <person> , her assistant ... 
whoa , whoa , what are you doing ? i want to know what 's in here . 
he thinks it 's very cold to be sleeping outside . 
what was her major ? 
no , that was leavenworth . this -- was <person> <person> . what ya want ? 
if i talk to you ... y'know ... if i tell you things ... then you 're a lawyer , right ? you ca n't say things , you ca n't tell anyone , it 's like the privelage , right ? attornery-client , you understand ? 
you do n't have anything on me . a misdee auto-theft . i got no record . i 'll be out in <number> days , and back at it . or you let them go , and i give you my word . i 'm gone . and without the ringleader ... your tee-times have just grown exponentially ... 
oh , heavens - i must say , yes . 
fish are all over the water ... come on , let us take a boat out . 
you talked to <person> ? 
looks like you 'd make a good runner . 
i was just thinking ... there 's something special i want to talk to you about . i think it 's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship . a deeper level . 
i shall wear it in my hair ! 
i 'm not gon na tell him nothing ; but if he finds out , he will kill you . what 's the matter with you ? are n't you happy ? you got everything you want . 
bang , bang . you 're dead . 
listen . no one has ever escaped from <person> <person> . 
what makes you think you can ? 
the glib , cavalier routine , it really is an act , is n't it ? 
no . i 'm not . 
do n't let them hurt you . 
do n't cry , mama . this place ai n't so bad as it looks . sure , we work hard , but there 's plenty fresh air and sunshine ... and you know something else , i 've taken to going to church regular . they got services every sunday right there in the mess hall . 
but <person> always puts out that light -- 
it 's as simple as that . you 've been on our ward <number> hours and have already simplified the work of freud , <person> and <person> <person> in <number> grand analogy : it 's a pecking party . 
why are you a fuck ? 'cause you got talent . i got brains . but you got talent ! you 're god damn left arm is worth a <number> dollars a year . all my limbs put together are worth <number> cents a pound -- and that 's for science and dog meat . 
home . 
<person> -- 
no , i think you were . come on , admit it . 
it 's just not working like this . we got ta do something . it 'd be <number> thing if these girls were hardened criminals , but <person> , <person> , this is makin ' us look bad . i do n't know ... maybe they 're not movin ' . maybe that little creep lied . 
i am not involved . keep clicking your little wires . you 'll get someone else . good luck . 
fine . 
can i look at the pictures ? 
... how come do you reckon the coyotes ai n't been at 'em ? 
<person> <person> <person> , it 's me , <person> <person> . 
her heart . 
but what can you do ? there 's no way now . . . 
we have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps . please do n't , do n't discuss ... 
no ! do n't believe him . 
get close enough to a man and you can kill him on `` stun '' without setting off the alarm - of course you ca n't get rid of the body ... 
not at all . 
how are you , <person> ? 
are we keeping secrets from each other , little lad ? 
the turkey in ? 
your stomach ? 
i do n't know what 's wrong with that kid . 
all night ? 
and that will be a good place to end this study . 
we rented a loft in sunnyvale . you know what 's the bad part ? we ca n't talk about work anymore . we 're competitors ! the venture capitalists made us sign like <number> confidentiality forms . 
no . 
no -- now . 
heather chandler is <number> bitch that deserves to die . 
is that true ? 
you say you have n't seen your son since the day before yesterday ? 
yes . 
case . 
in this there is a chance . if i live , i can try to free you . if we do n't go , there is no powder , there 's too many of them . though my heart would keep me here , in that there is no chance . none . i can do nothing . do you understand ? 
yeah ... 
<number> ... ..i 'm sorry ... . 
<number> years . 
no ! ... 
what 're you ... ? where 's <person> ? where are the boys ? 
<number> . 
do n't go . 
yeah ? 
he ca n't abide a woman in trousers . he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature . 
all i know is that they 've got to fire a large number of people ... and they 're not going by seniority . there 's a recklessness in the air . they ... 
hey . 
of course . is it , am i a terrible coward to ask how much water we have ? 
how do you open the damn door ? 
i ca n't really go into it right now . i 'll just tell you it 's someone big . 
to us . to the mask . 
it 's what <person> and <person> injected into <number> of their victims . 
no more than <number> . for a cold drink . 
maybe some of the discomfort you 're feeling is ... guilt . <person> . over the innocent people you 've killed . 
that 's where he 's being clever . acting nonchalant . 
no . i 'll do them later . 
i knew i left these somewhere . <number> of these 'll send your kids to college someday . here – i made this for you . 
if you told him so , he 'd give me the part . he said he would . 
i 'll have some of that . 
what 's it look like to you ? 
what do you mean ? 
jennifer , there is more to life than work . 
<number> : `` we want freedom . we want the power to determine the destiny of our <person> <person> . '' <number> : `` we want full employment for our people . '' <number> : `` we want to end the robbery by the white man of our <person> <person> . '' <person> , they 're asking for reparations ... 
fine ... i want to talk to you . 
it 's a twenty . 
nothing . why are you doing this ? i thought <person> did n't exist . 
kevin , i 'm telling you ... it was like nothing i 've ... 
the closest i was able to get you was <person> <person> ... 
i do bite my thumb , sir ! 
mama . i been thinkin ' about her . she 's prob'ly worried to death by now . 
you have to ! quickly ! 
doug ? 
hi . so far so good . so . what should we talk about ? how insecure we were in high school . <person> <person> , the first girl i ever felt up . <person> . what about health ? did you know that eating <number> macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak ? 
well , we wo n't . 
so you do n't have to play innocent with me . he used to tell his wife that i was the branch manager from seattle -- <number> years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding . 
be <number> with the horse . 
not ... gray . 
you have a weakness for <person> <person> . 
yes . 
marvin , i need you to hold on . there 's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away . 
you seem to know what you ’ re talking about . 
are you better now ? 
should we wake him up ? 
your `` <person> <person> '' turned out to be more hospitable than i expected . 
& lt ; & lt ; <person> <person> . <person> <person> . i 've seen his face . i see it when i close my eyes. & gt ; & gt ; 
you mean <person> <person> ? 
it has . but you 'd be surprised . they understand -- they really do . it 's not the workers you have to worry about . 
and what is that ? 
i think we 're making some of the locals jealous . 
i have to go . 
a what ? 
ever stationed at kennedy ? those florida chicks ... 
nobody thought we 'd do this . nobody really thinks it 's going to work , do they ? 
do you understand me you little fuck ? 
i 'm here , <person> , how 's the <person> ? 
we had a description of the suspect . 
no . what is happening ? 
hello . would you like to join me , quince and <person> for a nightcap ? 
get the fuck outta here ! 
yes , sir . 
around . 
mmm ... 
she told me i have to . 
yes . 
[ i do n't know , i swear . ] 
so you 're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter . 
well , bye . she laughs and backs up slowly toward the door . 
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you -- 
i know everything about you , <person> . 
what are they saying ? 
exactly . exactly ! that 's exactly my feeling about it . it 's hard to know . like , okay , but how many times do i think something and it does n't happen ? that 's what you 're saying , right ? you forget about those times . <person> ? 
i believe that decision rests with <person> <person> . 
and ? 
i hear this michael fellow is schizophrenic . 
no , <person> , you said the first part . i said all the rest . 
then you acted properly , of course . 
find out who they are ? 
better person than i . 
<person> told me she met him at the beach . <person> blinded by his smile . you believe that shit ? son of a bitch never smiled at me . buried her at a `` private '' service . private for who . <person> ? 
quite frankly , we do n't know much about it except that it 's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient 's delusion that his body 's been invaded by an alien intellegence ; a spirit if you will . 
i did this already . 
you 're getting farther away all the time . it 's a duck . 
i did n't know he had a wine cellar . 
is n't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor 's cap with the name of the yacht ? 
oh , all right . there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york . it was full of men from the united nations . 
<person> <person> -- 
hello ! 
you want the stuff tomorrow or do n't ya ? it 's gon na take hours just to clean it up . besides , <person> 's still a hot item . where am i gon na be if he gets hit ? 
do you pack a gat ? [ <number> ] a close view of the two shows the smile dying on <person> 's face . he looks up quickly . 
if that 's not a drop or a pickup , i 'll open a charge for you at bloomingdale 's . 
that 's true . you grow up here ? 
power yoga ? 
you mean , like , `` he has the cutest butt '' ? where did i hear that recently ? 
you 're coming with me , you great white dope ! to die , way down in the sewer ! 
`` it was big 'n brown <number> kept goin ' an ' goin ' as far you could see . '' 
where are we going ? i 'm going to buy you <number> lunch -- did n't <person> tell you ? 
i do n't buy that . 
i 'm sorry ... about what i said . it 's just that -- all those times you and <person> were trying for another kid , i ... i used to pray at night that it would work . and not because of you guys or that i wanted a brother or sister ... but ... just so i would n't have to be ... 
<number> <number> ? 
maybe . but you 're not putting any shit in me this time . 
red light , green light , <person> ? 
i want to talk to you , <person> .

then i 'm afraid i do n't understand . 
i 'm tired , <person> . so tired . i have to rest a while . 
i 'm afraid i do n't understand . 
you might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag . ca n't guarantee that wo n't happen , especially with a new gun . i may have to shoot it .

i did n't want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry .

when did he say it , norma ? 
this is business . there was an accident in maine , some guy got killed by something in a lake . probably a bear , but ... they found a tooth . 
who is this . . . <person> ? 
you want control of the crowd -- you ca n't get it by killing their hero . 
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle . 
is something wrong ? what 's happened to your face ? 
they were for me . they 're mine . 
what about that psychic , what 's his name , <person> ? 
in detroit . this weekend . 
but i do have a theory ... 
hey , i 'm the flavour of the month ! 
fifteen dollars . 
i do n't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick . i make an honest living . 
the kitchen .

no . i do n't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone ' ... 
she 's in the desert . she 's out in the desert . 
but i must tell him -- he must know of it . please -- tell me where he is . 
<person> arbor is n't ... that far from cleveland , right ? 
who said so ? 
look , whatever you want me to do , i 'll do . i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up , okay ? 
what ? 
... i was right about what ? 
all our `` favorite '' people were there saying all their `` favorite '' things about their `` favorite '' subjects . i thought to myself , we 've been friends with these people almost <number> years and nobody knows anybody . we 're so afraid we wo n't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with . 
i love this . we 're onto something really big . i can smell it , <person> . we 're going to make some headlines with this <number> . 
what the fuck did you do to my trunk ? 
i did n't expect anyone . 
it 's good to see you . i 'm sure you 're curious about what i 've been doing . 
you 're slowing . 
how do you know <person> <person> saw my reports ? 
do n't you live at home ? 
oh , yeah ! 
that kid is <number> horny retard . 
of course , you could return with us . our society might find a place for you and your mate . 
you got a school teacher or nancy from accounting , you do n't put on <person> <person> or <person> <person> . you put on ravel . rachmaninoff . but if you got some wild <number> you just picked up at the track , you would n't put on cat stevens or <person> <person> . you 'd put on prince . or <person> <person> . or , if you really wanted to get after it : miles . 
yes , that is correct . 
he wants to set me up in a place , give me some money . 
the peace conference . 
<person> hughes , he would just kill us . hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved . 
nothing ... halfdan the black chopped his hand off last night . 
she is not there . the coffin is gone . 
it 's okay with me . i 'm not arguing . 
got it . 
count 'em on <number> hand . 
holy shit . 
what 's <person> up to ? ... will they join us , or fire on us ... ? <person> , break radio silence . send my compliments to captain esteban . 
drew ! 
it 's the wicked witch ! what 'll we do ? help ! help ! 
which is guy-speak for ... 
huh ! who do you think we are , mr <person> ? 
art . 
you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here . 
no , good sisters are rare . we need every <number> . tell me something : how tall are you ? 
ugh ... you guys , seriously ... i 'm having <person> <person> withdrawal ... 
<person> ? you know he and jake are ... 
why do you say that ? 
i 'm going to change for dinner . i 'll see you shortly . 
well , yeah i did , but i spent most of my time occupying various , um , administration buildings -- 
i do . 
<person> . it 's just ... a strange woman waltzes into my office today . tells me she murdered her parents and can prove satan exists . 
what else do we do ? ! 
no . thanks . she starts to move away , then stops and looks back . 
<number> or <number> . and they go wild ? 
what the hell 's his problem ? 
how are you , baby ? 
open it . 
yes . 
i got ta headache ... what 's goin ' on ? 
all right , tycoons , let 's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand . 
so there never was a death squad . 
yeah-well , you wanted to keep the relationship flexible , remember ? it 's your phrase . 
no ... we 're together ... 
bullshit . you would 've killed us anyway . 
they look nice , i agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility , are n't they ? i might get laughed at . how much do you want for these muskets ? 
maybe it 's supposed to be funny . 
but you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet 
then just wait -- maybe this whoever 's got you next on the asylum 's equipment- test list . maybe a literal mind-blow inside the `` saturation chamber . '' 
you may be right . 
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization . 
what 'd you do , honey ? 
hello , <person> . 
say it again . 
she needs help . 
<person> ! 
geez , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile . 
well , maybe i am laughing a bit ... i just thought , as long as you 're here , it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little . 
the mondrian , room <number> . the number is <number> <number> , plus the l.a. code ... 
alright . but why , if <person> is so clean in all this , did n't he cancel <person> <person> ? 
christ , it 's oil of tansy ! 
no , it 's coming . 
how ya doin ' , <person> . staying comfortable ? 
<person> , this is <person> . the intakes are clogged with dust . we overheated and burned out a whole cell . 
oh , that 's rich -- coming from her lapdog -- 
`` sink the putt . '' 
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word ? when he put me in that trance ... 
okay , but if you do i 'll have to perform resuscitation -- 
okay . <person> , i 'll do it . but i have a few terms . 
what ? 
i guess not . 
i 'd say you 're moving . 
stop it , <person> ! 
what ? a genius ? . . . an inspiration ? 
ah , the staff meeting could have gone better . 
for what ? 
yeah . 
do n't you watch the news ? 
okay . 
and in a theater full of empty seats , why did you sit by me ? 
pretty country . 
she 's getting undressed . 
they own the information he 's disclosing . the truer it is , the greater the damage to them . if he lied , he did n't disclose their information . and the damages are smaller . 
i do n't want his money . 
beats me . look , jackie-boy , a friend of mine just sold some reefer to <person> <person> . he 's tripping the light fantastic with <person> <person> at <number> maravilla , <person> <person> . it 's right around the corner . 
the drugstore ? 
not without a warrant . 
if you 're deaf , read my lips ... i do n't need a psycho following me today . 
i love you , too . 
it was n't much more than a pot boiler.suez was very important for our generation . i did n't want it to be forgotten . and that 's why i 'd like to be able to help you . but really <person> <person> , i looked through my notes before you came , they 're all very much out of date , there 's been so much published since . i do n't think i 'm your man . 
well what ? 
i ’ m afraid they are out at the moment , sir . 
purgatory ... fashioned by the hands of men . twisted , lost souls , the worst of the criminally insane , were locked away in here like animals . 
you mean it has hyperdrive ? 
anyway , even <person> seemed perplexed by his intransigence . if i did n't know better , i 'd swear <person> had some personal investment in my ruination . 
believe me , i 'm on your side . 
do i hear a motion seconded ? 
for a fee . 
that 's easy ! 
naturally . 
i do n't see where that 's any of your business . 
vinkel ... you 've got quite a collection of er-collection . 
what is it you intend to do to me ? 
he 's hardly my <person> <person> . 
try less appropriate . 
and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you . let him think it was his fault ... he should be along very shortly .. . but be very stern before you forgive him , especially if it is your fault ... while you 're waiting for your friend , would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs ? 
you do n't understand . you have been chosen . 
fine . nowt wrong with them . 
and what ? 
sera you are crazy . 
yes -- of course . 
watch it , <person> ! 
i 'm paying you to give cello lessons . not to pervert my child . 
well , we did n't have a camera ... so she just wrote the date on the bag and said , & quot ; this will be out wedding album , this will be a day we will never forget. & quot ; we never did . 
it 's all better left unsaid , <person> . 
this is the best movie i 've ever seen in my life . 
no alcohol ? 
her name was right there in front of them . they gave it to me , i did n't give it to them . 
eight-hundred , split down the middle . tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits . 
oh shit ! no ! <person> , do n't let them take me back there ! 
what are you thinking about ? 
throw a gray scale on it ; standard interpolation . 
yes , <person> . but this -- creature is a special case . 
it 's all right . he stays with me all the time . 
there you go . grain of salt . <number> sides to every coin . 
i put you away -- 
you do n't believe me . 
conrad has the phone number . <person> , where is he ? 
what about the will ? 
no , what you said before , could i make it in metropolis ? i 've dreamed about it , sure , but i never really thought about it . what would i do when i got there ? 
wake up ! 
i saw you come in , talk on the phone . get undressed . 
well , what about the positive control , the safety catch ? do n't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order ? 
is she home ? 
no , his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt . <person> . 
i know -- and you could show me the door . you would , too , if you were n't still hoping the guests might arrive . 
they do n't hate you -- 
i 'm crucifying him . 
tell me . when you get to the altar , will you spike the bouquet ? 
which is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin ' all over you like flies .

his blood ... on the floor ... it brought me back . 
here 's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest , go into a church or railroad station -- but do n't go into nobody 's house , you hear me ? 
okay , colonel . but look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . maybe that works , huh ? maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ? 
of course , elaine . but as long as there 's any question , better <person> should come back and clear his name . 
i got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
now what ? 
like the claw . 
i still do n't know what that means .

fine , no tunnel . are you still with me ? hello ? 
<person> mrs spitz ... i don ’ t know to whom i ’ m indebted for the recommendation but ... i ’ m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references . what i do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not i can be of help . i hope you can appreciate that , <person> <person> .

i followed <person> <person> -- right after you left -- and , gee , <person> , where do you think he went ? right into the space ship ! 
oh , for <person> 's sake , kramer . you have got to be the world 's most naive human being . <person> has gone in and changed every single ad you 've done on the entire fire and ice campaign . every layout ... every idea ... every single thing , right down the line .

no , but i have to admit i thought about it . 
did you see her ? 
oh yes , i saw . <person> child . 
if we hurry , we can still catch the sandra bullock movie . 
i 've got a story for you . you know the joan gale girl ? 
eat your heart out . is <person> there ? 
now i want you to change your clothes , <person> . we 're going to take a walk outside . 
hi , i'm-i 'm <person> <person> . 
allow me , comrade . 
why ? 
oh . that . <person> . 
i was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing . 
yes , do n't worry . 
i was talking with someone ! 
stick with me on this gloria . i need you ... 
i mean bad . 
around . 
ouch . 
see anything interesting ? 
i 'm with <person> <person> and she 's floating <number> feet off the bed . 
yeah , when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard . it scared the shit outta me . sure you 're okay ? 
now are you threatening me , dick ? 
the only arrangement i 'll accept is full investment . <person> . the whole <number> units . i know that you 're saying 'be safe , ' i know what you 're saying . i know if i left you to yourselves , you 'd say 'come back tomorrow , ' and when i walked out that door , you 'd make a cup of coffee ... you 'd sit down ... and you 'd think 'let 's be safe ... ' and not to disappoint me you 'd go <number> unit or maybe <number> , because you 'd become scared because you 'd met possibility . but this wo n't do , and that 's not the subject ... '' listen to this , i actually said this . `` that 's not the subject of our evening together . '' now i handed them the pen . i held it in my hand . i turned the contract , <number> units eighty-two grand . `` now i want you to sign . '' i sat there . <number> minutes . then , i sat there , <person> , twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock . twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock . not a word , not a motion . what am i thinking ? `` my arm 's getting tired ? '' no . i did it . i did it . like in the old says , <person> . like i was taught ... like , like , like i used to do ... i did it . 
i used you as a diversion . while you were getting captured upstairs , i was shredding documents in the basement . <person> down , i guess i was just jealous . you were <number> incredible thief ... 
how dare you ? my father is the british museum 's most respected archeologist ! 
what 'd you say , <person> ? 
this is n't happening ... 
where did you get this ? 
what ? 
he 's got a new place at burnham . 
you must leave ? 
they may be scum , but if i get the da vinci model back , then we 'll be roasting weenies on the beach . 
they got ta be . 
you 're with interpol -- you 're a cop . 
no way ! 
yo ! 
do you remember what we talked about ? 
i could 've saved them . 
do you keep in touch with them ? 
have you had <number> ? 
i 'm close ... but i ca n't get who it is ... 
your cumma ? what are you doin ' with your cumma ? 
no . i was just curious if what i heard about you is true ? 
this morning . 
yes . i want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody . 
i 'm sorry , i do n't mean to be impolite . because , you know , you ca n't understand . 
a bullshit president ! i do n't see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs . where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by <person> 's communist buddies - all these damned peace treaties ! i 'm telling ya <person> , that 's what happens when you let the niggers vote . they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart . 
... i was wondering what 's such dynamite in this bay of pigs story ? ... although it was clearly effective , because all of a sudden it was no problem for <person> to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate . 
we 're quoting <person> again . 
easy . we 're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before . some kind of animals . real fast , volatile , predators . <number> went through <number> of your patrons like they were <person> . 
-- but just as a kind of safety tip . 
why not ? 
i might have to show him some material that could stimulate him . 
shhh ! liar . 
may i be quite frank with you ? 
the presidency . the public loves him . 
you want to go talk to him ? 
where 's star , <person> ? ! 
man , it 's a long story . i met d'wana <number> months ago . she had a little pudge in her stomach but i did n't pay it no attention . come to find out , she <number> months pregnant . saying i 'm the daddy ! 
yeah , i 'm interested , but can we get someplace a little less public ? 
`` unlock my button '' ... ? 
had it with deals . 
are they nice ? 
it ai n't even <number> years we been married . 
how long can i afford to stay closed ? 
i have just come from the palace . the post has been filled . 
he 's going to be a fireman . 
well you know his blokes 'll place the oscor in his annex , where else if you 're pinpointing transmitters , video signals , covert chip cameras , anything radiating , oscillating.. 
something 's going on here . you 're not telling me something . what the hell 's gotten into you ? 
why ? 
i 'm only a student . 
you know i want to ... 
ikset-kiba . me imanetaba oum dalat ! 
you did n't not see me long enough to miss me . 
not exactly . as i said , this is some kind of- 
twenty-six months . 
... an attempt at humor , i suppose . 
oh yeah , that 'll definitely happen ... 
probably best not tell anyone about this . 
umm , where do you want this ? 
i will . can my assistant come , too ? 
what about him ? 
the killer was trying to get to her . that sorority girl was a distraction . 
your life ? 
is he leaving right this minute ? 
i was thinking that ... maybe when this is all over we could ... 
yeah , i did . [ <person> ] he was my most memorable patient . 
i 'm still in the chair , lieutenant . 
i could do it if i tried . even <person> thinks so . 
you do n't want to talk about it . 
and again . how would you get him on land ? 
... how are the kids getting along ? 
the stewardess . do you know her last name ? 
just like always ! just like it always was ! right , <person> ? am i right ? 
look , kid , gim me a break . i 'm an old man . i 'm runnin ' on a delrin aorta . i 'm finished - dead from my ankles up . 
i think i can handle that <number> . 
move a finger , <person> , and you 're history ... 
i 'm frightened and confused and i ... i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and ... and concrete and ... 
but what becomes of our souls ? 
detective , does it look like a murder ? 
next time , bet with your own kind . 
that 's your past . i want to talk about your future . would you be willing to do something for me ? 
need some help , honey . 
no , just not the type . 
i am <person> . 
what do we do ? 
listen , i should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him , you know that . i do n't need this aggravation . i 'm getting old . 
no -- why should i ? 
i guess i can only make you believe the things you want to be true , huh ? like ol' * jimmy down there . 
oh -- here you are , <person> . a drink -- a louisiana flip ? 
a g ... g ... g ... 
<person> ! 
he belongs to <person> . 
... that 's all well and good , captain , save for <number> thing : there 's no gold down there . 
who the hell knows ? he dropped out of sight <number> years ago . 
do you think it 's wide enough ? how much ? 
professor , is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something ? 
sure . 
what ? 
sure , like this low-grade shit here , some girl in a fight with her boyfriend ... it 's a test-pattern . nothing happens . i 'm snorin ' . 
of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living . 
and you were drilling these holes ... ? 
aiiee . more waiting ? i do n't know if i like this plan . 
they must work on the section gang . 
oh , shit . come on , old ... 
seriously . 
so what firm you with , pal ? 
i was n't going to say -- 
you said the guy down here is good . 
what 's with the cameras ? 
thank you . 
do n't worry . it 's a test . 
i 'm gettin ' angry askin ' the same question a second time . where did they go ? 
did you see the papers today ? 
if you keep doing that , you 're going to bump your head , sissy . give my love to mama- tell her i 'll see her thursday . 
i have n't really thought about it . 
come on , do n't bullshit me . 
trip ? what do you mean , <person> ? you said you 'd be -- 
hell yeah ! i 'll even spot ya a few points first game . 
is that an insult ? are you insulting me . 
guess i 'm not used to so much . 
it 's her . this is the woman who i 've seen . 
no word since beam-in . we can only wait for their call . 
gus , tell me , have you ever heard of vulcan ? 
only now i 'm starting to think the car was n't exactly <person> 's to give . 
i 'm the one who watched the show ... i was ... 
do you miss it ? you seem like you do . 
but the child -- 
sarah , tonight why do n't you and hal come over for dinner ? 
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker . 
<person> v. l. <person> . i knew it . he 's a scientist all right . inventor of the pemberton condensed <person> <person> . i 'm telling you , <person> , loveless is our man . 
why do n't you just stick your finger in and stir it up . 
hmmm . 
you are a fanatic . an anarchist . you know that ? if we ca n't have a whole show , then i want half a show rather than no show . but oh , no , not you . you wo n't be satisfied unless you 're putting the company at risk ! 
yes , sir . very good , sir . 
when was i in here ? 
can i stay , sir ? i 'm willing to risk it . i am . after what we just witnessed . 
'it 's up to <person> ' ? those were his words ? 
but , you do come from a military family ? 
i 'm so close i can feel it . 
you 're a cop ... you 're a fucking cop ... i should kill you . 
so . i receive <number> per cent just for finance and legal protection . no worries about operations , is that what you tell me ? 
a man 's attitude ... a man 's attitude goes some ways toward how a man 's life will be . is that somethin ' you agree with ? 
do you want me to save you ? do you want me to save you ? 
you and everybody else . god i hate this area . <person> me nervous . 
he 's drunk . 
i want my car . 
<person> : gim me a cuesta-ray . 
what the fuck was that about ? 
it looks like a tablecloth . 
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end . you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him , too . 
he was an m.p . in bangkok back in '21 . <person> some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in berne . then , last september ... surprise , surprise ... he just seemed to disappear . 
what 's that ? 
what ? 
<person> ! come with us . 
enigma . 
did you get it ? 
funny . would you like to buy me a drink ? 
i , uh ... i got it stuck . 
it 's okay by me , peanut . 
dr. lester , it 's been really fascinating , but i 'm afraid i have to get home to my wife now . 
now take deep breaths , and push . 
i was quite enjoying that . 
what 's wrong ? 
yes . 
tell my dad i 'm sorry about the watch . 
how does it sound ? 
that was <number> hours ago ! who sent you ? did they send you here ? 
any time it 's saturday and i do n't hafta do any work , i 'm doin ' okay ! 
follow him ! 
ah ! ah ! ahmenophus ! 
they pressurize us with helium . 
`` heroes for <person> '' ? 
just sit there and soak up the vitamin d . 
you did basic here ? 
wow ! 
aw , ai n't you glad to see me , bandit ? 
you have not slept with your husband for <number> years ? 
never mind . i want a tent . 
now take that guilty look off your face , <person> -- and stop trembling like a horse . 
actually , thirty-five is probably more accurate . 
what ? 
i 'm taking my next book to viking . 
i can call them ... i can call my dad . 
name dropper . 
<person> ... 
mine . 
you should be . can i meet this friend of yours ? 
did n't go as planned ? it was a catastrophe . you ruined the lives of <number> people -- 
what does it mean , indy ? 
jesus . 
that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois . 
'cause you 're goin ' to america ! ! full house boys ! 
i want my fucking money -- 
copy . 
what ? 
oh . my . god . i ca n't believe you 're here . welcome . can i just tell you , i am so excited right now . 
hi . <person> and <person> ? 
yes , i see . about those lovebirds , miss ... 
argyle . do n't you take this stuff ? 
<person> ? 
it 's not healthy with it closed . 
listen , i 'm crazy about the guy -- he 's smart , he 's aggressive , he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it . 
huh ? whadda you mean ? 
i want to finish what i started . i want to finish the game . 
oh , i could kill him ! i mean really kill him . i actually threw the entire opera on the fire , he made me so angry ! 
what is it , the kicks ? is that it ? 
there 's only <number> person in the world to decide what i 'm going to do - and that 's me . and if you think - if any of you think - 
get out of here , jake . 
sustained . <person> <person> , do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case ? 
what do you think ? 
you know , that is my worst fear . making a sound and no <number> hears it . 
where 'd they go ? 
try it . 
what for ? 
myself and mr . pink ? 
me ? no , no . i-i could n't make it that ni- my-my raccoon had hepatitis . 
oh , i ... have those too . what kind of problems does your dad have ? 
lot of pressure at the star . <person> , when we got married , you were <number> <number> dollars in debt ; when we split , you were solvent . that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life , and now look at this . how much did the damn bike cost ? 
i 'm looking for a record for my daughter . for her birthday . `` i just called to say i love you . '' do you have it ? 
you gon na bust my horns , or you want spaghetti 
that 's what gives me the fear . 
and , you , my dear wife , do you find that i resemble my portraits ? 
yeah ... see ya in my dreams , huh ? 
sloan is the hardest working person i 've ever met . 
mrs. <person> , do n't wreck it . i 'm asking you please not to wreck it . 
something funny , <person> ? 
i 'm all wet . 
it 's a fine line between insane and inspired . 
where is this broad ? 
about what ? 
seriously ? ! ? 
people think i 'm stepping out on neil . we 're causing quite a scandal . 
for work ... .. 
it 's a lovely outpost . 
... you have n't < u > found < /u > him yet . 
waddaya talking about ? ! ! 
maybe it 's not me . 
jesus . i got it working ... you have no idea how hard it was ... they 're finally a team ... 
do you ? 
jude , you okay ? 
hey , he should have a weapon , a knife or something . 
i do like you . but not when you act like a jerk . 
i think not . i have seen the lady . and if he did not leave her in marseilles , or in oran , he certainly wo n't leave her in casablanca . 
which <number> is that ? raw what ? 
no , that should be more than -- 
perfect dozen . 
mickey ? 
yeah . 
what call ? 
i think he 's hurt pretty bad . 
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . i kiss you all starryeyed , my body 's swinging from side to side . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you . 
do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with preysing ? 
no . i 'll wait here . 
it is n't safe for you to remain in this area . 
this looks like a job for <person> -- 
i only exchanged a few casual words with her , as <number> would ordinarily do on a public bus ... 
honey that song came out in <number> , when i was exactly your age . 
now there 's a girl who knows how to pour . what 's your name ? 
reiben , what 's the matter with you ? i do n't gripe to you . i 'm a captain . there 's a chain of command . griping goes <number> way , up , only up , never down . you gripe to me , i gripe to my superior officers . up , get it ? i do n't gripe to you , i do n't gripe in front of you . how long you been in the army ? 
nothing , thank you . nothing . i wanted to see you ... what 's <person> up to , <person> ? 
who knows . 
what the hell 's going on ! 
<person> murphy ? 
possibly . please just wait outside . 
effective . but to tell you the truth , i 've lost my passion for work . 
no thanks , <person> . 
then call me tomorrow . 
yes . 
actually it 's a nightmare . i 've been desperate for a shag , but watching him suffer was just too much fun . you should try it with <person> . 
yep . for the hose . but while you was gone i replaced a gasket . that 's going to run you another fifty . 
tish-i 'm tee . what 's that ? 
hey , business is business . you use a gun , i use a fountain pen , what 's the difference ? to put it in my terms , you 're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you did n't expect a poison pill was gon na be running around the building . hans , baby ... i 'm your white knight . 
the traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized <person> and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear . they got no case against us because there is no evidence against us . 
we studied all day yesterday . do n't tell me ... 
i ca n't remember . i 've got to make some money . 
hello , <person> ... 
yes , m'sieu . 
good morning , gentlemen . please be seated . i see we 're still dressing in the dark , eugene . 
it was at least as good as the sky . 
jesus , my-my grammy ... n-never gave gifts , you know . she-she was too busy getting raped by cossacks . 
he was . 
you got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be <number> miles down the river . 
that 's the influence of the right food , the right exercise , and the right breathing . greet the dawn with the breath of fire ! of course , there 's no doubt the body is giving out . i 'm well into autumn . i 'll have to be giving it all up after saturday . sweeten the tea with honey , <person> . it 's delicious . 
wannabee nigger ... 
dylan here . 
yah -- yah . everyone says this is a big accident ? she got iced because she wins everything , and this time someone did n't want her to win . 
have you noticed , <person> ? this fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you . it seems as though you might have modeled for the artist . 
so does half of san diego . 
you got nice tits . 
i was thinkin ' about asking for my <number> and fifty grand and calling it quits . 
we 'd be in the hole by now . hey , man , you 're peeing on my shoe . 
what else did she tell you ? 
what 'll happen to us , <person> ? 
i hate these southern shites . 
have a problem , call ford fairlane . he wo n't solve your case , but who cares , you 'll be dead in a couple days anyway . let 's face it . after today , the california raisins are n't gon na hire you . 
these are dangerous times . they want the <person> <person> to lead them . 
they say <person> has a license from <person> himself to work this neighborhood . 
what are you gon na do ? 
you lost someone . 
you psychic ? 
no luck ? 
let 's just try the first part . if that goes well , we 'll see about the rest . no one will suspect us , because no one would believe <number> people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this . 
ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab <number> ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about <person> <person> . 
georgina told me how kind you were to her . it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr. macfarlane . 
<person> redmond is an actor i admire enormously . 
it is not an effort . you are my son . besides ; i am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises . 
what are you doing over at the lanes that 's so dangerous , <person> ? 
oh , <person> , i 'm sorry . we were so tired from the branding . <person> barely made it to her bed and i did n't have the energy to take my clothes off . 
sort of . 
not the place you want to announce your arrival . 
i doubt it . 
<person> , we have nothing to talk about . 
<person> , it 's not your problem what she eats . 
come down to earth . do you think they would dare do anything like that ? do n't you think they 'd know that figure would be recognized ? shake your head real hard -- you 'll be all right . 
all right , i 'll grant you a bird 'll panic in an enclosed room . but , they did n't just get in . they came in ! right down that chimney . 
sure , sure charlie , you can help by just being yourself . 
i am not a child . 
no . i think i 'll stay right here in hell . 
i 'm being punished . 
<person> , i 'm setting up the crm-114 . 
how was ... ... the ballet ? 
how about the cop ? 
see ! that proves it ! <person> <person> 's fortune 's got ta be under this sand ! 
then you 'll be going to school here ... . ? 
good luck . that guy 's been in there since i got here . 
you 'd love to prove that . getting your name in the national geographic . 
you should have told me . 
wan na <person> ? 
and that does include the amp ? 
now do n't give me a hard time . 
soon . 
have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband ? 
i have no doubt of that . i 'll come by in the morning and we 'll arrange it . <person> , mrs. watchit . 
he 's passionate . 
i do n't know . 
who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me . my brother is dead , have some respect . 
i ca n't move to tidy . 
you ’ re kidding me ... 
mention my family once more and you 're dead . 
i mean -- i ca n't leave you here . you 'll have to go . i 'll tell mrs. ryan you were here . you can come back later . 
what happened to us , exactly ? 
well , you showed them . you 're rich and famous and successful . and you have a beautiful wife . 
this is good . this is real good . this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us . they 'll probably just lock us up for being idiots . 
i have of course observed the girl in treating her . 
you want me to contact <person> ? 
the point is , they want a man inside . 
youíre in prague ? 
es muy lindo , su coche -- 
should i call back and talk to your girlfriend ? 
meanwhile , he might find it . 
what i resent , lieutenant , is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment . what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men ... the day-care center i have to build where an officer 's lounge used to be ... and the ob/gyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears . but most of all , lieutenant , i resent your perfume , however subtle it may be , competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- <number> cent cigar , which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities . does it ? 
i 've never had anyone die before ... ... but i guess you get over it . i mean , eventually ... 
that 's not my ring . 
<number> week old . 
sean , come on out , man . what , you forget your favorite uncle ? 
yes . 
i played that game , <person> . in my head i played it a thousand times . 
it 's terrible -- you just made it up . 
tonight ? 
why 'd you do it , <person> ? 
give me a minute , talk to buddy . 
wait . you mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ? 
everyone ok ? 
mmnn . 
oh yes , of course . 
i would n't take that too seriously . 
you look awake to me . here . <person> some of this . 
he was caressing . 
<person> <person> on it . he seems anxious to clear my name . 
that 's good , <person> . for how much ? 
consuelo , i 'm sorry , but you know if you do n't speak english i ca n't understand you . 
you 've always hated the animals . 
shit . 
the witness will answer the question . 
this from a girl who still plays with dolls . 
what about <person> and <person> ? 
well , i ... 
<person> walter ! you fucking asshole ! 
it was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the earth -- but i was not allowed the opportunity . i have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society . we know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy . we also know that you are experimenting with rockets . 
it 's a little late for that . 
by a strange coincidence , i was thinking of you . 
that 's right . 
let me go ! 
<person> <person> is very well connected . if you were to let us go , i guarantee he would show you his appreciation , if you know what i mean . 
what the hell did you do ? 
yeah . i got some stuff for your cut . 
pretty as a picture . 
i feel sick . 
hello , how are you ? 
what 's going on ? 
taking <person> ? who ? who is taking <person> ? 
and ? 
you ca n't . 
you really look awful . 
oh ! <person> is cancelling the engagement . <person> has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke . ha , ha , ha -- hurry , come on . <person> -- there 's a line in front of the theatre since <number> o'clock . the house is jammed to the roof . 
what ? 
yes , of course , but very beautiful in your own right . 
who can say ... ? best thing for him , really . his therapy was going nowhere . 
i have no hard proof of any of this . her address is also on the photos . i think these people are involved with drugs . and murder . i think <person> is killing drug dealers and . . and somehow <person> is getting all their drugs . i had to tell you i got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to , but it 's over now for sure . .i had to tell you about these things in case it could help . 
all right . `` fratricide '' . minor technical detail . 
that 's enough , <person> . 
come on , <person> , you ca n't be serious ... . 
this is good . little hints of clove . 
accommodate ? i do n't think i know what you mean . 
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs . 
yeah , what ? 
yeah , no , she 's a go-getter , all right . 
<person> <person> -- if i had a quarter of a <number> dollars , believe me , i 'd know it . 
where were you sitting on the train ? 
<number> . 
officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple ... completely gutted . so were the first <number> cops to arrive on scene . 
i 'm sure he 'll be sorry to hear that . who should i tell him called ? 
nobody brought us here . our plane crashed . we were shot down by -- 
what are you talking about ? 
and why is that ? has something happened ? 
i 'm not honest ? 
you 're <person> 's < u > brother < /u > ? 
where are the bond certificates for the first ladies ? 
unless you 're out renting videos at other video stores . 
right . now who is the person in california ? the connection ? 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
no , i do n't think so . 
it 's not funny . according to this ... you 're already dead . 
good morning , gaston . 
no , no , no , what ... you can once , you can live without it once . come on . 
what 's happening here ? you 're dead ! 
go back . i 'm going to kill him . 
this has to end . 
oh , <person> ! ! hellboy -- ? ? is real -- 
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day . 
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you . 
he could n't have checked out -- i was supposed to meet him here . 
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum . 
he was looking out for you . 
there 's no one in the corridor but us . 
wait a minute . i just ... 
i - i really can not do that , your excellency . you see , he does n't know i 'm here . 
new york . 
what 's the matter with you ? 
listen , got a question for you . do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that ? 
so who are you ? 
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside ? 
well , i think ... 
when i get off work . 
pretty much . 
see ? 
shadow . 
<person> three , check . <person> behind you . 
you 're here a while , what 's wrong with a bank ? 
did your mom say if <person> was ... okay ? 
i do n't remember that on ingen 's list . 
albatross ? does n't inspire a lot of confidence . 
... not until i get a little something to remember you by . 
my dear senator , have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a bill passed ? 
what ? 
i 'm not saying anything . besides , you 're <number> to talk . you 're the one who 's got me on my knees in a dark alley . 
did you sign up yet ? 
<person> tramell . 
why ? it 's not dinner time yet . 
now ? okay . wait a minute . talent -- the only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance . 
thank you . would you like the man 's name ? 
what 's the matter ? are you sick ? 
he was scared . he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork . they were tryin ' to get him , he said . 
so how 'bout it , <person> <person> , do i make my deal with <person> ? or you gon na finally help me out , have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him . 
why not , mrs. <person> ? 
-- i 've already run it . there 's no record of any living relative . 
careful . that 's bad luck . 
all right , just a few questions . 
gary , hi . 
let go ! 
twice . in the parking lot . 
why was i assigned to you ? to debunk your work . to reign you in . to shut you down . 
yeah . 
your work . 
i did n't recognize you ! 
oh thank buddha it 's you , kim-lo , i 'm being held against my will , my civil rights have been violated and it took <number> days to make this <number> phone call ... 
just make sure you 're not caught . if you find something , you 've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules . if you find nothing -- he 's clear . 
is the word given ? 
i added air conditioning , put in the pool , made all those pillows by hand ... 
nothing ... it 's nothing . just ... i 'm reminded of a song i learned as a child . a song about pirates . 
tuesday at <number> , at the hinkley firehouse . 
he was dead ... that 's a poem . do you know what it means ? 
diego ? it 's <person> . 
... o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo ... 
took a pig-slicker to the heart . 
back ? 
bullshit ! if you 're going to hurt me , you hurt me now -- not some long ... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you do n't have the balls ! 
you 're quite a girl . 
would you do something for me ? please ? 
<person> ... 
what 're you gon na do about the papers ? somebody 's got ta pick 'em up . 
a year ago . <person> . a man and a woman . in a loft . you helped to murder them . 
i 'm always gon na be that . but i ai n't doing no more buck dancing . 
can i have a word with you ? 
we 've got another <number> hours of daylight . 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
would he know ? 
come on ... 
the <number> your husband opposed . they 're conning l.a. into building it , only the water wo n't go to l.a . it 'll go here . 
yes , it is . 
judge gave 'em the long ride . 
good to see you 're feeling better . 
how do you know that ? 
ha . <person> hands . you been counting money . if you had a $ <number> net and $ <number> worth of fish in it , and along comes <person> <person> , and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls . if you 'd ever worked for a living , you 'd know what that means . 
i do n't groom a horse to have it admired by others , i groom it because it needs grooming . 
so when did <person> leave ? 
hi . 
i 've had it with that bum , floyd . stack me a cooler . 
why ca n't you just drive me to my old school every morning ? 
especially , the <number> of the young nobleman , you remember ? 
`` anarchy '' <number> '' ? 
ridiculous ! just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up . you never saw me before . <person> , this town is full of white cadillac convertibles . i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate . you ready ? 
undoubtedly . not the ascetics of course but , well <person> <person> more ... 
no . but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself . its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other . if you make enemies on both sides of the border , you 'll end up dead . 
lovebirds , i see . 
some of you may have heard there 's a hurricane coming ! american soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty ! an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy ! anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh , feel free to lay down and die , you get me ? 
how 's that ? 
is that your `` expert opinion ? '' the only answer we 've had out of you is `` i do n't know . '' 
what are you people doing out in the middle of the night ? 
then why especially does it have to be in german ? 
let 's kick his ass . 
my parents wanted me here all along but my grades were n't good enough . i had to go to balincrest to pull them up .

yeah . 
hey , <person> , look . <person> , <person> . gim me that again , will yuh ? who 's gon na get him ? 
you see , major , you have nothing to worry about <person> . 
for the dupont chair . i swear . i 'm becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst . 
`` well , if you got drunk to talk to me about <person> <person> , do n't bother . i 'm not interested . i 've set back the sacred cause of reform , is that it ? all right , if that 's the way they want it , the people have made their choice . it 's obvious the people prefer <person> <person> to me . '' 
i¹m not . 
i agree . we play along for now , we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks .

he wanted me to kill him , but i did n't . he did it himself . 
i 've known soldiers who 've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you <number> . not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you did n't even know it 'd been stolen ! i 'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson 's school than anything from you guys .

it 's sanskrit . it tells the story of sankara climbing mt . <person> where he met the hindu god <person> . 
like what ? 
what is it ? 
perhaps you 're just polishing a stone , endowing this elephant man with qualities he does n't possess ? 
i 'd love to have a baby . but i ca n't ... 
you got to be in the army , you might as well have something slick to drive . 
still no confirmation either from sac or <person> <person> <person> . they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed .

huh ? oh . they said i was crazy . said i wanted to run it like a grocery store . 
uh , we already boxed some things . i figured you 'd want to go through dad 's stuff . it 's in there . if you want to get started . 
he said it made sense that <person> 's code was like <person> 's , that that cliché about great minds was true . said it was all about his own guilt . plus , he has a tendency to get <person> mixed-up with his dad once in a while . it always passes . 
no ... i can just tell .

they always let felons sit in on <person> <person> ? 
we make our own lives , <person> . as for malignancy , i do n't think so , it 's very unlikely . i probably should n't have even mentioned that possibility to her . 
what 's going on now ? what 's he doing ? 
i 'm a man without fear , <person> . i literally do n't care if i live or die . but even i ca n't fight human instinct . somebody suddenly starts shooting at me , i duck . but you ... what on earth were you thinking about ? 
there 's <number> coming . 
it is n't yankee whisky , <person> , it 's scotch .

<person> o'brien ? whoa ! what are you doing here ? 
switch the charts . 
no complaints . 
yes , but i lost him . i really did it quite brilliantly . i 'm beginning to think women make the best spies . 
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes <number> % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me . 
nice guys finish last . first rule of the jungle . 
i do n't really know . a compound organic-metallic alloy . stronger than titanium or carbon steel . harder than diamonds -- 
the police ?

nothing . 
it 's time . 
you fucked it up . <person> would n't freeze in those circumstances ? and i do n't care what her problems are . she would n't be the first one in that cast with problems . we have nothing to lose by making her an offer . 
quiet , will you ? this is ser- ious . our lives are in danger . 
hey there . i thought i heard somebody on the porch . was n't your name <person> ? 
remember the night we broke the windows in this old house ? this is what i wished for . 
and how i handle my < u > money < /u > ! 
the suit will stretch . you should try it -- 
you 're saying they mutinied for the gold ? 
lucky for us these chairs happened to be here . 
go on , tell the truth ; i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion . 
think of it as special assignment , mrs. peel . with a twist . you 're our chief suspect . 
feel free to form your own opinion . though it appears you already have . 
would you leave now , please ? 
well ... i 'm <number> of the few people who likes you . 
jill , i 'm just trying to be helpful . 
you have ? 
okay , look . it 's an important meeting . <person> thought , if it was just lawyers -- 
i 've been taking pictures so long i do n't know how to read anymore . 
so , i saw you put that book down your trousers . 
you 're fired . 
i said i 'll take care of it . now , a man of your position should n't be a part of what 's about to go down . so go home and i 'll call you tomorrow . 
not if it works . i 'll meet you at the train ? 
that 's correct . 
sir -- - 
hildy ! 
... i was just talking to that girl in the other room . 
this is where he vanished . 
you 're jet-lagged . we 'll talk about this back ... 
i dunno ... i just like <person> <person> . 
what ? what 've i done ? 
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign . autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out <number> of the stab films . 
fucking a . 
<person> said it sounded like something <person> would be messed up in . 
right . long live ... what 's your planet ? 
maybe we should pay luther a visit . 
it 's legitimate . 
i never even got to be single . 
employed ? 
the renting agent and the tailor . 
i 'm sure . 
actually , i was just looking for a restroom . 
please . you 're in danger . 
yeah , when did that start ? come on , man ! it 's what people want to see , and you know it . 
i do n't know . 
well , some of his throat was there . 
you know who you want . i 'll take your seat any day . so do something ... do n't sleep on it ... go over there . i do n't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it 's not always good to let things calm down . 
bad news . 
you have to be careful what you say in front of the others ... they frighten easy . it 's always been that way , most men frighten easy . 
it ca n't take that long . 
you 're trying to make me feel guilty . 
hey ... dewey . can we go now ? 
i am not interested in what you would rather ; i want to keep going . i am also offering you the money , so we do n't have to turn them over because you can borrow . 
stop ! ! ! ! 
you broke up with my machine ? 
bites what ? 
no , i think i do n't want your money . i think you fucked up my office . and i think you 're going away . 
hello ... ? 
you must be joking . 
oh god , i 'm so glad , <person> , that you 're coming ... 
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet . i was up for going to bixby . i was getting excited . 
you 're wrong . things happened today , okay ? things that probably ruined my chances with <person> . 
i 'll go into town with you . 
yeah . 
then what will ? and what will bring her back ? and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me ? why did n't he take my life instead of hers ? it was my fault -- i was late -- she gave me her hiding place ... ! ! 
oh , yes . 
does it burn ? 
yes . 
well ? 
just tell him to call me . 
-- is that right ? 
i do n't know what that means . what kind of problem ? 
enid , can i talk to you for a minute ? 
susie , i told you i did n't approve of that boyfriend . he was too old for you . you let him come into this house and be fresh to me . i went out <number> day and old mrs. jensen next door saw <person> 's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus . 
how much do you owe ? 
what 're you going to do today ? 
champagne on the rocks . oh-could i have that with a twist ? she starts to sink back in her chair and <person> leans over and pulls her back up . 
what 's on your mind ? 
thirty-five next generation microchips . <person> , not silicon . <person> : <number> <number> each . 
look ... 
i see `` elegant . '' 
news ? 
... is there ? 
<person> ripped it up , right ? 
maybe you 'll catch it . 
oh , i thought you were my <number> o'clock . make it fast , i 'm expecting someone . 
okay , this is no laughing matter . 
if somebody 's aboard her already , she ai n't ours . she 's theirs . 
shasta ! now why 'd you go and scare the nice man like that ? sorry about that , mister . let 's see , you want $ <number> . you try to have a nice day now , would you ? 
did n't i say that ? 
a single hour . 
what do you want to know ? 
hiya , <person> . 
<person> . 
who ? applejack ? 
are n't you ? 
they say it hit both sides of his brain ... even if he makes it he 's gon na be a vegetable . 
no . i saw nothing . 
we 're outta motion lotion . 
how 'bout i give you to <number> , then i organize your fuckin ' brains all over the wall back there . <number> ... 
i 'm contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers -- 
<number> days ago , would you have even hit me ? let alone so powerfully ? 
who are you ? 
actually of course i wo n't operate , i do n't do major surgery . dr. <person> will operate and of course he 'll be guided by your wishes in this respect . 
no . 
i 'm sorry about that -- but i had nothing to do with it . 
for me . i 'm a reporter , <person> . i 'm breaking the drug story and i got the chief red-handed . <person> gave me a deposition . 
maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us . they probably do n't think anyone would dare try . 
but if , when i love , i am unhappy , i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune . 
you mean about y'all bein ' together in `` that '' way ? 
are you a fan of <person> <person> ? 
the hoop-dee-doo ! 
insurance . <person> of london . 
good . 
thanks , i already ate . 
no matter what you say to me , i still think you 're the greatest guy i ever knew . 
are you employed , sir ? 
c'mon , <person> , pick up a job . 
therefore , i shall ignore you . 
i finished that . i 'm just messing around . 
where 'd they go ? 
i know , dad . 
if we could relay the sunlight- 
it means we should all live happily for <number> <number> years . the family . if my father were alive , it 'd be true . 
if the japanese are pansies , then pansies are my kind of people . <person> steps over to the booth with their food . the buzz burger has <number> holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball . <person> sees the <number> sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner . 
of course not ... 
ebbie . <person> ... umph ... lable ... 
... two-thirty-seven . 
you could n't get these shutters open ? 
<person> <person> is your dad . 
it 's only <number> night , <person> . <person> 's not forget who we 're doing this for ? 
you ca n't fire on them . you 're gon na detonate the crystals . 
i say we do n't want to appear greedy . 
triplets . 
we 're growing very concerned back here . there 's no use pretending otherwise . we 're rapidly approaching a 'condition red . ' people are beginning to ask difficult questions . 
why did n't you tell us ? why did n't you tell us ? 
but before i retired , you might say i had a brief time in the sun . <person> , as it were . tell me , do you like motion pictures ? 
but you were pulling your hips last night . 
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these <number> look pretty young . 
yeaup , but those grosses are inflated . 
gurney ... i see <person> <person> among the captives . let him stand free . 
how the ... did he get in there ?

don ? 
yeah . it 's really good . 
now what do we do ? 
yes . 
thanks ... for all your help . 
sometimes dreams just do n't mean nothin ' ... <person> comes into your mind and you do n't have no control over , you know ? anyways , dreams ai n't no odder than real life . sometimes not by half . 
probably . 
thirty ? 
no , this is about getting something right and claryfying <number> of your answers to an earlier question -- 
very well . 
yeah , well my parents wanted me to go to northwestern . i did n't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- i mean , how am i supposed to know what my `` most emotionally significant moment '' was ? so when my u of m acceptance came in december , i said the hell with it . 
<person> sandy , what were you blowing up out there ? your mom was pretty p.o . 'd . 
he said , 'do n't mind him . his job is to criticise , your job is to conduct . ' 
i want to go talk to him . 
she knows enough not to be here . 
oh , my god , <person> ! what are you doing here ? 
if it is , that 's pretty high up on the totem pole . what do you think ? 
it is . 
we face each other as <person> intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone . 
why did n't you tell me the truth about him ? 
get good at it . 
until dallas , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race . 
what do you mean by 'dirty looks ' ? 
do you believe i love you ? 
about what ? 
what about <person> ? he 'd jump at the opportunity . 
okay , a blur . 
what do you want ? 
... there ai n't nothin ' can kill 'em . they can live for <number> even <number> <number> years . 
<number> last question , <person> . if someone did n't know better , would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine ? 
dead ! 
why would n't i ? 
<person> daniels . do n't worry , i 'm paying for it . 
it 's not your fault , <person> . the letter i wrote you , they -- 
why us ? 
<person> was my counselor in my freshman year . that 's probably where i got the idea for the icepick . for my book . <person> how the subconscious works . <person> is my friend . 
so what are you telling me , you 're putting on <number> comics in a row ? 
come with us , sir . 
a paratrooper named <person> . he 's going home , if he 's alive . 
i see . then <number> more quick question , <person> <person> ; since we at the post would like to , uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business ? 
well , something has to be done about this budget . it 's completely unrealistic . you allowed nothing for limousine service . 
listen to me , fella ... 
hey , where 'd those chicks go ? 
mrs. christian , <person> <person> here . 
i just do n't think it would work . 
i 'll need a room over there that faces this way . how much a week ? 
oh , no , not at all . maybe just a bit . 
the red knight ! 
well ? 
you looked like you did ?

<person> hire , i 'm warning you -- do n't swear ! 
i asked you a question . are you clear about that ? 
god damn ... kid never had a chance ... 
i may need you to go to work practically immediately . but meanwhile perhaps you 'd like to meet some of your fellow officers . 
let me out . i have to talk to you . 
because i 'm planning on dying soon . 
since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense , he asks that this statement be read into the record . 
hey , <person> . you wan na get some ice cream ?

on a 6-1 shot ? the hell with ya . we 'll keep the deal we got . 
i 'm sure i 'm fit for at least <number> hundred miles . 
i ca n't control mine- i 'd be lost without the shame factor driving me . 
you 're not my father ! 
no particular reason . catch a laker game . i heard we got <person> ... 
you 're a lawyer ? 
he does n't know ? how come he does n't know ? 
what a fuckin ' job .

i was a little worried about the line of my throat . this woman has done wonders with it . 
i do n't know what else . you 've been that route a little , have n't you ? 
yeah . <person> had something to do with that bank in idaho . 
you must n't be a tattletale , dear . you must n't be delilah-ish and jezebel-ish toward your brother , dear . 
we have to stick with the plan . 
now ? why not tomorrow ? after the show . 
no way i it does n't make sense . 
yes ma'am , i do . 
i just do n't have anything very interesting about my life . 
you need treatment , mrs. peel . you ca n't resign . 
hey , i just want to know where i stand . what chance -- 
yes . 
if <person> is beyond our comprehension , and she -- -- is here for reasons that ca n't be understood , is n't god here ?

you want to be a bounty hunter . why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter ?

help me ! help me ! 
are you sure ? 
sweltering . come on , i 'll take you home .

yes . i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed , deserved , and available . 
hey , <person> . are you still a virgin ?

go ! go ! 
how long were you together ? 
there , what ? i did n't see anything . 
there were a few guys in my class with names like <person> <person> , <person> <person> . i 'd see them up ahead in the hall , call their name , but they would n't turn around . c.i.a . <person> thing , they 'd always disappear after the first half of the course . 
that 's your offer ? you , sailing away nice and pretty with the black pearl , and all i have is a name ? 
what ? 
well . the only thing i 've been certain of , all this time , is that i need to get to the ocean . the point is no one seems to know how to get there . 
is that a fact . 
if you must know , virtually nothing . 
and i ... i 've got other things happening . 
you 're wrong , wesley . the guilt is mine -- all of it .

well , well -- yeah -- i got smart and thought i 'd slip <number> over on the old man in the press meeting . i said , `` <person> president , about the monopoly investigation -- '' and he jumps right in and says , `` diz , if you were sitting in my chair , would you answer the question you 're about to ask ? '' he had me . 
look , i do n't mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks . so i 'd appreciate it if you would n't distract me . 
oh -- there 's no real thing -- it does n't exist . 
who is this ? 
turns out you did me a favor . you 're looking at a rich man . 
do n't it ever scare you it wo n't be nice in california like we think ? 
well , i say lets tear this place apart for weapons . so when they burst through that door , we 'll make 'em wish they never did . 
you got ta have a call sign that 's just your own ... never changes ... you have to recognize it immediately . then , if someone shouts `` <person> , break left ! `` ..you react right away . 
my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ? 
yeah . yeah . well , anyway , we 've got `` saunders '' settled . maybe that was my trouble all along . yes , *sir* . i 'm all ready to go now -- what 's your *first* name ? 
oh , cut it out , will ya ? 
it 's not his fault ! 
you 'd be surprised how many offers i did n't get . even <person> would n't stick around for this . it really is n't easy . 
ready ? 
conflict resolution is my job , <person> . 
strange . 
i do n't know , clarence , `` <person> <person> '' is a pretty big movie . 
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that 's just trickery and flummery . 
yes , <person> i think you 're very pretty . you 've got these great big sparkling eyes , the cutest little nose , an amazing mouth . 
outside ! 
romance ! 
meet me at my studio at <number> o'clock . if you 've got the will maybe we can stop this thing . 
so who are these people with the boss ? 
for what ? 
plans ? 
my business , <person> . as for your business -- <number> question , or there 's no use going . this girl -- what does she mean to you ? how far are you willing to go to save her ? 
i suppose you want to know where i 'm going to kill tonight , <person> ? 
well , you know what that would do to me . 
a book society award is a very prestigious thing . 
- perhaps more than <number> . there 's so much i want to know . i 've heard your story in bits and pieces ... your home in wisconsin , your tragic marriage , your financial attachment to <person> - it started in san francisco , did n't it ? i say - your idolatry of <person> started in san francisco , did n't it ? 
what 'll you do if <number> of them catches you ? 
you know , blonde , thin , whatever ... 
yes , <person> . i have seen it before . it happens to old people . 
what are we waiting for ? let 's go . 
because i quit breathing . 
guinevere , godiva , i sense enemy sol ... 
uh , <person> <person> , i -- 
you wanted me to kill him , did n't you ? 
perhaps it was the smoke . 
i swear to god . 
it 's not working . i recharged it before i left . it should be good for hours -- 
i 'd love to stop him , but have you noticed the <number> armed men ? 
i 'm just not <number> of those guys who has a `` type '' ... 
you guessed it . the card 's phony . i got plenty of 'em . different names , different jobs . i work out of san francisco . go anywhere , do anything . all it takes is the folding . 
kimberly ? it 's dad . 
fucking a , my friend . 
you lie ! all white men lie ... and kill ... 
in where ? 
no . 
you just call ? 
we should get back -- what ? 
oh no . i smell it . 
jail ! <person> , bubber ... this is crazy . we could fall off of here . 
no i do n't . 
got any booze in the house ? 
i have to put my family 's welfare on the line here , my friend ! and what are you puttin ' up ? you 're puttin ' up words ! 
u-huh . 
you ca n't take that . 
where ? 
well , there 's not much time . 
if i spill , my life wo n't be worth a nickel . 
... someone said caffeine -- for a headache ... does n't seem ... 
tell her ... we 'll get him . 
that girl 's an idiot . 
got the number of the motel out on the old highway ? bates , i think . 
why surely , <person> president , there must be some mistake . i mean ... 
how about trying your fine italian hand ? 
when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me . 
alice ! 
<number> : there 's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you 'd be wasting your time . 
yes , m'sieu laval ? 
who was that ? 
but i thought the whole thing was your idea ? 
the power ... i need ... more power ... to control ... the storm -- 
it was snowing . 
you mean like pedal pushers ? 
once we nail <person> , that 's it . <person> is ours . 
if i had to explain it you would n't understand . just say we 're brothers to the bone . 
you have to play , <person> . do n't want to disappoint your dad . he 's been waiting around all night . 
new mouthpiece . been waiting <number> weeks for this . kids keep swiping them all the time . they use 'em for bean shooters . what can i do for you gentlemen ? 
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects . 
another dab ? 
enough to go to prison ? <person> ' px scam , <person> was in on it -- 
<person> ... 
yes , <person> president , we attempted to contact <person> <person> , but he was too ill to ... 
just the way the world works . look , as far as tweakers go , you are n't a bad guy . you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know . 
yeah . but when something bad happens , something really bad -- the wall breaks . the fabric tears . 
you 're shaking . 
tomorrow we will continue our advance on ulundi . <person> , kindly return to your unit bring them here immediately to support <person> . mr vereker will join you as adc . do you understand me clearly ? 
we 're not even sure what it was . 
would you like me to leave ... ? is this a bad time -- ? 
oh , did - did you see that ? 
that was <number> days ago . <person> , i think this place is a bit boring . it 's all white . why does n't the guy put up some posters ? maybe some bullfight things . . . 
stop it ! you do n't deserve the green destiny . 
look fella ... this is private ... 
when i last saw you , i was unprepared . i did not know what to expect . in these past weeks , i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . you have to understand who i am and what i am . i am a musician and i believe in music . i am an artist and i believe in art . art in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man 's spiritual needs . i must confess , however , to being extremely naive . i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . my entire life was devoted to music because , and this is very important , because i thought that i could , through music , do something practical . 
i 'm glad you 've come to talk with me , doolittle . it 's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me . 
you think they are confidential ? i do n't know anything about how this town works , i have n't lived here a year yet . 
under the circumstances . charmed to know you , <person> . 
did you hear me , sir , because -- 
do n't bring her to the house no more . 
i 'm scared shitless . 
or a big mother slug maybe ? 
i 'm not here to fight . 
did n't happen yesterday , i 'll tell you that . torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat . 
oh , lord , chance - i do n't know what i was expectin ' from you ... i 'm sorry for yellin ' like i did ... no sir , i just do n't know what i was expectin ' ... ... i 'spose i 'd better gather up some breakfast for you ... 
he was afraid of you . he knows a tough guy when he sees <number> . 
oh , you ... ... ennh . 
perhaps i 'm old-fashioned . i know it was supposed to be very warm there , mitch , but ... well ... actually ... well , the newspaper said she was naked . 
i 'm here to see iris . 
we 're anxious to know who this man is -- the <number> calling himself dyle . 
what a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time . tell max i want to be buried with royalties ... 
i 'm this way . i guess this is goodbye . 
fuck you , <person> . 
you just would n't . it 's not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night . 
l.t. , in this office i 'd prefer you say italian-americans . 
i 'll think about it . 
small talk . 
help me get in the truck . 
we do not ask for your poor or your hungry . 
i had my license hearing coming up and i did n't wan na leave anything to chance . 
it 's an advance . we want him to know he 's going to be happy here . 
so is that what all this is ? someone have a problem with us living here ? 
you 've got to go now , <person> -- 
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder . 
bring the crane over . come down . easy down . 
you do n't have to—why , we 're with you , <person> <person> . we just lost our heads and acted like a mob . why , we . . . 
how the hell did you do that ? 
good eye . not <number> club owner got it . they all ask me why i got <person> <person> on my card . 
that 's fine . 
never know down there . <person> to have a friend , sometimes . 
who is this ? 
you gon na smoke the cigarette ? 
do n't mind him finnegan ... you remember <number> ... balls of steel ... splashing around in a sea of testosterone . 
you know , <person> , this book never would have survived without you . when it gets to new york , there will be a big auction , and whatever it brings we can split . god knows you 're entitled to it . 
no ... that was n't right . i want you to be my wife . 
i 'm afraid she ca n't do that , <person> . it would endanger her . 
blood and guts . 
he was a crooked bastard . he would have killed us . 
`` ay me , sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ? '' 
what <number> ? 
go ! 
on screen ... 
if they had any reason to . why make it tough for themselves ? why go to all that trouble ? here 's an open book . close it . no reason to keep it open . she was a nice girl , anyway . and perhaps she did n't kill him on purpose . perhaps she did n't kill the other one . you never know . give her the benefit of the doubt . leave her stay where she is . close the book . <person> . 
i read your book . the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking . 
can i help you ? 
<person> heard it . 
i 'm a man . 
put your pilot on . 
oh- 

i never saw <person> until she set foot in this convent . my sister ran away from home . we lost touch with her . and when my husband died and i came here , she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened . 
would you like to sell it ? 
killed ? 
i can talk it over ; possibly i can get the money . when are you meeting the man ? 
gee-zus . 
yeah , i can see that . later i want you to teach me that trick , but right now we have a job to do . 
i do n't remember the name . it was near a beach . 
is she looking at me , baby ? 
too late ? jody , it was an accident . 
<number> continued : 
it 's never happened . we 've never had an unsatisfied customer . 
what else ... ? let 's see ... you have complete freedom . 
yes , thank you , sir . 
i heard ya lady is wild . 
how long do you intend -- ? 
there 's <number> thing you oughta understand by now , thelma , it 's not your fault . 
very good , sir . i 'll have a porter bring it in . 
of course not . if he has n't already accidentally pelleted himself , i 'm sure he 's lost . 
-- and that squeaker the aggies dropped to oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal -- 
you see , i do n't care if we are rich or poor -- i do n't care if we 're big or small , all i care about is <person> . he was the first man i loved . he never used to care about money -- we were poor as <person> 's turkey , but none of us minded . now i 've seen him drive the poor from the door , and we used to be poor ourselves . i 've seen him get hard and mean , and he is n't hard or mean . i 've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding . that 's not like him , <person> <person> -- it must be my fault somehow -- my fault . 
that means we got ta subpoena time- life on it . 
have you known this all along ? 
if you do n't mind me asking ... who are you ? 
oh my god . are you serious ? 
it 's been delightful meeting you both . 
yes , but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low . 
as much as for a lord ? what an honor ! did your king give you other wealth apart from horses ? 
i 've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect <number> of the biggest decisions of my life . and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas , chasing phantom tanker trucks . 
it 's a three-act story with a tragic end . 
my dad . he played in the minors for a while , when he got out of college . 
maybe i oughta talk to this ray bones character myself . see if he wants to invest in my movie . 
i suppose that 's right . 
yeah ? ! 
i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . besides , what could we use for tools ? a steak knife ? a corkscrew ? 

what 's the difference ? we 've got him . help me here . we 'll have to force feed him . 
yeah , he got boxes in his stomach . he 's taller than me . 
you want a tip ? 
i do n't want to talk any more . 
paper or cloth ? 
the dirty snowball at its core . 
it 's cold . 
what 's that ? 
forget it 's there . 
sure . it sounded like a number <number> tune all right . 
always the drugs . 
excuse me ? 
it 's video . 
i can not go with you . 
oh . i did n't know . i 'll take you to the best restaurant in town . you 'll miss a great meal and i 'll keep the scarf , anyway . what 's your name ? 
that 's some long green . 
i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation ... for all i know , she may be trying to get in touch with me , at home . i 'd better go home . 
you cried ? i 've never once cried . <person> ... 
back in . 
does everyone in the world know more than me ? <person> , i 'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff ... ..lifted a piece of licorice when i was <number> and a half . who knew it would lead ... they even got the cia involved ! 
yeah . well , was the least i could do . 
where 's <person> today ? 
i 'm here . 
if you let me go , i will tell you where he is . 
tell your friend i 'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow . we 'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better . and make sure i can get to that window this time . 
how ? 
and i certainly would n't tell <person> . 
you know , tomorrow 's a very big day for me ... it would be nice if you acted like you understood . 
maybe we should call for a cab . 
uh-hub . 
we 're going for a walk . 
how do i load ? 
the girl 's name was <person> . that 's all i know . 
could be . 
you all right ? 
i 'll take you later . 
that 's a maiden name . 
discouraging , is n't it ? women with furs like that where it never gets cold ... 
say , <person> . i think he 'll be better off doing it his way . 
she probably got a date by now , <person> . 
that thing ? who 'd you steal it from ? 
now that 's pretty important , dean . you also told the fbi when you met him , he was <number> foot <number> . then you tell the commission he was <number> foot <number> . how the hell did the man shrink like that , dean ? 
yes , madame ! 
i really must thank you . 
had to take him to the hospital . <person> had dr. <person> stuck half way up his butt , could n't get it out . 
our agency monitors all threats very carefully , and there 's good reason to believe <person> <person> has the training , the connections , and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large . 
a surprise ? 
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth . take my advice and make that bet . 
on behalf of the teamsters ' <person> <person> , it is my pleasure to present to you . . . 
what did he say ? what did he say ? 
god , i m so mad at him ! ! 
he has come for <person> . 
hey - you 're bleeding . 
and i 'd like your help , determining who 's bidding for their purchase . 
will you finally cut it out ? just in case you have n't noticed , i am trying to write a book here . and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it 's a pretty tough job . so why ca n't you just leave me alone ? 
means what it says . the scorpion does what is in his nature . take off the hood , man . 
yeah , thanks . 
well , let me let you in on <number> more fact you obviously do n't know . if i were to take my men away , <person> <person> would snap your neck like a twig . 
frank ... the giant bunny rabbit ? 
but what brought you to sicily ? 
... that 's all right . 
why ? 
i know his work better than i know him . 
that 's the way i feel about it . 
you know what would be cool is , like , to do a music video , you know ? but , like , you know , have it set in here . you know , like , like , like , with her and shit . you know , like , you know , like , `` closed , closed , closed , closed , closed , closed . '' 
i mean ... ill. she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died ... i was only <number> ... and it must have been a strain . oh , she did n't have to go out to work or anything , <person> left us with a little something ... anyway , a few years ago ... <person> met a man . he talked her into building this motel ... we could have talked her into anything ... and when . well ... it was just too much for her when he died , too ... and the way he died ... oh , it 's nothing to talk about when you 're eating . anyway , it was too much of a loss for my mother ... she had nothing left . 
you would n't even know where to get <number> . 
<person> was comin ' out . 
i said , i 'm not my sister . 
your mom and the boys can drop by anytime . 
-- yah , restructurin ' the amount of retards they had workin ' for them . 
right . 
no ... no ... the worst was when i went in for this after-school special and i 'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids . i see they 're all signed in for the same role as me ... 
no , it 's what body builders drink to beef up . 
a myth..just a myth ... should n't you be checking out their countersurveillance ? 
-- so when are you going to egypt ? 
the d.a . came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . <person> 's lawyer comes in and <number> minutes later , the d.a . comes out looking like he 'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man . they took his statement and cut him a deal . 
gwen , my wife 's dead . 
i hear he did n't mean to . the cop fell as <person> was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart . 
never mind his excellency -- you got ta your pocketbook ? 
am i interrupting ? 
me ? 
repeat it anyway -- it 's a wonderful cue . 
right here . 
thoreau with a lawnmower . 
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon . 
do you believe in what we 're doing here , private johnson ? 
but your daughter is still alive . 
yes . 
can i steal you for a minute ? 
it 's those files you asked for . 
oh , me too . i used to cook for my friends ' parties and things back in atlanta . 
what 's up ? 
what are you doing ? 
where 's he making his big speech ? 
of course . <person> . nice to see you . 
daya deo dono <person> . <person> ! 
i 'm soldier of the republic , you 'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo . a nation once again . 
<number> set of muddy shoe prints . 
from the korean war . 
... very difficult to get in . 
i 'll handle that later . 
hmmm ? 
he 's done . he 's dying . 
colette , go . 
with everything that was going on in my life , i just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- i needed time . <person> bought me that time . i owe him so much . 
listen , i just found out we 've got real problems in sicily ! 
hello ? 
how come nobody knows about him ? and you do ? 
what do you wish me to do ? 
why is it moving ? 
why ? 
you 're all through with this now ? 
and another thing , the paper said no will was found . but every toon knows <person> had a will and , in it he promised to leave <person> to the toons . 
i think they 'll probably have booze there . 
everybody thinks that . 
it 's going to cost you two-hundred dollars . 
<person> christ , man , you look like hell . 
helen , tell matt i want to see him . 
no . 
oh , really ? 
what do you need ? 
no . i 'm going to find out . 
i do n't buy it and neither will a jury . 
yes , but what good did it do ? 
and german ? 
uh hum . 
for your own sake ... for the others ... i ... 
hi . <person> <person> . 
they think i 'll make friends if we move . just move and everything 'll be roses and sunshine . 
i 'm not sure ... maybe it simply exists in the search for it . maybe its something we have to make for ourselves . 
i placed ... ? 
you had all those cattle there , so i 'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive ? 
everything stays as it is ! 
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man , and some people from the committee to re-elect , yes ma'am . 
i 'm not wearing a bra . 
<person> ? 
it 's totally out of context . i was protecting the national security . i never intended -- 
oh , waski , you do n't know anything . 
what do you want , <person> ? 
i suppose it 's too late to start over . 
will you stay here for the night ? you can leave in the morning . that 's when my parents get back and -- 
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do n't think at some point somebody might notice that she 's gone ? 
the car . all you want is the car ? 
i took it from my fake husband . 
a dubious distinction , no ? 
they look pretty smart , i think . 
where , sir ? 
yes - 
okay . see you around . 
i 'm married . 
i know . 
no . we work the land alone . <number> but <person> <person> and i are permitted contact with the public . 
oh yeah ? oh , how 'd you ship it over there , man ? federal express ? hm ? by the time it got there it 'd be way cold and coagulated . total waste . cheese be stuck to the cardboard . 
what report ? 
where 'd you get the money , huh ? 
what do you want it for ? 
and i smoke . i smoke all the time . 
i liked you better frozen . you did n't talk so much . 
yes . i mean are you actually talking about this , or are we just ... 
please , sir , do n't kick my ass ! i 'll do anything to get out of a beating ! 
<person> put the gun down -- 
you did the right thing . never try to understand a press message . about half the time we use codes -- especially with dr. gonzo . 
we 're going to die ! 
oh we ... we ... 
it 's hot in here ... 
i do n't want to say goodbye . 
or a tunnel or a bridge ... 
i do n't get it . 
he looks perfectly fine .

yes . 
c'mon . let 's go to the ho -- - 
and what do you do with the bones ?

let 's have a minimum of pretending . i 'll want to do a column about you- 
i did n't say i was good at it . 
same thing he wanted in prague ! same thing he 's always wanted ! the noc list ! 
more or less .

my ... name is ... 
how you doing , pal ? 
so am i . but where 's my money ? 
where are you going ? 
what are your people called ? 
it was n't your fault , <person> . you had your brother . 
leaving them here when we could just as well take them . we got plenty of room in the wagon . and -- and -- they cook and drive the mules . they do n't bother anybody . 
then how come they have n't set the bail yet ? that 's unconstitutional . 
got ta situation here . where are you ? stuck in traffic ? 
you see what i 'm sayin ' ? you control the space . 
is <person> part of this ? 
it 's weird ... 
do it again . 
elena , it 's not what you think . it 's not a big plot . <person> . <person> . i do n't know if you want to go over this now , but it 's just something that comes over me . i do n't feel good about it . i know i 've done what i did n't want to do . i do n't know -- 
would you like to do me ? 
your father knew it too . but he was never sure how much was pretense . 
the congressman 's very happy to have your support , but he 's heard that there 's an investigation . 
that 's , uh ... that 's pretty serious stuff there . 
thanks for the invitation , but i have my own apartment . 
you did n't have to kill <person> . 
you 'd feel what ? 
what you got me up here for ? 
it 's a comedy . 
what 's that ? 
suga . go ahead and get us something to smoke on . 
aw , i 'm sorry , <person> <person> . it 's just kind of sudden , that 's all . sure , i 'm excited . i think it 's great . only , well , you 've done so much for me already . . . i 'll never be able to thank you enough . 
we were called in by the jerome base ... 
i want to be an actor . 
certainly , <person> dewitt ... 
what ? ! 
who ? 
the crowd had to dig it . 
hey -- i 'm on your side . remember that . 
you 're the guys from the movie ! 
must be <person> two-five stuff . <person> fifteen thousand . 
he does n't know . 
who said that ? 
well , i left someone very special behind . 
that 's right . 
well are n't you the smoothie . now you 're going to ask for my number , i suppose . 
<person> ? 
no , no , that 'll be fine . i do n't mind . sure . 
i do n't think so . 
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6 , which must have been a spare . 
scott , you ca n't save everyone . 
mom ? 
looks like i got a plane to catch . 
well , she had problems -- 
can we make it a <number> ? 
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here . 
that 's what i 'd planned to ... 
there 's hope and promise in it , <person> -- planting and promise of good harvest to come . 
the ah ... the radio 's out . 
wendy ... 
come on tough guy . listen to me . you are going to tell <person> that it was all an accident . <person> cowboy ? you got me ? 
no . 
will you bring me a hanger ? 
your hair 's different . 
but <person> said ...

i was at home , where were you ? 
uh , mr . the plague , uh , something weird 's happening on the net . 
i ca n't . i 'll get <person> ! ! 
well , <number> thing immediately comes to mind , if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter . 
then tell her i 'll come by in the morning . we need to talk .

<person> ' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street . 
how 'd you get here ? your moms give you ride -- ? 
i want you to give up your work ... . 
what 's his family background ? 
that creature helps no one . and none who go there return . 
so says her website . 
father ... 
what do you think ? 
when ? 
sebastian , you faggot . is she with you ? 
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors . 
a practical man , sir . given the marquis ' unusual tastes , a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent . 
how did they think that ? what are they ... crazy ? what do you mean . that 's bullshit , <person> . they 're giving you a fucken story . 
why did you change your mind about bringing us along ? 
oh boy . if he only knew .

<person> <person> <person> . 
they switched us over .

same as you . <number> thousand . 
we sell children 's toys -- 
yes , but important people are concerned about this . judge <person> spoke to <person> <person> -- 
<number> , two-fifty . 
someone else might call it stalking . my dad felt it . he started carrying a gun . 
lay off of that stuff , son . it upsets your mother . 
but at what cost ? your ship ... your son . 
got it . 
you know ... sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth . 
what boat ? 
well that 's lovely talk , that is . and another thing , why are n't you at school ? 
at least i let you tag along . 
sir , yes , sir ! 
will you promise me that ? 
ready ? 
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you . grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes . 
look at the gaslight . do n't tke your eyes off it . you will be drained to the point of death , but you must stay alive . do you hear me ? 
yeah , and it 's the truth , to the best of my knowledge . and , frankly , i 'm glad . for <person> 's sake , i 'm glad , not yours . i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart . <person> should n't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age . 
what ... ? 
uh , <person> ? the , um , ballistics guy , <person> ... ? he called , and ... his tests show that <person> 's gun fired the bullet that killed <person> <person> . 
you said it was a strange world . and you 're the strangest part of it . are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps . 
he does n't want my help any more . he does n't need it . 
what do you mean ? 
yeah . he 's so cool and mysterious . 
maybe it is n't going to sonora , but it 's going somewhere , which is all right with me . 
... armed robbery ... 
well , obviously these tests were n't designed for this but fundamentally they 're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy . 
you wo n't be teaching this <number> either . she 's my wife . 
yes . it was . thanks for the compass . i 'll look after it for you . 
come here . 
i know . 
i like well your conceit , <person> . <person> rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world . 
no ! i have to get there . 
you have precious little time . what i 've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists . you hold in your hand the power to end the project . 
did they find out anything when they questioned her ? 
maybe he would . we applied for officers ' training together , remember ? they turned me down , but i 'm glad to see you made it . of course , it could n't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it ! his mother 's got <number> <number> dollars .

you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside . 
i do n't believe a thing she just said . 
look , uh , i 've been thinking about everything you told me . 
what 's causing the readings ? 
this kid just wants his freedom .

<number> years . that crime 's old , man . they ai n't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin ' people . how they gon na find room for you ? 
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at <number> ...

did you know that <person> <person> is back from school ? 
nothing . he had <number> days . 
you 're kidding me .

'' 
you do n't like <person> , do you ? 
all right . now that you explain it i see that you 're right . 
cut him loose ? 
that 's right , preacher . i robbed that bank because i got tired of seein ' children roamin ' the woodlands without food , children roamin ' the highways in this year of depression ; children sleepin ' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps ; and i promised myself i 'd never see the day when my youngins 'd want . 
not if they do n't catch us , <person> . 
c'mon -- <person> ? ? 
captain , i 'm getting a message from <person> <person> <person> .

i ... you told me your name was <person> . you told me a <number> times , back in the truck , telling me you were n't <person> -- 
i 'll bear that in mind ... what ? oh . <person> . <person> -- my stomach could n't hold a bird seed .

i wish there was something i could do ... . 
she could make you drop <number> pounds in <number> class . she 's completely gifted ! 
should n't we pay 'em for the damages ? 
no , i mean how would you do it ? do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what ? 
that country shit all sounds the same to me .

whenever he played <person> <person> , who do you think was right there in the front row ? 
jesus , i 'd like to book him into a psychiatrist 's office . he comes in here ranting and raving , dumping his crap all over the place ... could you prove it , <person> ?

there you go . 
completely . 
well , lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i 'd kinda like to talk to you about <number> of them in particular . it 'd be a big help . 
and you ? 
yeah ... sid ? 
how are you going to find him ? 
you 're talking about the woman i love . 
how about <person> <person> . 
i know . you told me . i 'm okay with it . 
vain . proud . such a person is <person> . he is not plain . 
may i ask how < u > you < /u > dealt with the test ? 
i thought you had this all figured out . good going 'irwin . ' 
<number> , <number> months ago . when i was at computer crime . i got into a chat room with someone named mydick . i 'd talked to him before . everything i saw yesterday , everything in the autopsies , it 's identical . the forensics are dead on . mydick 's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig , nylon cord , torture with pliers , rip the nipples -- when the `` item '' screams , she chokes . he had a thing about eyes , always the eyes -- stab their eyes . it 's the same guy . <person> was mydick . 
yes , with your clients ' names attached . that 's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world ! now , as i make it out , you 're doing me a favor ! 
who ? i don ’ t know who the fuck you ’ re talking about , sunshine . 
like a man . 
why did you call me ? 
like disposing of their wives ? 
listen , it sure did n't like this flamethrower . 
the < u > closet < /u > ? ! have you lost all sense of reality ? 
yeah . what 's your girlfriend 's name ? 
are you talking ? 
beck 's . 
am i s'posed to be grateful ? 
well , i would n't mind a quick chat , if you got the time . 
... <number> indians to fan me all night . the heat . 
oh , buddy-boy . i was just about to call you . i 'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall . you see , my little friend , she kept insisting <person> was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but i 'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil . 
it 's supposed to be <person> <person> . 
crawford has a proposition . i do n't think it 's a good idea . 
< u > no < /u > . if you do n't kill him instantly , i 'm dead and you 'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain , which is about the size of a cherry . and even if you < u > were < /u > on target , a bullet might not penetrate his hide . 
well , do n't let me keep you from anything . 
what do you want , < u > officer < /u > ? 
beavis . this is what it 's all about . 
no , i did not . must have been <person> at the hitching post . i think we mentioned it to him the first night . 
oh my god ! why did you tell me you only slept with <number> guys ? 
make sure there 's none on the threads , like this . now screw the end-cap on ... very gently . 
but i can throw it out of the window . 
you do n't know that . even i can not see their fate . 
but the police -- 
she back in kansas ? 
go to the northeast corner . call a cab . bring the pizza . then there 's a poem . roses are red , violets are blue , if the pope goes to washington , i would , too . 
you used to go out with him , you broke up with him ? 
you 're foreigners . 
i thought i would ask you a few questions if that 's okay . 
ha ha ha . ha ha ha . 
longer we hang around down here , <person> , better chance there is either <person> 's gon na fuck up the whole score , or we gon na get busted , or both . 
whenever you see someone who 's really messed up , especially amputees and retards . you give them money . but if it 's just a regular bum , you pass them by . 
< i > ... let 's draw straws. < /i > 
what about all these letters ? 
go on , <person> . i want to see it on you . 
you think so ? 
ah . 
we 've already got an ambulance on the way . do n't try to get out . 
no way . 
what ? 
<person> <person> , it 's time for you to get to bed ! 
why is this ? 
only respectful things . what did we have in common back then ... what kind of music did you like ... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar ... 
what 's he up to ? 
first i must visit my master 's grave . it 's been many years since <person> <person> murdered him . i have yet to avenge his death . and yet i 'm thinking of quitting . i must pray for his forgiveness . 
nazis ? ! -- is that the limit of your vision ? ! the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world . well , they 're welcome . but i want the grail itself . the cup that gives everlasting life . <person> can have the world , but he ca n't take it with him . i 'm going to be drinking my own health when he 's gone the way of the dodo . the grail is mine , and you 're going to get it for me . 
too bad . he called me up today , can you believe that ? i do n't know how he got my number . he asks me do i want to come over and see him , i tell him i 'd rather go to a leper colony . he says there 's a new gang that wants to kill him , take over the business . i told him i hope he 's right . that they kill him . that 's what i told him . 
what are you going to tell them ? that you 're protecting a man who 's killed <number> people ? 
... she fixes him pork chops and rice , the next thing you know they 're making love on the sofa . she says he was very gentle . 
how big it is ? 
what else ? from virginia ? 
why do n't you come to our house instead ? 
what 's the gimmick , <person> ? that 's the part i do n't get . you gon na hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? i did n't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche . 
the guy from near where <person> used to live ? 
because i do n't believe that <person> 's dead ! why , you said yourself you saw him last night . 
it 's doing what ? 
do n't try to con me , <person> . you knew how they got all those things . 
<person> -- 
did you buy the horse , papa ? 
all of them . 
i 've been to a few -- yes . 
bread is for peasants , and wine makes me sneeze . got any gumdrops ? 
he got him . he always does . eventually . 
how did it happen ? 
it works . 
no , do n't let her ! i 'll ... how about <person> ? <person> ? 
can i come with you ? 
blue . this blue . 
you really do n't remember the other night , do you ? 
<person> was such a beautiful man . no <number> knew him like i did ... excuse me . i ca n't do this now . i 'll call you tomorrow . 
were you with <person> ? or are you <number> still fighting ? 
i 'm not in this 'cause it 's fun . i 'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either ... i do it 'cause it works- ... 
you are not happy . tell me what is the matter ? 
all right , you raise the kids -- i 'll raise the roof . i 'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers , than expire in a pan of dirty dish water . 
to be honest , i do n't go to the pictures much , <person> <person> – 
you know , every year i throw this party , every year nobody helps me clear up . why am i yelling ? 
<number> minute . this is the beginning . we 're at ground zero . maybe you should say a few words , to mark the occasion . 
in the papers . i do n't tear out the articles . i would n't want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid . you want to know how he 's choosing them , do n't you ? 
nothing . 
those creatures he keeps talking about ... we 'd better double the security ... <person> , i do n't know how ... 
what did they say ? 
cool off , beautiful . did n't you see the sign says `` <person> <person> ? '' there 's a war on , you know ? 
buy and - sell ? no , no , pardon me , exchange . 
you realize that in order to do that , we 'd actually have to play the game . 
we can see each other , we can even have dinner ... but respectably , in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for <number> ! 
the young girl runs by a window . she looks in . a ghost masked killer stares back . the figure crashes through the window attacking her . she fights him off , getting away , running ... 
get away from me ... get away ! she means that much to you , you stay with her . but you come back , you come back for me . not for <person> , not for your mother , or your fucking job , but for me . 
this <number> 's different . no one can trace it . it 's out there somewhere in the matrix and it 's growing stronger ... infecting other computer systems like a virus . 
listen . 
so i should feel happy that he got away with it ? 
i do n't know . 
there 's a lot of valuable shit in there , applejack . the silver and the china . the crystal . and the grandfather clock . <person> , i bet that clock 's worth <number> grand . 
... where 're we goin ' ? 
and live in what , our station wagon ? 
what you got in there , warshing ? 
no , <person> . you know i would n't break my promise . 
i got ta use the phone . 
i 'll pay extra 
no way , josè .

we are ... 
where 's <person> ? 
horror show . what 'd you do tonight ? 
what 's this ? 
it 's easy to be dedicated , when you care about something ... 
the guy with the transplant . 
what if i were to say `` your wife '' -- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel ? 
it 's important to observe everything . 
ethan , you know what frightens me most when i 'm with him ? ..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here ? 
but it 'll stop the movie . 
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen . 
old wives ' tales , born of envy and jealousy ! and a phobia against truth ! 
`` dear detectives , long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . '' it 's the murderer 's way of announcing himself . 
stuttering -- 
which island of hawaii do you want our house to be on ? maui ? kaui ? molokai ?

uh-huh .

that 's government property , major . 
you 're a filthy , rotten bastard . 
no , she did it . she killed the cheatin ' wife , too . 
it 's an appearance . it has nothing to do with support . i do n't even like him .

well ... can we come up and have a look ?

in so far as i can tell these things -- no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly . 
it 's getting cold . 
it probably will . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will , in time . why should i settle for that ? 
how apropos . 
did n't you just see her lookin ' at him ? she told me no , but i do n't believe her . 
what have they been doing to you ? 
what ? 
she 's next . in <number> or <number> more minutes she 'll be free .

well , we 're in pursuit of a green <person> ... 
i do n't want to know -- 
... are you <person> ... ? 
well . i hear you 've been right on your toes since you got here . pitching right in . lots of people took you for dumb -- but they 're wrong . you 're smart . in fact , *i* think you 're smart enough to understand a situation when it 's explained to you -- 
willya lem me talk for <person> ? i 'm trying to tell you what happened . what happened is ... 
we 'll be going to warp speed --

told that 's what our old man was . planned on going to sea , me and <person> , 'til i read <person> <person> . started trapping when i was ten . mailed the furs to sears . eight bucks for a skunk , <number> for a muskrat . that was fine money . 
the sewers . of course . 
<person> man , i did n't mean that personally ... 
what , baby ? 
i do n't really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things . my room is right above my father 's office . the ear , there 's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear , and it did come off a living person . that 's direct from the coroner 's office . the person is unknown . there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on , but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear . i heard some of the same names . 
yeah , an ' i 'm tellin ' ya , she 's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out ... <person> , who wants a card ? 
quite right , but we still make the rules . 
i was n't sure you caught that . 
i think he was sleeping with <person> , too . 
uh ... hi . uh ... <person> 's stepmother told me i 'd find her here ? 
i 'm not surprised . it 's got a body count of zero . and no one goes around in a stupid mask , hacking innocent people to death . 
yes ? 
j & b . <person> . 
you kidding ? i got an unbelievable story here , <person> . un-believable . <person> . it 's the cops , i know it . the chief ! and they 're all over frank . 
anyone at home ? 
do n't know about any of that . suppose nobody does . 
wait a minute . 
focus all your powers on me , rowan until it is done . only me ... 
nah , nuthin ' on my end -- 
thanks . 
flynn , we 've got to help him ! 
what do you want ? 
and now these <number> remain : faith , hope and love . but the greatest of these is love . who gives this girl in marriage ? 
and he never knew , and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart ? that would be all right , would n't it ? 
do n't you think you 'd like to go back to detecting once in a while , just for the fun of it ? 
no , stay . please stay with me . 
the middle colonies ? 
if it 's that easy why does n't everybody grow them ? 
it 's in the process . 
hello ! it 's anchorage ! <person> ! 
as much as i want . when these plants bud i 'll probably have about <number> <number> dollars worth of weed . 
cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are . you got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand . 
who 's controlling your mind ? 
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body . where has it been laid out ? 
you 're right ! 
she took something from the house . what she called a medicine bundle . most likely <person> 's . 
knowledge . 
a name . <person> . nothing . and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing . then they asked me , well had i been getting letters , from someone out there in cabbageville -- 
you 'd look naked without <number> . 
yes . on the texas border . some kind of experiment . something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks . 
they did n't take the silverware ? 
um , well ... 
for the last time <person> ! ! ! what do those guns mean ? ? ! ! 
yes , that 's true , but he refused to give the nazi salute . he kept his baton in his right hand . in hitler 's presence . that was a brave act ... 
no ! 
shhh . he 'll hear you . 
again , i thank you . 
how 'm i doing , boss ? 
captain , the enterprise ! 
i wonder . 
what ? right . so let 's start counting . 
yes , sir . 
but it 's not just those legs . it 's that nose of yours i 'm crazy about . that cute little button of a nose ! 
telling my mother she doesn ’ t have to stay with the kids . 
i do n't believe you , rebel . where are your headquarters ? on the mainland ? 
... maybe . i mean you got ta hide all the lights ... 
any ghosts in here ? 
she said she 's got to be home by <number> . 
you look awful good in that uniform , though . 
perhaps i have a way to bring <number> here . 
monkeybone ... ! ? 
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend . 
bobby -- ! what are you doing up at this hour ? 
you 're here with me , you 're already on the hook for <number> . <person> <person> , you get the rest for the same price . you know that . 
i feel the need , the need for speed . i 'm driving out of myself . 
maybe the voice is n't <person> <person> . maybe that 's your roommate or if it is <person> <person> she can tell you who you are . 
even your play . 
you were married ? all those falls , i 'm surprised you had time . 
well , you know , i think everyone 's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young . 
flip . you 're the closest thing i got to a friend around here . tell me something . you think i 'm crazy ? 
game over , bitch ! 
it literally is <person> ... 
i saw you on your bike today . 
yeah . 
yes , but the curtains were drawn . 
what about her ? 
let 's have a rundown on the damage , <person> ? 
then let 's talk about something else ... 
they 're -- -- what ? 
we 'll shoot this with an .18 , boys . 
put me on the payroll , find out , find out wassup -- 
yes , matter of fact . the wife 's taking a nap and ... i can never keep quiet enough for her ... so i thought i 'd look you up and ... talk . 
maxie says he runs a tight ship . i would n't fuck with him . 
yes , i feel their spirits . <person> ... <person> ... i am here to communicate ... 
you have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time . tie their hands , boys . 
got a meeting uptown . 
what do you mean by that ? 
it 's not a mixer . it 's the senior dance . and it 's important . you would n't understand . 
okay , um , there 's <number> that goes `` blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders . '' 
who is this person that you 've found ? 
what for ? 
i ai n't sleepy . 
she 's my date tonight . what do you want her to do -- bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump ? bugger off ! <person> <person> what he thinks . your mother looks beautiful -- right ? kid ? does n't your mother look nice ? <person> ? 
uh-huh . 
this is <person> . see if you can guess his specialty . 
you ca n't end up with <person> because it goes totally against everything you 're about . 
then you 've heard too . 
a fanciful idea , <person> <person> . 
what hope is there ? a wartime commission can not be vacated except by the king , and what chance is there of that ? fromberge is on the battle line , and raoul -- 
no . it 's the truth . 
and the blood let you out ? 
that 's okay . 
i fucked up . 
dr. sutphin is your wife a big reader ? 
too fast . too many moving parts . 
she 's the pilot , she should stay close to the cells . 
no , <person> , you should n't touch her . 
i 'm sorry about that . have you found anything out ? you 've got to tell me . 
zion ? 
good . 
a simple exchange , <person> <person> . <person> releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the wall of the lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side . 
i ca n't give up looking for her , mrs. redi , no matter what you 're hinting at . 
yeah . 
from you , pard ? never . thanks for the graduation present . 
you can be goddamn sure , though , i 'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when i get back to baltimore -- i get proof who stole my shit and i call the cops ! 
man , what 's this about ? ya know , you were robbing a store . it was n't personal . it was his job . 
what does she want ? 
father - may i ask you a question in private ? 
do n't touch it . and for <person> , try not to sweat . they can sense chemical changes ... 
i am so sorry . 
what did i fuckin ' do ? ... in the middle of the lakeview . 
so you made it . 
it 's the least i could do ... considering i got you into this mess with those reports . 
yeah , and you drank yours like it was orange juice . he loved that about you . 
'take your car ? ' 
those look heavy . where 's <person> ? 
look , reese , i know you want to help , but ... 
you 're in it up to your ass , <person> . you 're an accessory . you talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case . 
it 's spectacular . 
you mean they knew who i was ? 
one-three zebra . <person> <person> , i need you . 
and what had you done ? 
but they 're certainly dead . and yes , personally , i find it a bit odd . 
i guess . i 've got an ego same as any man . 
when 'd you get back ? 
is n't this fun ! 
hey , <person> ! i got a deal for you . suppose you help us escape . we 'll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden . for the world championship ! <person> , the beast of bavaria versus <person> <person> ! 
seven eighty-five out of twenty . <person> care of yourself now , and do n't do anything i would n't do . 
he asked where you were ! he wants you with him . 
i was heading back to my garage . it 's on the way . 
nooo ! 
dream come true , hunh ? 
you wanted to get the truth . 
you ca n't know for sure , how can you ? i mean , you 're not him . 
permant cortex bond . 
i told you i do n't know anything about any fucking set up . i 've only been on the force <number> months , nobody tells me anything ! i do n't know anything ! you can torture me if you want - 
gentlemen , i am now free to announce ... ... that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated . 
there must be somebody else up here . i ca n't believe that he 's -- 
julia ? 
... so what does all that add up to ? 
with applesauce ? 
you a sailor man ? that 'd be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile . 
grace ... 
i was downtown looking for a ... a friend . a guy i know . anyway , there was this store . like real old ? lotsa weird shit in there . i saw this statue . <person> . thing . i knew he 'd love it . you 've seen the club . 
course he ai n't never killed nobody . why 'd you say that , <person> ? 
you wonít regret this , sir . 
what did you tell her about the shop for ? 
oh yeah ... 
no way . 
have n't you been listening to a fuckin ' word i said ? ... oh , i 'm sorry . can i say fuckin ' ? i ca n't , can i ? 
no ! no ! no ! 
who 's <person> ? 
roki has a vivid imagination . 
you know who it once belonged to ? 
there is , but it 's not that interesting . 
not much . 
my wife ... <person> freezes . 
... he 's the producer of the movie . 
we 've got a - 
you did n't take it before . you did n't take it the time after that . and now , you did n't take it again ? 
we have a new directive . i 'm taking over . 
and if english law can not be trusted , maybe these people would do better makin ' a peace with the french ! 
that 's temporary . 
you wanted it turned off . there 's no such thing as a good fire . people get burned up . they ca n't breathe . 
those fools and their torches ! do you have any ointment ? 
i was wondering , how are you planning to beat the security ? 
i did it myself . i read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces . 
ash , you 've gotten me enough -- 
your gun . 
got you . 
settle down . i have a plan which i think will work . there is very little for you to do , but i do need your help . .are n't you curious about my plan ? 
is there anything that can stop it ? 
something like that . 
is <person> <person> of your animals ? 
we 're not doing it ! i 'm not even sure it 's christian . 
you ai n't heard from him ? 
well ... yeah , it 's rubber . it stretches . 
i have an idea working in my head ... 
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , <person> and <person> were dead , and <person> was running out the door with the smoking gun -- 
i just need to lie down for awhile 
fuck you . ok , so <person> 's got the virus . <person> news , big deal . the gig goes on , or had n't you noticed ? swanney fucks his leg up . well , tough shit , but it could have been worse . 
ready , darling ? 
<person> <person> . <person> <person> . u.s. army . serial number , 21-31-2841-262 . 
would you like to learn them ? 
you 'd cut me loose , <person> ? 
i 'm going to take you to the home to see the girl ... 
what do you mean , `` what ? '' 
all i want is thirty-nine sixty . if you 'll give me a check i 'll get out of this place . it gives me the jitters . 
ever since <person> , you 've been different . kind of distracted , distant . but i feel like you 're coming back from wherever you were . 
<person> corleone is <person> 's godfather . that is very close , a very sacred religious relationship . 
utah ? 
this is mrs. redi , <person> . 
i 'm sorry , <person> <person> , not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation , at this point in your career it 'd be tantamount to suicide . 
now listen , ann—he ca n't possibly get in without our seeing him . i 'm watching the side door and the colonel 's out front , so stop worrying . 
a <number> apiece , something like that . there 's <number> of us . and we each kick in a <number> a week for beer and cleaning , stuff like that . 
you need n't see anybody . you can come directly to my study . i 'd appreciate it very much if— 
i do n't want to do something anybody can do . 
it wo n't look pretty good on your record , killaine . where 's the girl now ? 
almost got me in billings . i saw you there , shooting at me . 
<person> mrs. thorwald 's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag . during that phone conversation he held up <number> rings -- <number> with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and <number> plain gold band . 
hello , halberstam . nice tie . how the hell are you ? 
what ? 
well ... no . 
it is your evil , who will be sought by us . 
i still ca n't believe <person> 's gone . 
what question ? 
that depends on who `` they '' were . 
all right , <person> . go ahead . call the boyds ... <number> ... see if their darling <person> has left . 
i do n't know what else you 'd call it . he 's breathing on his own , but his pupils are completely blown out . he 's totally unresponsive to pain . what happened up there ? 
<person> . come on . the question . the question you 've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning . the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself -- 
hurts . hurts pretty bad . 
bullshit a little . you lied to me . 
okay . 
if the constitution is ratified ... we 'll have a country . they 'll want to elect you president of the convention , which means president of the country . 
they found another note ? 
muggers ? ! <person> , are you all right ? what happened ? 
we 've got rope ? 
listen , do n't let it get you down . you 're going to be fine . 
schumann . we 're gon na go pick him up tonight . 
you got to be kidding me . 
never ? 
a ford ... we have a ford . 
the teeth , were they ... 
you do n't want to know . now , wes , leave , please . for me . 
and all these rooms here ? 
i 've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow . 
i 'm gon na start rolling -- 
insane ... ? 
you 're saying stay away from him . 
i 'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now . 
this can be your room if you want it . what do you say ? 
what , want a glass ? 
what ? what do n't i get ? what do n't i get ? 
i 'm getting to your rug . my father and i do n't get along ; he does n't approve of my lifestyle and , needless to say , i do n't approve of his . still , i hardly wish to make my father 's embezzlement a police matter , so i 'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to . 
every time you 're on television i get mentioned . that looks bad . that looks bad . 
that was our assessment as well . 
like what ? 
are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find the city of the dead ? truly ? 
all right , scooby , let 's not beat around the bush . with your attitude , you 're not going to get in anywhere . 
yes . 
whatever it is , it must be common on the tepui . <person> used it as packing material . 
it 's a beautiful dress ... 
why , do you think ? 
no , it 's not . now i get to pitch . 
your body is the temple of the lord . 
that was the first and last question -- now only answers . where 's the chopper ? 
hey , doc . <person> wan na ... 
you 're in love with the fucking housekeeper ! 
okay ... dead or undead ... what do you want from me ? 
shit . you better tell me something . 
<number> ... 
a virtuoso rendition . tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of <person> <person> ' haunting , moody piece . 
please do not be frightened , <person> . 
so far ? 
i been thinking . 
do n't you have a real story to write ? why are n't you in latin america ? 
you sound like <person> <person> . 
havana . 
and the snakes ? you want to know about the snakes ? you saw <number> outside earlier , did n't you ? when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified . 
what 'd you bit me for ! ! 
ca n't remember ? ... what do you mean ? 
wendy ... 
it 's hard to find . it 's an old civil war cemetery . nobody ever goes there . so ... what is it you say you do ? 

do you promise ? i would n't want to die here . i would n't want to die in the desert . i 've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind , with particular hymns . very english . and i know exactly where i want to be buried . in our garden . where i grew up . with a view of the sea . so promise me you 'll come back for you . 
what are you talking about ? 
what ? 
who is this ? are you sure we can trust him ? 
six weeks and no sex ? 
i think you 'd look good in red . 
you keep asking me why i 'm here . 
you miss him , do n't you ? 
-- you finished the film on your own terms , that 's what matters . did you really do all the post yourself ? 
i did n't want to eat this much , man . 
what . 
i like the way you handled that . well , how does it feel to be an executive ? 
i got ta get out of here . 
i ’ ve scheduled a medical for you . 
did you tell walter ? 
there 's a bathroom upstairs . 
at least they were n't lit . 
you ever actually been in there , <person> ? 
... yes , i am , <person> . 
do n't you understand ? ! that thing did n't want to become a dog ... 
faulty wiring . 
i love you . 
jesus ! 
<person> , call for back-up . <person> , you all right ? 
they never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers . what if breuning and <person> took them from the evidence room ? couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or <number> . 
uh , no ... just seeing you standing there , it reminded me ... there 's a word for it ... 
and get someone to help around the house . 
did you see how i did that ? <person> was n't it ? 
why ? 
uh-huh . all i know is - the sun rises in the east , and we 're going away from it . 
they tore my legs off , and they threw them over there ! then they took my chest out , and they threw it over there ! 
he 's getting away ! he was at my mercy ! 
no way , old buddy . 
will you come with me ? 
you be our guest , <person> . 
why not ? i mean , i 'm having fun ... at least i 'm not bitching . 
well , i 'm sorry . 
yeah , well -- 
goodbye , goodbye , goodbye . 
i 've got some good news . 
did you think <person> was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel ? i 've had some practice in the art . 
i 'll make it up to you this summer . i promise . 
who else knows ? 
this track alone by <person> <person> is worth about $ <number> if you have the original <number> . she was <number> of the greatest guitar players that ever lived , and a great singer and songwriter as well . i know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue . 
i mean , most of the time <person> 's really sweet , but sometimes he gets kind of ... 'me-tarzan'ish , you know what i mean ? lately it bugs me , i guess . <person> ? are you still breathing ? 
because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' . 
the fight 's set -- i do n't need a manager . 
but . he was a night < u > watchman < /u > . that 's what he was . n'they brought back , his hat , his < u > badge < /u > , an his < u > timeclock < /u > . n'then they took me off . i < u > saw < /u > ... i saw . clear as day , do you , do they call it a < u > delusion < /u > ? his hat an his badge . clear as day , bulletholes and all . 
<person> thorpey ? have n't seen him in a long time . 
i do n't get it . 
think about it . on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years , do n't you think ? . you took my mother , so i took yours . big sympathy factor . maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior . it certainly fucked you up . it made you have sex with a psychopath . 
i have work ... . 
`` the show must go on . '' 
is n't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought ? 
i do n't want to fight either . look ... uh -- i love you . 
this is it . a golden opportunity . <person> can ask katarina to the party . 
i do n't want to marry him . i do n't want to get married now . i 'm on the verge of graduation . i want to go to grad school after this . and then i want to start a career . i do n't want to be a wife first , and then have to worry about when i 'm going to fit in all of the other stuff . i 've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife . and i know that 's what i 'd become . <person> 's already signed with a major firm , and he 's going to be pulling a huge salary , which would give me no reason to work , and he 's so traditional anyway ... 
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly . 
see you later . 
forget it . i 've been thinking . <person> must go through that stuff too . sometimes when i look at you i feel like an animal . maybe my dad 's right . teenagers are nuts . 
they 'll be back . he had to go in for a urinalysis . 
i have something to tell you . 
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt . you had sex last night and you feel guilty . 
i said let me see your hands now ! 
well , look , i have to go . got ta ' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education . 
like what ? 
i do n't know who they 've left out there to do the work . there ca n't be <number> mine left open . have they touched the women ? 
yeah ? 
jesus , are the questions too tough for you already ? let 's try again -- is your name <person> ? 
there 's nothing else for it . take your ground , grogan -- twelve paces , i suppose ? 
yay . meet me after work by the old mill . 
does this room look silly ? 
he 's been like that for awhile . we need to get him some medicine . 
okay , young lady , that 's it . 
lenny ? you 're an asshole . 
maybe we oughta be going , what do you think ? 
he 's not dead , <person> . he 's just a little understandab1y , < u > fatigued < /u > . <person> 's get him to some help ... 
i know i was n't a good husband , <person> , but you can always count on me . 
ai n't your fault . 
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep . 
but you eat , do n't you ? 
where 's the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it 's really just a springboard . it needs work . 
why her ? 
yes . like that . 
dignan , it 's got an alarm . 
i see . 
you think things would be any different now ? 
dad , what 's going on ? 
no , i do n't think you can < u > do < /u > that , <person> ... 
say what , cap'n ? 
how the hell are we gon na get outta here ? 
after he gets a blow job , he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing . it 's called snowballing . 
what he went through in < u > <person> < /u > ... 
was she ever a suspect ? 
harvey says he 's amazing . 
... -er . 
calm yourself , doctor , the operation is almost complete ... 
what 's he in for ? 
what did he say ? tell me ! 
i warn you , i can yell awfully loud . 
i ca n't stay , i just came to read my poem . 
they wo n't get a conviction . the husband called it in as a suicide . the forensic guys were n't thinking murder . i 'm sure some of the evidence was compromised . 
i sold them to <person> <person> . 
but you say he has n't shown up , you think he backed out ? 
how did she.. ? 
admiral on the bridge ! 
but , <person> , i 'm sorry . believe me . i was fucking crazy . but i 'm okay now . i can be trusted . i 'm clean now . on my children . believe me ! <number> weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together ... 
i was on that side , the shadow was on that side , and no turnings on either side . 
i 'll make sure she does . but first i 'm going make up a nice , big breakfast against that cold outside . 
i always thought you knew it was me . 
we 're within visual range of the energy distortion , captain . 
is that so ? well , have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph ? 
look -- this is n't my apartment , and there is n't anybody else here . mrs. ryan wo n't be home for a while . 
there 's nothing we can do . 
here ! i 've got an order ! let me have ... 
the movie star ? 
yeah . 
i made no request to go out riding today . how long has he been there ? 
would n't i . just watch me . 
you got me . 
you know what i mean babe , it 's enough . we can stop . 
we 're going to do this . 
i came within about ten yards of you . you know something , <person> , the way we been going , if we ever got to see a real golf course again , i bet we could burn it up . 
how could i ever leave ? 
detroit . <person> <person> told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash . 
just shows you how wrong a guy can be . <person> ? 
i love you man 
i have been patient and i 've tried to help , but you would n't even let me do that . 
you left your husband 's side ? you left your brother 's wedding ? 
why do n't we go over to the theatre and see what 's really happening ? after all , we 've only heard from a small portion of the audience . let 's hear what the majority thinks . 
ippolito ! get back here ! 
well , in reality it 's not that dangerous , <person> . it 's only dangerous if you do n't know what you 're doing . 
where 's your pet gorilla and the female <person> <person> ? 
i 've ah ... got some other stuff to tell him anyway , so it 's no problem . i 'll just tell him about , you know , <person> , when i tell him the other stuff . 
where is she ? 
a month from today ? 
jack ... oh , <person> ... help me ... 
when was he ... created ? 
my old man was a marine . he enlisted the day he turned seventeen . 
you 've been so quiet lately , <person> , i thought you no longer cared . 
so why the long face ? 
it 's gone . i feel it ! 
richie ! she spent <number> months dating a criminal

<person> goes to a great school .

<person> left ? 
why do we need you ? you only come between us . we can be the smartest person in gotham city . we want the empire for ourselves . <person> 's up , laughing boy .

i think so . 
that 's it . 
am i dead , <person> ? am i dead ? 
hires you for what ? 
to our brave guests . few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes . we are blessed to count ourselves among them . 
i 'm all for them owning casinos , getting rich off the white man 's greed . it 's a beautiful piece of irony , is n't it , wesley ? 
may god make safety your companion . 
shut up ! 
how do you know ? they might . 
what do you think ? 
nope . not handsome at all . 
... fired ... your fired ... your fired . you understand ? ! fired ! ! 
yes it is . 
no , the less mystifying . <person> and evil are only illusions . there is no such thing as evil with a capital `` e. '' that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings . 
bitch , bitch , bitch ! 
now i 'll ask you another . you think i got no contacts out here ? that nag paid off at just the opening price . there was n't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted . there ai n't enough action to tickle the tote , but you claim a ten grand win ! you send me ten <number> dollars , like i 'm some mark you can blow off ! 
that was n't bullshit , i said we love each other . 
you okay ? 
i 've had enough of this shit . you 're on foot , <person> . 
what did he mean ? 
what ? 
<person> a.t.f . they might give you permission . 
hi , <person> . this is my eighth and final call ... 
we have more in common than you think , <person> dear . i loved summer camp when i was young and i love it now . it 's important . between school , family , friends , pot , playstations , basic cable , and the goddamn internet , it 's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul . out here , in nature , away from the shit , surrounded by reminders of who i once was ... i get recharged . now who 's the dork ? 
what < u > are < /u > you interested in ? 
that 's what you said the other night . 
i have to have <person> ask me ? do n't you think you could call me and let me know ? look at my hair . 
waiting -- i 'm waiting for news from manchester . 
of course you 're going to deny it . you want to blame someone else . you want to blame <person> . because you hate <person> . 
thank you . 
how could it happen to everybody 's watch together ? 
the police still have a lot of questions for russell nash . 
let 's retrofit the dish to another satellite .

... do n't worry . i 'm not the man that 's after you . 
he 'll see right through it . 
nothing . 
i did n't ask <person> to invite you . 
it 's in the report . 

-- sir ? -- 
the theological ramifications of all this are obvious ; the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them . she 's also named <person> <person> as their liaison ; he 's requested a meeting with you . 
that is simple , is n't it ? i assume you can prove that if necessary . 
no wine . 
oh . 
then , you also understand that you must die . 
come on . 
i know you 're thinkin ' that i got more'n some of my mama in me ? well , i could n't help it . <person> , i really could n't . i 'm sorry for that guy , but when he pulled that drippin ' hunk of awful-smellin ' meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies ! 
do n't be a fool . i loved him . he was n't worth it , but i loved him . 
you ca n't fit in here -- i ca n't fit in there . according to you , people should be born , live an die on the same -- 
what we going to do ? ! 
you certainly have not , <number> . you 've been very helpful , and you 've shown a genuine desire to reform . 
this weekend . 
you 'd do the newspaper right here . 
i never met anyone from seattle before . 
oh , hi , elaine . 
a tibanna gas mine . <person> won it in a sabacc match , or so he claims . <person> and i go way back . 
i 've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father . i 've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but i need <number> more for my father . i 've been trying all the firms , the shops ... 
are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ? 
how 's the patient ? 
he kept it in the side table in the front hallway . he showed me . i visited a few times . then <number> of <person> 's guys visited . when i arrived , your dad was dying . 
cops ? you mean they nabbed those cruds ? 
she said you told her in every letter how much you loved her , how you wanted to marry her , have children with her ... 
boy , look at all those stars . bet you can see every star there is . practical touch 'em . <person> makes you think , you know ? i mean you look up and you think <person> made all that but he still remembered to make a little speck like me . kinda flattering really . hey , <person> , you believe in god ? no , come on , really , do you ? 
yeah . 
are you my attorney ? i 'm <person> . i 'm insane . 
you 're the one who 's helping *me* , homer . you 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while i 'm gone . <person> , too . 
betty , it 's imperative we get <person> out of flavors ' fast fingers and <person> out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever . if only i could place that name -- mckinley ? 
<person> , just because you saved my butt , does n't mean it 's yours . 
i 've talked nonsense . i 've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me , i always felt that good held the balance of power . 
just some flies . 
i know , dad . 
scott ... 
i ... i did n't think you would have any interest in this get together ... i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you -- it 's not like a real party or anything . 
proprietor of a london firm . of longstanding . 
you 'd be surprised what all you can get , you ask for it the right way . 
pelting down out there . 
here , here , here , now ! do n't you go back to work on me , too . i 'm getting tired of this . besides , it 's beginning to affect your looks— 
but is she gon na be okay ? 
all right . let 's take it off now .

melanie , <person> ...

what is that to you ... ? 
<person> <person> , eh ? what do you want ? 
she is gone ! 
that 's ironic . because we 're here to protect her from you . 
then you 're lucky i came along . does n't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this . now help me out of this trunk . 
yes .

luke , you probably do n't remember me , <person> <person> , i 'm the grocer here in town . 
this an invite to a necktie party , <person> ? 
physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation . 
well , he 's taken care of . <person> <number> hot dog . 
he might be . i do n't know . 
look , <person> . we got ta go straight . this is all messed up ... 
it 's a short word . 
hey , <person> , stop cryin ' . you do n't have to cry ... you ai n't got nothin ' to be ashamed of . she ai n't gon na tell you mother ... stop crying ...

i wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere .

look , listen to me . a woman is dying - my wife ! - is dying seventy miles from here . i have been walking for <number> days ! i do n't want to spell my name , i want you to give me this jeep ! 
i 've been thinking about it , that 's all . 
that 's an agent . <person> 's get fifteen percent . 
i think i lost a week 's salary at the dart board . 
they 're tight . 
the hotel . 
what did you find ? 
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash . 
oh ! uh , i hope i did n't offend you . 
it 's alright janet . everything 's going to be alright . 
well , uh ... 
i should quit this job . i 'm going to get so fat working here ... nobody will ever take me out . 
look - let me talk to her . any leads i get , they 're all yours . just let me have a first crack at her . 
aw , he is n't that good ... ! 
he 's missing . he 's gone . he left . 
i do n't reckon i know . 
do you want to fuck me up the ass , boy ? is that why you called me a 'ewe ' ? are you a queer ? 
she 's really cute and she 's really nice . 
all right . then let 's eliminate the symptom for the time being . 
i used a variation . you should have anticipated that . have you figured out the message ? 
specialty store down in sacramento . 
i am . 
worrying - clicking - picking - you may as well be back in los angeles . 
is it the medicine that 's making you thirsty ? 
the war pulled poetry out of some of us . others it affected differently . this is me a few years later . we 're in india , by the way , and it 's <number> . i was like many survivors . lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification . we 'd seen god fail , you see . so many dead . for us god , too , fell at flanders . we adjusted to the loss . and if we mourned , we mourned in silence . thousands drank themselves to death . others went further . i went further . i thought i was a lost soul . but , until this frozen moment , i did n't even know what the phrase meant . 
<person> ! what have i done ? 
did they ... ? 
now i 
oh ! you 're here . 
i was , because if you said `` yes '' right away , i would n't get to say this next part . and i 've been practicing it . <person> ? 
'big ' ? 
hey , brat— ! the view moves to the rear door of the bus . <person> stands on the bottom step . 
anchor ? 
for <number> who calls himself a federalist , your mouth reeks of republican liberalism . 
i 'm between jobs right now . my last job ... it ... the person i was working for ... the job ended . over . so ... and you ? 
will i go crazy or something ? 
you tell me , <person> . what do i do ? 
she is a true psychic . she sees beyond the relativity of time . for her there is no past , present or future . there is only what is . 
what 's it smell like ? 
go ? where ? 
i am not a doctor . 
do you find me stubborn ? 
very noble . not smart , but noble . 
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet <person> -- i wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement .

i do n't think she 's such hot stuff . 
yessir . 
fellas .

what if i did take them ? i 'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours ... . 
if i had died yesterday , you 'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence . 
did you call that radio station again ? 
hi vada , can you come out ? 
what sort of task ? 
besides , dad would have freaked . 
<person> 's getting out . i got him a pardon . 
i 'm sure they will . 
why ? 
this is n't an animal , vince . i 've been on this case <number> months , remember ? i 've learned a few things . 
i 'm going to find out . 
stop talking like that ! 
this is the job . it 's not an easter egg hunt . 
i know he 's out , but how 's he doing ? 
i hate to think where that puts me . i could be her father . 
... and this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you ? as your father ? 
tell me again how it started . 
i do n't want to go -- 
sounds like a game show host to me . 
that 's <person> over there . 
i did n't say anything to them . 
i must be insane . leaving work , ditching cops . all to follow a murderer . a very old murderer , but a murderer just the same . 
butter-fingers ! i give you an old lady to take somewhere , and you hand her over to the cops ! 
i 'm a bit of a slob myself . 
she jumped . she 'd been depressed .

'methodology and techniques of anesthesiology . ' yes . 
so what was all this -- some sort of test ?

lula ! ! ! ! 
i 've never been in an apartment above a store . you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them . 
you with the cops ? 
do you have t.p. ? t.p . for my bunghole ? 
a move ? 
dial someone else , okay ? 
but i did leave you , <person> <person> -- that 's just the trouble . and i tried to get back for days and days . 
what do you mean ? 
it was like sex . what else could it be like ? 
cannon or gatling ? 
he reminds me of you before you got old and ugly . 
you 've known him long ? 
i want to thank you . 
even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain .

what 's interesting about a butcher 's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper ? 
he 's working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested , analyzed before -- 
if she runs , then it 's a cover story . all true . all accurate . 
huh ? 
it can be done . take <number> days to shop ; <number> to prep . i 'll offer up my bible for a small fee . you also have to hope <person> 's jerk-circus did n't undo <person> 's linkage so much so that he 's setting up surveillance teams on every city block . and then get yourself a crew ... 
you bet . 
accidents . <person> . each of your prior wives , so we 've been informed .

where did you hear that name ?

what is it , <person> ? 
i 'm surprised at you , <person> . if there 's anything certain ; certain in life ; if history has taught us anything , it 's that you can kill ... anybody . but perhaps your relucatance is because you 've come to tell me that you 're moving your family to vegas , that you 've been offered the vice-presidency of the houstan hotels there . or were n't you going to tell me at all ?

got a cause ? 
<person> police . i 'm a policeman now , can you believe it ? 
apparently i 've overlooked this <number> piece of it , and i 'd like to remedy that . you see , in order for the town to be preserved , the trust must own it in its entirety . 
homer , do n't you know what business you in ? you do n't wan na go into no business with me , homer -- ai n't that right ? 
well , <person> & <person> 's , that 's closer ta <person> <person> , so i made that assumption .

yup . so i 've been playing with this italian club the last <number> years . 
you know , my dad 's done some work for <person> ... 
ok . it 's a strange world , <person> . this is what i have found out . what i think i have found out . <person> <person> is married to a man named <person> . they have a son . i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named <person> who has now cut off both of <person> 's ears . i think he is holding them to make her do things for him . i think she wants to die . the ears were for her a warning to stay alive . there is another man involved . i call him the `` yellow man '' . you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door . i do n't know what he does but i think he 's on drugs supplied by <person> . <person> is a very dangerous man . 
it has to do with my father .

the word is out in the streets that he 's dead . 
allo ... salvatore ... 
i thought so , i noticed your name when you were announced . i 'm corsican too -- my name is <person> . 
that wall is going to need something . maybe we could put our first family picture there . 
when a man has no profession except the one he loathes , what 's left ? i began looking for people with more money than they 'd ever need -- including some they 'd barely miss . 
that never seemed to worry you at the glades . 
what are you doing ? 
elope ? but there are laws - conventions - 
but he was just another feller , was n't he ? 
okay , chewie , it 's now or never . 
uh , we got a problem here . 
what the hell are you talking about ? what 's happening . 
a fairy godmother , all of your own . are n't you lucky ?

<person> ' little circles with his bread . 
where the hell are you ? 
it 's a simple question . 
i ai n't drunk , honey . 
he was watching a ball game on television . 
that 's it ? 
no . it happened when <person> went to see <person> ' daughter <number> months later in the hospital . she saved her carotid artery.. , but lost <number> fingers and her larynx . she was connected up to a voice box . when <person> went to see her , she asked him -- through the speaker : 'why did you have to kill my daddy ? ' that 's when <person> had his nervous breakdown . 
no . you ’ ll be safe here . 
well , wait a minute , will you ? i 'm in conference . 
because i am holding all the western territories hostage , <person> <person> ! a town a day will disappear ! <person> was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , i level all of <person> ! yes , that 's right . only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own president will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire ! 
<person> , i 'm askin ' you to trust me on this . 
he 's got my grandson , sanchez . 
what happened ? 
what the hell 're you talking about ? 
other than that ... you all right ? 
<number> -- <number> -- 
well , sure , we can leave it up . 
aha . the lovers . 
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza . i got you <number> of each . he likes to cold deck low , <number> 's or <number> 's . 
you 've got a generous nature . i like that in a person . my name is <person> . 
this pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built ? <number> bucks she wanted . <number> of us made a deal for , twenty-five , see , big goddam bargain ?

we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here . 
would you like something to eat ? 
no -- you have n't time -- you have n't time for your mother , or your wife , or your child . 
... <person> . i can barely hear you . 
this is it . i 'm in hell . damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation . 
it 's all there . 
now . 
did you bring the pie and punch ? 
it 's not the place . i do n't buy that . trapped in the same town forever . the price she would pay for her teenage lust . 
karen ... ... you wo n't forget , will you ? what we talked about before ? 
and <person> <person> . 
i never had a really real pair before . 
keep your friends close and your enemies closer . when i get through with her , she 'll be the premier <person> <person> <person> of the tri-state area and poor little court 's heart will be shattered . 
whatiya mean ? 
i thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the rtd of - 
oh , okay . here it comes . 
shut up and drive ! 
it 's the only way . 
ridiculous . that answer is a contradiction in terms . tell us , <person> <person> , why do men have no souls ? what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain ? 
you do ? 
maybe he got some definite lead . maybe he went right on ... 
maybe i should come up with you . 
the coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict ? 
she 's fine . well , actually we 've broken up . it 's all over .

you wrote me a letter . very cordial . very appropriate . 
and you saw a shape ahead of you ... 
why are you trying to kill me ? 
that woman . the older woman . 
i must . look -- how pale the window . 
and you called your friend , and she 's telling you not to go ? when i went to europe my friends told me i was crazy . 
he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge . ha ! ha ! ha ! i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward . you should see him strut down the street in it . he looks like a little boulevardier . you see , count d'algout gave me <person> for my birthday . you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy , did n't you , <person> ? 
oh , <person> ... 
brad ! have <person> or dad seen this ?

<person> ! 
why would i kill my husband ? 
how about that . well , you always were a screwball .

and you believe him ? 
did he have a wife ? did he had a girl friend ? did you know them ? 
is that you , dean ? 
there you are . out you come . 
it does n't make sense because we do n't understand it . 
that 's <person> 's - i 'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary . you better not -- 
neither does he . that 's where he loses . this man 's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff . 
systems report . communications ? 
no ? 
i have a family , <person> . 
your lisa ? 
what ... the hell is that ? 
she still is . 
<person> reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago . that 's why micom wants onsite assessment . 
it 's actually dh-1 digitech pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator . 
man , as man was meant to be -- a vengeful ape who murders . he will soon be extinct . it 's time , it 's time . 
after dropping a bombshell like that , you owe me . big . 
so take his car home . <person> . i 'm sure he 's up to something ... 
it 's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now ... the interest is going up ... $ <number> ... do you realize that , flash ? 
<number> -- 
... <person> is laconic , matter-of fact . the scuttlebutt is that he 's a strong candidate for <number> of the vacant seats on the board of first american . but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man , we 're going to need facts on his background ... ... <person> , what did you come up with ? 
there 's an ordinance against burning anything in this town , unless it 's ... 
well , i do n't pretend to be an expert . 
total control now . tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas , <number> good old boys in a fire apple red convertible ... stoned , ripped , twisted ... good people ! 
<person> <number> . 
you know , that daddy of yours is the funniest man , the things he says , you never know what 's going to come out of his mouth next . 
you 'll always remember your first time . 
yes . 
where -- ? 
this is what we laughingly refer to as a plan , right ? 
my god ! 
... -o of all , wantin ' to be a part of this wacko shit ! 
demure , aggressive , sleazy ? be honest . 
the problem is <person> . he and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the kern a few weeks ago . <person> never made it back . 
when you get home , i 'm asleep . when i leave home , you 're asleep . 
so ... we won ? 
moonby , <number> battalion , <person> <person> <person> , <person> <person> . ex-corporal <person> , deserted . 
alright , so i 'll get more . 
<person> , we spoke with <person> . 
i probably am , but i do n't care . i mean , i was n't that blessed to begin with , and when would i have had time to make any improvements ... 
jake , is that you ? 
we think <person> <person> maybe -- 
of course not . 
nothing 's wrong , i just got some guy on the phone on my other line , he 's says he works for this guy , this guy who 's <person> 's father -- 
<number> -- 
i 'll make <number> for you . i live there . 
ohhh-hh , ohhh ... 
you should be used to that . 
definitely a package you do n't want to open or touch . 
how does <person> know what i like to do ? 
but it 's not totally hopeless for you ... i 've had it . i do n't even have the energy to try anymore . you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you do n't end up like me ... 
i did . 
lissen . i do n't care nothin ' about you , but if you mess in this , your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble , an ' <person> get sent back to the penitentiary . 
i suppose . 
she 's still alive . 
i do n't know what that means . 
sighs . 
it got to be too much for him . 
d'you have to say `` fucking '' every other word ? 
so hawkasaurus , i wo n't mince words ... 
you make me sick . i ca n't believe you 've sunk so low . 
have you seen <person> ? 
i know what i see . i see someone who does n't accept the world as it is . who 's not afraid . i see a women who thinks ... `` what if ? `` ... 
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy , <person> . 
you wrote his scripts for him ? 
what 's that mean ? 
we do n't know how , but <person> <person> made himself into an android . 
twenty-five-million ! and what will they do if the money is n't delivered ? 
what ? 
and that 's when i told you my father was this famous virologist and you said , `` hey , he could make a germ and we could steal it ! '' 
let me call <person> . 
peter- 
... goddamn it , you telling me this motherfucker 's whacked <number> of our witnesses tonight ...

the writings of <person> <person> <person> ... <person> ... 
<person> shit ... 
my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart . 
and what is that ? 
no . just you and me . we get some proof , then tell them . <person> , look ... if was can prove to coffey it 's not russians , maybe he 'll ease off the button a little . 
micheal ? do you have something to tell me ? 
yeah , well , if we 'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse . a key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already ? 
or was it , she wished he was dead - that 's it - i believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid . 
god , the old man would 've loved this view , would n't he ? 
after the kids are back in school . 
yeah , what 'd he have to say ? 
<person> never said much about him . he dies . even before the war ... 
why do i always have to do it ? 
when you 're hitting you should n't think about anything but hitting . but you should n't think about it too much . the trick is to use your brain to not use your brain . 
then , i am lucky . i am still too young . 
i told you . if we ... you know do it , they go away until ... we 're done . 
tell me his name , dr. lecter . 
lonesomeness is something you take . you bear ? <person> , you take it and go about your business , that 's all . 
shit . 
<person> ? 
paranoid ? the psychotic ?

wild guess . 
huh . 
whuhh ... 
dewey ? ! ohmigod ! where are you ? ! 
do you think ? maybe we should call someone -- 
it must be great with a wife like that . 
and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing . <person> did badly on the test , he says . `` he only had <number> more russian words right than wrong . '' ha ! that 's like me saying <person> here ... ... is not very intelligent because i beat him <number> games out of <number> the last time we played chess . 
yup . 
he did n't want to get involved . 
and on <person> <person> , <person> <person> , ceo of <person> & <person> had you fired . and the reason he gave you ? 
no baby , you got it wrong . 
fucked up chromosomes , man . think about it . their parents all dropped acid in the sixties . 
goes on like that quite awhile . what do you gentlemen make of it ? 
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... asking all these questions about the sacred stones..at the time i did n't think anything of it.. what was his name ? i 'm so bad with names ... 
... the ... 
well , in any case , <person> , i 'll send you my book . `` six crises . '' 
nothing is easy . 
but suppose he loses ? 
when you die ... be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle -- 
what are you in for , <person> ? 
<person> , how long have we known each other ? 
what is it , smythe ? 
well , i ai n't sleepy either . 
yes . we had a glorious night together . <number> day you 'll remember and write about it .

it 's probably going to need stitches . 
<person> <person> ? i thought we was going to the garden . 
the forwarding number . i have n't seen you at any support groups . 
do you think i did it ? 
the 'coffee shop ' -- 
yeah , well , i 'm sorry too . it took me <number> years to save up those <number> thousand bucks , and now i 'm broke . i ca n't hardly pay for this beer . not to speak of having my credibility destroyed . do you understand what i 'm saying ? my credibility . so yeah , i 'm sorry , too . about as sorry as i 've ever been in my whole fucking life . 
mother fucker ! 
it 's because he 's too tired to sleep . he has to . 
so you 're telling me this is the 24th-century , and i 'm dead ? 
you wo n't tell me who you are ? you wo n't even give me a chance to help you ? 
i 've got to work . 
yeah . he lived there . and died there , too . 
and what 's the price of their not finding out . 
so , what are you saying ... that he did n't kill all those people ? 
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days ? 
who am i ? 
no , i ca n't ... 
why do we always stay here ? 
have you ever been with a male band ? 
<number> of us left . if we could get through that canyon and lose just <number> , that 'd be quite a fucking feat , huh ? a good thing , right ? 
there ai n't no water in the swimmin ' pool . just a dead tree fell in , prob'ly from bein ' struck by lightnin ' .

yes . 
what ? what was that ? 
run , <person> ... they 're coming . 
i meant on my grandmother 's grave . do n't be so technical , <person> . what 's the story ? ! 
ligature strangulation , just like his victims . a cord , nylon , you can tell by the indentation signature -- again , like his victims . look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in . should have cut it off . 
but i would like to buy you drink . 
oh , comedian . yes . oh , uh ... you 're on next .

i want another shot , <person> .

chick-en . 
let 's not think about what i want . how about anywhere you want . 
i need money .

the queen invited you to dinner - 
fifty-five . 
hi , <person> . welcome to the cesspit . 
how did you break into my office , <person> ? ladies of your standing don ’ t learn to pick locks between shopping trips . come on , <person> ! acting dumb doesn ’ t suit you ! who knew i ’ d found dirt on your brother , huh ? who knew it was in an envelope ? taking me for dead , who ’ d want to make sure it didn ’ t fall into the wrong hands ? 
she 's left . 
that 's right . when i was your age , television was called books . and this is a special book . it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick , and i used to read it to your father . and today , i 'm gon na read it to you . 
i 'm not afraid of his words . 
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader . you employ readers , do n't you ? 
no wonder you jumped in the river . 
well , in that hit you miss : she 'll not be hit with <person> 's arrow ; nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold : 
oh , do n't go , okay ? please . 
gentlemen . good evening .

my name 's lydia . and it seems you and i have a lot in common . 
no , you can tell me straight . it 's okay . just , you know , tell me what you think . 
it 's either a great white , or another killer whale . 
no , no , see , that 's not what i 'm saying . i could go to new york if i wanted to , but what 's the point ? so i can learn how to order a cappuccino ? so i can get mugged by some crackhead ? so i can see , see homeless people up close and personal ? 
i have no money now -- i must get some first -- i must get some . 
what have we missed ? 
you were shot in the head . the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate .

no . if i screw up , i wanta do it alone . i 'll call . 
he 's always got it bad as long as i 'm running in the other direction . do n't be fooled , he 's no different than any other guy . he knows how to chase and that 's it . once he 's caught you , he do n't know what to do . so he runs away . 
oh , but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe , to get to america ! oh , but if <person> should find out ! he is such a boy . in many ways i am so much older than he is . 
we are living in cloudcuckooland -- we 'll never get this done today .

this is n't <person> , my friend . we pretty much running things now . our good day has come .

of course , <person> 's father had a similar sense of the absurd . i remember once in paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next i hear he 's arrested for floating nude down the seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings . well , that cost quite a little bit of `` enfluence '' and `` d'argent '' to hush up , i can tell you . <person> , dear , stop playing with your food . do n't you feel well ? 
how 'd they -- 
are you kidding ? tell me you do n't want a slice of that pie right over there .

<number> me , <person> . i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule . 
i do n't work for you , <person> <person> .

i thought we 'd find a store , get you fixed up and then get you some lunch . that sound good ? 
yes , <person> <person> ? 
this is the official composite of the <number> precogs ?

apparently he was crazy jealous . <person> said they 'd had a fight , <person> and tina . 
downstairs . there must be an extension . oh my god -- 
<person> ninotchka . <person> , poor ninotchka . 
... last vehicle he wrote in was a tan ciera at <number> a.m . under the plate number he put dlr - i figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin ' out the tag number . 
you 're so gross . 
already working on it . 
no ... i guess i would have gotten <person> to hit you . 
what 's he look like ? 
you know , there 's , like , this rule . we get to go home at <number> . 
more fun win battle ? 
how ; we do n't know where they are ? 
<person> was looking for you . 
you need a glass ? 
you know i get calls from back home every fuckin ' day ? ! they think you went batshit ! 
well , <person> was n't supposed to tell you anythin ' . thanks a lot , bigmouth . i knew you were a squid the moment i laid eyes on you . in my book , buddy , you 're a piece of shit . he 's not a dirty cop , he 's a good cop . he just saw his chance and he took it . 
thanks . <person> . 
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but , i mean , that was like - i mean , i have some dignity . 
yoooo , that 's it . you ai n't as dumb as i think you are , <person> . 
get lost ? 
so i do n't call either way . 
or course . you should come over to the house . the boys would love to meet you . 
we wo n't need it then . 
so -- are you making any new year 's resolutions ? 
hiya , kid . 
shit ! 
riddick ... was thinkin ' we should make some kind of deal . just in case , you know , this actually -- 
we ai n't taking him to a hospital . 
then makes sure she continues to see him . gets him confide in her and report to you . 
how can i help but mind ? i 'm constantly humiliated ... just because i have n't money . 
you bitch ! 
i wanted to come by , apologize for coming into your house like i did last night . 
i got to fetch her home ... 
that 's me . 
i want to take this to lauren . she 'd want it . 
i 've , uh ... got ta find , got ta get a phone number in my desk . i forgot to phone <person> <person> . 
you 're incorrigible ! ... are n't you ? 
what ? 
... you 're very perceptive . 
you sure ? 
i thought we talked about that . 
give me some money . 
i rode here , on my horse . 
it is fifty years since i heard that name . 
i treated you better . 
i think he 's weird , but that 's me . 
you got yourself a computer , <person> . 
ninety degrees to the left , i hope . how does she feel about you ? 
how long have i got ? 
at least i 've a backlog of memories , but all you 've got is that book ! 
i 'm sorry . 
you fucking ass-holes . 
but -- 
sir ... ? 
it could make weather ! 
you did , i know you did . 
i have been thinking about this for a long while . i knew this day was coming . i knew someday someone would make the call on me . i never thought about anyone that i had whacked . what do you call it anyway ? 
you tell me . 
whattya mean ? 
what did i tell you . the one who cut him was found in an alley . and the family of the others paid <person> all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance . 
then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control . 
kegan ! 
you ca n't stay here . there 's snakes and it 's cold and you 'll just get sicker . 
i 'm gon na shoot him if they do n't get him first . 
is this , by any chance , going to be a confession ? 
i guess it was a little too inconvenient . so for fourteen years , this stuff flowed into the groundwater , free as you please . 
well i guess ... 
it wo n't register . it 's too big to image . 
for the whole night ? 
sheila , what is it ? ... what are you doin ' here ? 
no , no , no , no . 
yeah ... almost . you want to come up and watch sportscenter ? 
a harmless joke . 
you 're kidding , that 's today ? 
it was my fucking television . 
me . 
why else would she have flown in from newport ? it 's not like she 'd <person> <person> a <number> carat diamond . 
gim me <number> . 
i thought it was my turn . 
yeah , he 's helping us work up a profile on this thing . 
<person> channing is ageless . <person> like a press agent . 
legs giving you trouble ? 
i warned you -- i get on a roll ... 
<person> <person> was a first class agent . a senior operative . 'x ' department special operations . he was engaged in top secret research . top priority . government approved . 
figures . 
yeah ? 
i want my wife . i told you and told you . now i 'm gettin ' tired of this shit -- 
nice to know they ca n't seem to get along without ya . 
routine . 
you 're right . 
uh , no , uh i 'm a little tired . i fell asleep . 
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies . 
will he be back soon ? 
i think i came . did n't you feel it ? 
that 's going well , then . 
now then , johnny-o ; pay me . 
that was extreme ! did you see that <number> guy -- 
oh , all right . 
eddie , i wan na make another picture . when are we gon na make another picture ? 
what was my mission ? to help my country ? but how could i do that ? i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war ... so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it . 
none at all ... we won . 
if it had n't been for you , they would have kicked me off the train . i 'd be out there in the middle of nowhere , sitting on my ukulele . 
how dare you take that away from me . 
oh , that 's just my daughter in the bathroom . 
take it easy . 
you just burned the desk . 
so we go to the bar . 
i 'm sorry you saw <number> of our notification cards . you never should have . 
yeah , an honest tramp-ass ho . but i guess you 'll stick your dick in anything . 
worked both sides of the fence . ask your old buddies in the ctu . 
is that too much , <person> ? 
i 'm not good enough to write it alone . we 'll have to do it together . 
i knew you would n't kill me . 
are you ok ? 
you just drove a fucking customer away , <person> . 
security . 
... <person> 's belt , pointing to the earth . you see it over the rocks there ? sailors consider that an omen of good fortune ; the hunter watching over them on their travels ... are you listening to me , <person> ? 
he is totally crunching on you . 
are we on `` cops ? '' are we on `` cops ? '' are we on `` cops ? '' 
i- do n't know what you 're talking about ! 
it 's desperate that i talk to her . 
i flatter myself that such is the case ; in my line of work it 's plumb necessary . the <number> thing you do n't want is air in the conversation . 
-- jeeeeeeesus -- 
uh , no . there 's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat . 
looks like a storm . 
we did it . 
well , i 'm sure as hell not what i thought i was gon na be . i was supposed to have <number> of those great lives , with everything all laid- out and perfect . i mean , hell -- i was <person> <person> , for <person> 's sakes . did i tell you that ? you live next door to a real live beauty queen . i still got the tiara . i kept it cause i thought it meant something . i thought it meant i was gon na do something great with my life . i thought it proved i was gon na grow up to be someone . 
what do you mean ? 
you assemble this , on the instant , from these few observations ? 
get outta my way . 
and in fact he met privately with the president , though unfortunately there was n't time for a photo opportunity . 
no , sir . 
but then you do n't get to watch the ball games . you told me you were a mets fan . 
engaged ? as in you 're getting married ? 
no . it was n't like that ! 
no , leave it . i 'll do it later . <person> , maybe you and <person> can come for dinner on saturday . i 'm sure <person> 'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all . 
<person> ? 
i have an urgent commpic from <person> <person> regula i for the admiral . dr. <person> <person> . 
i always liked the west , west of il- linois anyway . but you got ta give me time to pack . 
hey , <person> . 
ok , ok ... take it easy . i 'll show . tuesday i 'll give <person> something . i promise . 
just a man . a knight in the king 's service . 
yeah , but i see you moved it up . 
what 's gotten into you , <person> ? i was -- 
beats forty hours on a plane . 
i had you transferred to kigali . 
my special , scrambled eggs surprise . 
good . making progress . 
what was that about up there ? 
that 's good . that 's uh ... good . 
you 're the first one he 'll contact . 
these are beautiful . how 's the case coming ? 
it 's freezing , is n't it ? 
what are you talkin ' a- ? 
you are female ? 
i ca n't hear him . 
i 'll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him . 
all in all , quite a canoe ... 
yeah . 
oh , my ! 
no ... what about your sister ? 
see anything ? 
hello . 
you gon na get used to wearing them chains aftera while , luke . but do n't you never stop listenin ' to them clinkin ' . that 's gon na remind you of what i been sayin ' . 
i 've just got a few -- 
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality . 
what 's the matter , boy trouble ? 
last thing i need is a reason to keep hacking . this job 's a fill-in . 
should never have come out . i should 've stayed there , fought with them . 
mommy ... 
i would also like to apologize . 
i thought you hardly know her . 
hey , slow it down , big boy . you 're making the rest of us look bad ... how come i have n't seen you around here before ? 
i care about you , a - but i just do n't have those kind of feelings for you . i 'm sorry . i 'm not in love with you . 
whose cloths ? your clothes ? 
no . do you ? 
oh , i 'm sorry , wait a minute , i have something . well , what about saturday night ? 
-- good afternoon -- 
who are you ? 
just play <number> set of downs . i told them you were great . 
you can touch me , i wo n't bite . 
what line is he in . 
where to ? 
hi , <person> . 
it 's fine . it 's done . <person> . i 'm just sort of ... tinkering with it . 
any old where ... but not our little <person> ... oh no ! when you 're not thumping them pagan skins , you 're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish ! 
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins , and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags , what did we ask ? 
<number> hundred quid , <person> <person> . 
the guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion , and usually has a book or magazine with him . 
hey . 
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure . only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one . unkillable . but now i believe that is going to change . 
listen , hannah , i 'm flattered , really , but right now i -- 
that 's something a man could do ... ? 
i want to go home . 
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same . 
yes , i know . 
do you think she 'll meet me in rome ? 
do n't test me , you wan na talk about what the law book says , we can do that , push me far enough and i 'll take you to jail -- now calm down . 
i just want to sit here longer , i mean the feeling is powerful -- why 's that ? 
huh huh huh . that was cool . 
well then who can ? 
<person> fettes and i have professional matters to discuss . 
i 'm getting electrolysis . it 's working , but it takes time . so meanwhile i have to ... 
oh -- that phone call ! i gave them your number -- hope you do n't mind . 
jesus ... 
i believe you , brother , but this do n't look good . 
you 're calling the shots . 
easy to fix . <person> <person> <person> <person> . 
that 's right . 
i do n't know , but i can think about it , a lot . 
is n't that what the old canaveral guys used to call a comet on an east-west trajectory ? 
you look wonderful . you do . what happened to you ? 
have you talked to cotton ? 
hey man , welcome to our parking lot . lem me give you some advice , if she asks you to dance , make sure her brother 's not around . somebody blew out <person> 's pilot light , if you get my meaning . 
delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns . 
that 's not true i am a sculptor ! 
if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back . that would have left us with nothing . 
will you just put the gun down ? 
aah , it 's kind of a hike . 
cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap . 
it 's not mine . 
small moves , captain , small moves . 
but i do n't want to go , i am enjoying it . 
dewey ! where the hell you been , boy ? 
melissa ! 
i ... i ... think i 'm ... shot . 
he is ... ? 
he say what they looked like ? 
when we find him , he is mine . 
my brother is discreet . 
ludwig . 
hey , do you have any glue in your bag ? 
get your own room , <person> . 
ah , wo n't you sit down ? 
what do you care ? 
where are they ? 
... yeah ... .well you have me now . 
i 'm serious about this , <person> -- 
captain , i implore you . the men are frightened and angry . they want your assurance . 
funny ? 
so ? is n't the president jumping on your bandwagon ? 
you told me <person> betrayed and murdered my father . 
am i ? 
a spring trap ! 
that 's not much . 
oh , some insurance man . are you in ? 
brill ? 
june <number> , <person> willing , i 'll marry your dad . and then i < u > will < /u > be your stepmom . and right now , i 'm not looking forward to th ... 
why ? 
what do i do when i 'm around someone i know ? 
how long has he been here ... ? 
i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting <person> in his photography , mr lombard . by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold . so as you see , i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account . 
i 'm getting divorced . 

i 'm glad that 's all over for me . 
chicolini , you 've come just in time . we need a man who 's fearless , brave . a man who 's willing to die , if necessary . 
<person> 's an `` untouchable '' , man - highest clearance . <person> , <person> , the cubans - all agency . 
wow , a guy in a chevy is chasing her and some other guy i ca n't see . 
it 's very possible ordell 's killed somebody . 
there 's a kind of a lone shark , called , uh ... 
i 'm frightened , terribly frightened . i ... i do n't know what 's out there , mitch . 
i will see it next time . 
lots of things . <person> , mostly . 
margo - and <person> - want us to meet them at the cub room tonight , after theater . for a bottle of wine . 
what ? 
okay , let 's hear it . i 'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house . 
it 's pretty hard to stay away from that word is n't is ? 
i needed to know . 
you were ? 
jeanne ... let him do it . <number> more dead body 's not going to make any difference , so who cares ? 
is everything getting worse ? 
like your cocaine , i suppose . the `` high '' lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it ... as a reward for our labor . 
not yet . 
does he still love you ? 
i hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband . 
yo . 
gee . you really think ? 
hey , there - you seen my winifred ? 
still got that <number> dollars ? 
make it official , if you like . 
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast , and determine what 's to be done with him . 
there may be a hunting party . 
not yet . he 's near `` m '' and <number> . i 've got an elsur unit on the scene now . a residential building . twelve units . 
but who is left ? 
i have no reason to . 
yeah , maybe , a little . 
i just -- realized that i did n't know anything about you . i was interested . 
... do not accept charity . we are <number> young , able-bodied americans . we do not want a handout . we want a hand-up . give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow . give us corn - the kind you plant , not eat - and we 'll grow our own food and ... and , uh , then cut it , and - uh , y'know eat it ! now , if you 're interested in giving us a home loan , i will sit back down . if not , have a nice day , ma'am . 
you did that deliberately . you knew all along i 'd like them . it was a trick . 
there 's an old saying , `` first customer of the day is always the most trouble ! '' but like i said , i 'm in no mood for it so i 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you wo n't have <number> human reason to give me ... 
what 's all this about sin ? 
i 'll keep that in mind . 
<person> . supernova . 
i love you . 
what 's that ? 
no no no , no no . 
you back this mission , and i 'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or -- 
you know damn well about what . you let them take it out of here . 
what about hard work ? 
well , they 're wrong . this territory is full of bad characters . 
not too far , i hope . 
if i can . 
it 'll keep them fresh . if they get too dry , they 'll break . and you do n't want that to happen , do you ? tobacco is a plant , and it needs the same loving care you 'd give an orchid . 
come on rachel ! 
with me you can always do business . 
but we can live without taking human life . it 's possible . 
that we do . and we put air in the tires . i 'll even sell you some gas if you need it . 
okay , <person> ... what do we do ? 
honest mistake . just give me the money back and all will be forgiven . 
all right . all right -- <person> , just sit tight will you ? i 'll read your report , i 'll discuss it with the others . i 'll be back next thursday , we 'll talk the whole thing over then . nothing til thursday , all right ? 
it 's like she 's waiting for something . 
<person> congeniality ? let him find his own clues . there 's a journal article in this somewhere . 
how 's it going ? 
-- no ! -- not me ! -- no other people ! -- 
do ... what . 
our dimwitted friends do n't understand the concept of acting . they have no theater , no imagination these scientists . 
thank you . 
it was <person> 's idea . 
alright . <person> 's ... page <number> , the fucking < u > horse < /u > dies . you know , < u > she < /u > could be in the movie , she could , she 's got a good face , she could be the doctor 's ... uh , why does it have to be his , uh , < u > wife < /u > ... ? it could be his ... 
i do n't understand . it wants us to play the game . it 's been taunting us ... 
we 're here . 
may i walk with you a ways ? 
i see . 
no . 
<number> flights ? 
< u > there never was a jason bourne < /u > . you have to come with me . it 's the only way . we can give it back to you ... 
oh , do n't be so coy , dear . you 're going to rio . 
they 're coming . 
your juicy , heart-shaped ass . 
mom expects great things from you ... 
that 's for you to find out . 
yes , he can . but i 've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table -- 
you like ? 
jesus , look at this guy . 
so since i 've never had sex with you , by your own advice i should n't accept your advice . 
for the car , for aiding and abetting a prison escape , and conspiring to do whatever you came here for . 
you say something ? 
i ca n't lose him , can you get off a shot ? 
i 've got to get back to the office . 
hold back denver - i 'm fine..you..you go on upstairs . i 'll do the cleaning up . 
playing . 
no way . 
well we 'd like to help you in any way we can . we 're all in this together , as law enforcement officers . 
yes ... i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo . there were <number> of them ... printed on some kind of fabric . 
you have proven that already , comrade skrapinov , you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship . 
he 's drunk . 
how 's it feel ? 
i think you know what i mean . 
maybe you should think about < u > yourself < /u > for once . you always let this guy push you round -- 
i only have a <number> dollars or so . 
do n't push me , <person> . 
hauser , you 're lost your mind . 
thought you were another wife , maybe . 
how 'bout a handkerchief ? 
data ... are you sure you 're all right ? 
then where did you get this not my tape . 
how much did you say it was , <person> ? 
they will escort you to your rooms now . you will be provided with fresh clothes . tonight you will be dining with his highness . 
-- now to recap , i want to stay in arizona , i want my new contract , i like you , you 're nice to my wife , i will stay with you , that 's what i 'm doing for you , but here 's what you 're gon na do for me . you listening ? 
-auditorium nostrum- 
you 're payin ' for my trip , browning ! 
respectfully <person> , <person> and i must report . 
so what 's up ? what 'd i miss ? 
but i 'm <person> ... i mean , i 'm not <person> , but she thinks i am ! you heard her ... stop staring at me ... i 'm not crazy , she is ! 
we stranded <number> runners in the first <number> innings . this will come back to haunt us . 
linda , you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus . 
with a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up ? y'ever read your shakespeare , <person> ? 
oh . yeah . 
why do you want to stay around here ? it 'll only make you feel badly . 
does it feel comfortable ? 
j ’ ai bien peur qu ’ il te faudra attendre . pas avant la matinée . 
oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ? 
yeah . no . i mean , you know . 
hey ... you okay ? 
i feel sure of it . 
i 'm touched . 
so we better get started . 
be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record . 
this just is n't the best moment for this . 
the best thing about soap is that it 's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty . no matter what crap you throw on it ... it always rubs off . and there it is again ... perfect . 
yeah . she was killed in a car crash . her lawyer was driving . she was filing for divorce . 
i 'm talking to you ... i 'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute ! 
this could be it . 
she 's tough . 
no , it 's a treasure map . 
my money ? why , <person> <person> ? what a quaint idea . come over to the door . i want to speak to you privately . stop throwing away that money . we must n't let people see any softness in you , <person> <person> ... . people take advantage of softness , you know . come out of there -- i 'll give you an extension if you 'll forget this stupid repentance idea . 
oh , you know ... a lot of people are n't too old for clubs but they 're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that . they want to hear old funk and <person> and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there 's nowhere for them . 
we toil and labor , we loot and pillage , rape and kill ... and yet ... 
which gives us about <number> hours . why 'd you call me ? 
oh , i do . you made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash . your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized . 
got the information on you ? 
before <person> left , he asked me to be the <number> to tell you , if it happened . 
<person> ? ! 
sign this , and i will confess you myself if you want . 
it 's like war of the worlds . 
yes , they are . 
what 's <person> <person> up to ? 
that 's the idea . 
what if i keep dropping ? 
no , i think i 'll drink it in here , thanks . 
you certainly can . especially if you 're me between now and tomorrow morning ... 
i know , i know . 
no way . this would just provide some stability is what i 'm saying . i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there , you know , keep myself in the game in case something big comes along . 
i think i 'm ready for the show . 
which ... 
yes . i do n't want them . i 'm not looking for analysis or drugs . it 's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis . it 's more than that . i can feel it . i need you prof. you 're the only <number> i can talk to . 
stay as long as you like , son . no rush . 
you killed a prostitute .

i always wondered what the world would be like . but now that i 've seen it , i do n't need to see any more . it 's all right . once i 'm in the tank , i wo n't remember any of this . 
i guess it 's hard working on the road like that . 
if we have any hope for a compromise or truce with england now , we have to hold on here : our men must believe they can win -- the british must believe that somehow , in some mad , impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them . 
lykas , pick a man . someone who will look good . jerses i want it built up in the daily action ... 
but , this could be serious .

we could be like <number> grief stricken students and we 'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly . 
he was ... my responsibility -- my rio . 
sit here , near me . i am an old man and can do no <number> any harm . 
it 's a secret . 
why so briefly ? 
or do you just want me ? i 'm going to let you enter me now .

but they picked me , right ? so what i 'll do , i 'll just say , now look , you want me ? well , i do n't go nowhere without my buddy here . 
'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i do n't hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things . 
he 's still very sick . please come downstairs with me . i 'll explain the situation . 
and then , uh ... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again . 
keep quiet about this . i do n't have any license for him yet . i 've only had him a couple of days . nobody can feed him except me . i 'm the only one he trusts . <person> .

bookkeepers know everything . <person> 's men are all a little too good for the jobs they 're supposed to be doing . they get a little more money than the job 's worth . <person> 's a good man ; he 's operating perfectly .

but you did n't have to come up here . 
i believe the captain feels that <person> 's mission has always been <number> of peace -

well , <person> aced <person> and i did n't quite flunk english so if you want , we 've got our study group .

it 's a good , honest business , is n't it ? 
do n't listen to him , little sister . when you 're proud of what you are , you do n't refuse the label , understand ?

i think now that he might ... 
boy , beautiful day , hey , <person> ? 
is anybody besides you here now ? 
correct ... apparently , <person> is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the adamantium in logan 's dog tag to test it on the senator . and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan 's skeleton for a larger demonstration . 
oh , god . i 'm awake .

can i have some chips ? 
it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet ... it belonged to <person> of smyrna ... he was crushed by an elephant .

<person> , for <person> 's sake . 
sometimes ... do n't know why it is ... i get so hot i ca n't stand it . i just start sweating like a dog . you ever get like that ? 
this is fucking crazy . instead of killing us , he sends us on a suicide mission . do you know who <person> <person> is ? he 's a psycho-cokehead- hitman . a faggot . he 's killed fucking who knows how many people . you 'd need half the force to get close to him . and you ca n't get their help because he lives in fucking <person> <person> . 
i think so . 
about how you live , what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that . you know the eve harrington clubs - that they 've got in most of the girls ' high schools ? 
what 's that , some of your bathtub brew ? 
blue eyes ?

i spent all day crawling out of a grave . the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons –-

i told her . i sounded off . 
... for whatever it 's worth , i 'm sorry i dragged you into this ...

no , i do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to -- 
then why did n't they take it . 
gimmee her number , i 'll have her pick you up . 
i hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . i used to run a lot of dope for him . <person> ' shame he got shivved . 
sure i do . i understand he 's in the hospital . how is he ? 
if you ca n't make it back , i 'll hold up at the douglas shaft . stop worryin ' . you sound like a mother hen . 
maybe i can turn it into a bit . i can go back on the show , and say it was rigged . demand a recount ... 
let 's go look , then . let 's go look , then ! 
for what ? 
i was kidding . people actually live there ? 
not anymore . 
i know i did . 
what are you doing up ? 
you sure this sweet machine 's not going to waste ? 
<person> ? 
you , sister ... 
i ca n't believe you . you used to hate being the center of attention . now you 're proposing , in public , at a benefit . 
do n't believe everything you hear on tv . 
what are you talking about ? 
we 'll have to go into quarantine , maybe for quite a while . 
mmmmm . 
i fell in love . 
modified m-16 a2 and over-under m-79 grenade launcher , with <person> sound suppressor , <person> starlight scope and lac/r-100 laser sighting system . 
you did good , <person> ! 
so , <person> <person> ? can i go ahead and make my travel arrangements ? 
just <number> favor . 
how does the rolling help , actually ? 
we live <number> piers over , do n't we ? number <number> , right ? we 're having like a really neat open house today from like <number> to whenever if you care to stop by . 
hi ya , big boy ? how 's it goin ' ? like it in here ? 
we 'll keep it quiet ; the people who know are trustworthy ... the committee need n't find out . 
i remember . 
how 's the ransom account going , <person> ? 
feel anything ? 
but <person> . you must n't stay there . 
i had a dream once where i was ... there was like , knights in it , and i worked in this bar . and i ... was fighting . i 'm always fighting . and there 's a guy ... he 's not always there , but he 's horrible , all white , and he 's always ... trying to kill me . 
and if i consent ? 
i got what i fucking deserved . i had it all . i could 've kept going ! 
or do you think we 're just so grateful to have <number> of you idiots we 'll look the other way , which is arrogant and condescending . 
cost ya a buck . 
daddy , did ya see that ? 
straight up ? 
<person> <person> ? 
i do n't know what they 'd do to me . 
the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he ! you see , <person> has just become the world 's first time traveller . i 've sent <person> into the future -- <number> minutes into the future to be exact . 
aw , please , sir -- this job , it 's all i got ! 
there 've been some complications , <person> . the chinese did n't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set . and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway . 
<person> is coming to pick me up . 
i 'm not a witch , i 'm your wife . but after what you just said , i 'm not even sure i want to be that anymore . 
actually , i 'm a movie star out for a walk . 
wan na hear a dirty joke ? 
incidentally -- i do n't mean to embarrass you in any way , but i 'm a rather brilliant surgeon . perhaps i can help you with that hump . 
why not ? 
some people do it for movement 
i 'm fine . 
i ratchet your ignition mechanism ... 
it ai n't . it 's part of the lessons of life . i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape ? 
see the cross of the lord . be gone you hostile power . o'lord hear my prayer . 
boy , you 're so perfect you can look down on me ? 
i 'm serious , <person> . this case is important to me . 
here . buy bullets . <person> . kill them all ! 
okay . pretty petty party , is n't it , pal ? 
this . and the gas . 
go back to bed . 
i ca n't leave my job , <person> . 
then i sit back and i think , i mean , who 's to say i 'm not a dumb bitch . i work in a bar , right ? i ca n't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place ... you are what you do ... 
why does he trust you ? 
my brother said you were about to fire me . 
almost right . 
no . 
um ... did you still want to read my novel ? 
naturally , <number> does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but , on the other hand , it is not the sort of thing <number> can simply ignore . what do you think , <person> ? 
yeah , he 's a dangerous ... 
my mama ... so sailor , our histories have been somewhat intertwined . 
we 're into the second perimeter . they 'll be coming out to blast us shortly . i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in ? 
wait a minute . answer my question . was mrs. dickson there ? 
all in the stomach , though . your man might live . 
yes . they travel about , usually with <number> or <number> of their followers to lay the groundwork . the vampires find a community and they feed on it , make it their own . you were difficult to trace , and i think the process has gone a lot further than i 'd anticipated . usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy . but for some reason , nobody here seems to be paying any attention . 
oh , honey , you do n't have to lie to me . ever . you can tell me anything . i 'll understand . 
but , you got <number> children ! 
philosophy . 
i -- < u > hate < /u > -- you . 
you have any idea what kind of position this -- 
that bastard . 
i 'm so glad . 
trouble ? 
no . 
i 'm telling ya , it 's over . we used it all up -- 
i know what you 're saying . does n't pay very well . depends on the woman i marry . maybe she 'd like a bigger house , a better car , lotsa kids , college does n't come cheap -- 
hey , man , is <person> <person> in the lineup today ? 
<person> 's sort of sensitive , i guess . more than most . but he 'll be okay in a few weeks . 
good day to you , m'lords . 
could that be <person> <person> ? 
a good deal of it , i reckon . ca n't understand all of it . 
this is the last place . should n't we just take what we can get and think of something else ? 
`` embezzling '' is such an ugly word , <person> <person> ... no , actually i 'm trying to get a legal brief together . 
you want me to give up , huh ? look , <person> 's in back with the girls . anything happens to me - <number> move - and sal gives it to them . <person> boom . how do i know you wo n't jump me ? 
you living together ? 
you do n't ? 
<number> more time . 
reed 's disaster . you know , i half- think he did this to me on purpose . 
gale ?

a criminal ? 
i told you , elle . i need someone -- serious . 
so , <person> , how long have you been in ? st. k 's ? 
courage , <person> . 
are you o.k . ? 
if i had n't , it might have been years -- or never ! 
what ? 
they 'll cut the cake in a few minutes ... leave right after that . your new son-in-law , do we give him something important ? 
we were just debating who had it worse , us or <person> <person> and his guys . 
he looks familiar . 
ca n't you take a guess ? 
oops , i guess you have n't got that far in your anatomy class , huh ? 
i 'm still a vd man under the skin , <person> . you know me . i 'm a down-to-earth kinda guy , right ? 
what are you writing ? 
yeah . i think so . i just had to tell him some of what i knew . is friday still on ? 
hey , <person> . you okay ? 
barnes . he 's very eager to meet you . been calling us every half hour to see if you 're arrived . 
stay still . 
think there be truth only in beauty , lad ? if you 've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws , <person> <person> has the answers you seek . 
it was hot , yes . 
shit . <person> . that did n't count . 
i worked vice , <person> ... violent crimes ... and i saw every known depravity . i was lost , mace . in outer darkness . then i busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker . when i met <person> she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank . another lost soul . 
you 're very late . 
i see your point . 
no , no , i-i-i , uh , i do n't use any major hallucinogenics because i took a puff like <number> years ago at a party and 
where would i find him ? 
is she dying ? 
utah ? i thought you 'd be going to new york or paris . what 's in utah ? 
we 've already played our cards , major . there 's no turning back . 
i 'm afraid i must , <person> <person> . 
so , are you having a good time on the island ? 
annabelle , i know you miss your mother . so why do n't you say hello . 
oh my goodness ... well , the whole thing is just ridiculous , and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall i 'm going to do everything i can to help you . 
that 's the call that i 'm waiting for . 
just think about it . 
perfect , but i ca n't use it right now , i 've got to get these locks done ; it 's a matter of priorities . 
mentioned it , is more what he did . 
what 're you looking for ? 
scully -- 
<person> then . 
fifty <number> dollars ! 
i did n't say anything special , i was just talking out loud . 
to flaunt your deviance in public ? upon a stage ? 
i 've seen that before . <person> had anyone actually do it . 
aah ! i 've got no stomach for that any more . i 've had that kind of life . 
i 've been here twenty years . 
no , you did n't . they found <person> <person> ' body dead in the snow . 
you sure <person> and his pal are n't coming up here , do this themself ? 
if i wanted ta kill ya , i woulda done it long ago . it 's not like you ai n't given me reason . 
first one 's a trucking company , second <number> 's a private residence . a shep proudfoot . 
the skull is gone . 
that 's okay . 
who is it ? 
`` gritty '' ? is this gon na be <number> of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who do n't believe in deodorant ? 
he was a nice horse . 
okay . i think i 'd better be alone for a while . 
what are you doing ? this is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this ! 
your family coat of arms , <person> <person> ? 
well , that 's something . 
you got that right . now get up . we 're walking out of here .

i 've wondered , <person> -- maybe this don <person> 's got the jump on all of us . i 've wondered -- maybe it 's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me -- 
yes , sir . 
you 're the one with the star-spangled hard-on , not me . 
do n't sulk . what brought all this on ? 
well , i do n't know ! i mean you 're a delicious , delightful , delectable little bird , but do n't you think you might be just a little tough ? 
hello . <person> to <person> . are you listening ? 
of course you 're all aware a king must have an heir some <number> to pass the family name along will some <number> tell me where i 'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong 
i need to rent a cabin . 
you got some guts for a rich kid . i guess you and me could be buddies . 
do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ? 
he will be . in about <number> minutes . 

really ? 
i have an appointment this after- noon . i need someone to take them to the park . 
`` what satisfaction can'st thou have tonight ? '' 
he did n't leave with them .

i 'm not sewing anything else .

excuse me ? 
yes , sir , you bet i would . 
what ? 
is it finished ? 
oui . perhaps i called at a bad time . i am sorry . 
i *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future ! 
and i 'm here tonight and i wo n't let him get to you . 
because they caught me ? 
gosh , in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them ,

was that your dad ? 
you have , my son . 
there are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries . they 're dissolving , <person> ... slowly , but they 're definitely dissolving . you have just long enough to do the job . 
mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes . do n't you like your pretty clothes ? 
it was . 
you have no idea what you 've done to me , do you ? and after you leave , i 'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here . if anything happened at all ! and i 'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some ... housewife 's kitchen in romania if you 'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group . 
whoa-oh ! <person> , i ... 
she tarried around the kitchen after i 'd gone up , and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong ... 
stop busting my balls . i said i 'm listening ten fucking times already . 
are you sure ? 
patrizia , i 'm afraid . 
how long ? 
i did n't know <person> <person> had been married before . 
<person> , boy , you better give me that money . c'mon now , give it to me . it 's mine . 
you 're right . i ca n't stand that bastard . <person> . this is something new . not the same guy , that 's for sure . 
a tag on your toe . nobody threatens me and lives . 
well , i 'm scared , but i 'm not sorry . 
with who ? 
no , ma'am , i 'm not . 
i would n't be seen dead in them . they 're dead grotty . 
<person> , <person> is n't adjusting to school . and she ca n't sit in this apartment all day ... i think it would be good for her . 
i left him hanging around the american express . 
okay , you were right . i hated my column , but i can do this assignment .

couple hours from idaho . we 'll cut across to montana . i 've got friends there with a ranch . 
your mom is the tooth fairy ? that is so cool ! 
i love you . 
it was just like before , was n't it ? was n't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing <number> people to get the <number> you 're after , this time there was only <number> other person involved . 
why ? 
mac 's signature . 
who 's <person> <person> ? 
we do n't know , <person> . we 've been unable to get in touch with your sister . 
yeah ? so ? 
ask whatever you will . 
yeah , i guess it is , boy . just you and me . 
it 's private . 
great . 
... here ! 
daddy , i 'm scared . 
are you questioning me ? 
i know where he goes . 
you know , there is <number> thing i ca n't figure out . all along they 've been bugging me about those files and when i told them i 'd burned all that stuff , they went nuts - they told the consul guy they were medical records ? 
morning . 
next friday . 
this is crazy -- 
i know it as surely as you 're sitting here , sweetheart . she was the most vital woman i ever met . 
you need a lift . let 's go to arcade and celebrate ... your alert successor ... logan-6 . 
and you need n't worry . i 'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know . 
yes . 
yeah , well , his eyes say different . 
<person> . 
i see : he 'd walk out next month . 
that 's not mine . 
goosed !

yes -- very , very big ! 
damn , you 're beautiful . 
you 're late again , <person> . 
yeah . we call him doc sometimes , you know , like in the bugs bunny cartoons . but how did you know that ? 
you 're not a cop , either . what do you want him for ? 
you remember what the doctor tells us . 
we were idealists . 
marty , you have n't changed a bit ! 
i 'll show you it works . 
fuck you . when you needed information , i got it . you did n't care how . 
what about his teeth ? 
uh , huh ... 
no . there 's a bunch a us 'round somewhere ... i think <person> 's sleepin ' . she sleeps a lot , now ... do you want marshmallows ? 
how 'd she die ? 
about the conspiracy ? 
she was old . 
i have lava . 
<person> ' , you ai n't seein ' <person> again , are ya ? 
no , sir . i 'm not going to deny it . but if you 'd just let me explain -- 
<person> beth , i hope you are n't spreading this good news too widely . 
okay . i guess so . 
this will take some time . 
that 's right , we 'll get off at the next stop . the train 's pulling into the station right now . 
re-runs ? 
huh ? oh , no . 
to the diggings i worked at a year ago . it 's a <number> day ride across the eastern desert , near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours . 
' ... detrimental to gaming . and he will be ejected from any casino in las vegas ... and the casinos can be fined as much as a <number> thousand every time he shows up . ' do you believe this shit ? 
who 's the guy , <person> 's boyfriend ? 
give us this day our daily ... 
seven . 
`` the blood tide '' . 
you 're nice . <person> , i 'm taking applications -- how 'd you like to be my palace slave ? 
you 'll try again tomorrow ? 
we can not afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community ! 
you see ... i would n't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends . you understand ? 
so is the woman . 
yeah , but i 'm not sure yet . 
the ideas you get in your head . 
how was chicago ? 
they 've gone to a better place . 
course , it is your business , but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy . 
do n't forget , you owe <person> 's a hundred cartons of american cigarettes . 
a buck a shot . 
no . you gon na give me phony reassurances ? 
she 's gon na be out there , man . right there . right there waiting . 
lay off , sefton . 
that 's swell . how are you ? 
well , i knew you , so i suppose you must have known me . 
fabric and fringe . 
he wo n't leave my room . 
about an hour and a half , because that 's all the longer i 've been gone . 
those <number> psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks . 
is that like an hereditary thing , <person> , or can <number> take classes ? 
for what ? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man ? 
how come you did n't let him shoot me ? 
i love that you 're my wife . 
hi walter . 
thanks . i thought i was gon na have to go to the hospital . 
they 're just eggs , <person> , how embarrassing can eggs be ? 
all right . i 'll give you a few more clues . 
aybe we ought to postpone the opening . 
hell- 
and my compliments to you ... 
it 's an ethnic curl , i ca n't do anything about it . 
so it is going to happen after all . 
now who 's the dreamer , <person> ? even you ca n't fly that fast ! 
it 's kind of dark - 
... if your father were alive , i would be turning to him now . i did n't blow up the american embassy , but i believe some of my people did . my enemies are trying to frame me . there is a war going on within the triads -- and i am going to lose . my name has been written into the book of death . 
gone . not a trace . 
yeah . <person> , he really fucked himself up out here - - did n't he ? 
what 's her story ? 
that 's as straight as i can put it . and do n't tell me that i 'm crazy 'cause i know i 'm not . i 'm goin ' to hell . they 're comin ' after me . 
you start closing again , you 'll be on the board . 
what are you after , <person> ? you want to fry me ? you want my desk ? is that it ? 
he used to know me . 
that he 'd keep an eye on miyamoto . watch out for him . 
who is on this committee ? 
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day . 
i do n't see you scoring any points , buddy . and you 're just the man for the job , right ? 
the `` chronicle '' does n't say she 's murdered , <person> <person> . it says the neighbors are getting suspicious . 
look , it can wait till sunday . 
anybody talk to the press ? 
<person> ? who 's he ? 
you ! 
sure i did , that 's why i 'm here . 
from where -- neptune ? 
clarence , i got ta hand it to ya . you were cooler than cool . 
this is where the fun begins , <person> ! 
about not raping you ... 
i think i 'll cut out here , chief . i got ta get home . 
it rarely has to be done . 
<person> said you was hit by a train ! 
-- his name 's von teer ! his daughter 's named <person> ! -- 
i do n't understand . 
no , tha-that 's good . it 's just unusual . to tell you the truth , so many of my clients do n't . 
a pocketful of fucking rye . what 's wrong ? 
they 're for my cat . i use them to train him not to rip up paper . 
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin . i got to have trust . 
hey , <person> ... man , why do n't you take off your shirt and pants , man ? you should do that wearing what you 're going to wear at the beach . 
as i said , sergeant , you nearly ran into < u > me < /u > ? what 's the problem ? 
you do n't understand that do you ? 
ya want the truth -- ya got heart , but ya fight like an ape -- the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what 's left of ya brain an ' retire . 
do you think guys find that attractive ? 
ever wonder why the dalmation 's the symbol of the firehouse ? 
hi , mom . 
if you know that just back off . 
i 'm dizzy , not deaf . 
<person> <person> , these men who are now with the `` enquirer '' - who were with the `` chronicle '' until yesterday - were n't they just as devoted to the `` chronicle '' kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper ? 
find them everywhere . 
this one 's almost thirty years old . it 's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love . 
well , i 'll be ... 
just sandwiches ... 
i thought you were gon na show it to <person> <person> . he passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me . 
give me the keys , <person> . 
are you kidding ? work is great . i kill at work . i do n't even mind <person> and dad making me pay rent . 
what do you mean ? 
alright i got you , man . it 's my turn for freak patrol . 
oh . 
what about me ? 
tell me <number> ? 
the first drop will be made tomorrow . at twelve o'clock . the amount will be fifty <number> . 
no ! 
we 're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there . 
you smell weird . 
oh , thanks very much . and there had better be something there for us . 
because you always obey orders ... 
work hard , be good at your job . <person> . do whatever they tell you . 
something feels wrong . i think someone 's fucking with me . trying to get me to kill the wrong guy . 
you did n't think i could just leave you ? 
it smells like shit in here ? 
now , <person> <person> ? 
autograph fiends ! they 're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes- 
but dreams do n't pay the bills , do they ? same old reed , the hopeless optimist . still reaching for the stars , with the world on your back . 
what 's it about ? 
up yours . 
i guess if i had my choice , i 'd like to do something that involves children . work with kids in some way . teenagers , maybe . and <person> <person> seems to be full of them . 
but i like the presidential suite . 
`` hi . i 'm mr . <person> ! '' look , <person> , it does n't even hurt him . 
but a good strange . 
yeah , well ... nobody 's perfect . they could n't go doing everything at once . 
exactly . i do n't know what i 'd do without you . 
as far as the world was concerned <person> <person> , the head of the teamsters ' <person> <person> , was a legitimate guy . 
do i know you ? 
well , you know , maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around . 
<number> hours to neptune orbit . 
what for , honey ? you know we can look after you . you 've made the gesture -- 
you were busy ? you know , i really was waiting for you to call me . 
captain solo . what 's the situation ? 
you 're out of your greedy goddamn mind . 
i 'm not accusing you ... 
the president 's in europe . tomorrow he 'll be in turkey . right along this fault line . they launched the space shuttle yesterday . 
thanks very much . that was very nice of you . 
high-grade det cord . this girl , either she 's got strange taste in jewelry or she 's into serious demolition . 
<person> mccoy , what is your current medical status ? 
where the hell are you from , <person> ? ? ? 
are you certain this is the right way ? 
to hear them read <person> . 
it 's not the beer . he just wants to see me fail . 
who is she ? 
i ca n't date her sister until that <number> gets a boyfriend . and that 's the catch . she does n't want a boyfriend . 
smells like piss . is this real , <person> ? is this really real ? i mean we are in an insane asylum , an ' i wan na know how we got ourselves into this scene . 
you go to movies at least ? 
but the phantom <person> is for criminals . 
does he ever talk about medicine ? his patients , the hospital ? 
she 'll think i betrayed her . 
no , sir . 
your parents split up . it 's not the same thing . your mom left town , she 's not in a coffin somewhere . 
it is not stage fright -- it 's something more -- 
i got it . do n't know why i bother . it 's been broken for <number> years . 
maxie ! <person> <person> wha'd'ya say ! 
i hate people with alliterative names . 
are you coming to the party ? 
whoa , <person> . maybe . but we ca n't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe . 
where are you taking me ? 
no , i do n't believe i know anyone by that name . 
you 're kidding , right ? 
this is n't an escort service ? 
... that tunnel . 
that 's why i 'm trying to compromise . what about fifteen-hundred ? they 're worth <number> times that . 
it 's brilliant . <person> thinks so , too . you 'll write a new series -- 'metropolis after <person> . ' 
put her on . 
it goes from <person> <person> . <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> , <person> i , <person> i , <person> i , <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> and <person> , <person> , <person> i , ii , iii and iv , victoria , <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> <person> , <person> <person> . 
you make me feel ... 
no ! i do n't want <person> ! <person> - i use <person> <person> ! 
who the hell are you ? 
hey -- 
what the hell happened to you ? 
<person> , take the exit . 
<person> ? 
on the phone . 
i 'm just saying -- 
you here with <person> ? 
i sprayed your apartment . i took your key . i really did n't mean to do anything but see you . 
so what did we just make ? 
what for ? 
you give me a pain ! 
sure i know maya . 
... the rest of the <number> <number> is still there ? 
no . 
sooner or later you 're gon na run out of things to change . you always do . 
sir ... 
puppets . <person> . it 's the idea of being inside someone else , feeling what they feel , seeing what they see ... 
so this is temporary for you ? 
you 're <person> <person> 's construct . that makes you something special . 
not yet . 
a little . 
how 's the ankle ? can you put your weight on it ? 
ah , to get out of casablanca and go to america ! you 're a lucky man . 
jesus , <person> . you are a medical miracle . the only person who 's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier . 
books ? 
i never knew you , dad . 
how about the `` hell merchants '' ? 
`` save yourself . from hell . '' what are you saying , are you saying that this ship is possessed ? 
st. <person> 's . 
if it 'll make you happy . 
what you going to do ? 
benjamin ? 
that 's fine . 
oh . yes ? just a minute . if you do n't mind -- this is sort of personal 
you know , after doing that job for so many years , you learn to appreciate the simple things in life . flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life . but certainly , you 're not here to chat about my hobbies . 
what is it ? 
you think it 's cool ? 
i do n't need a tuxedo . 
it 's written all over you like a neon sign . now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better . 
scott my boy , come here . <person> was your day ? 
if you have a concussion you should n't sleep . 
whadda we have to do -- kidnap the pope ? 
gasparilla ? 
i wanted to talk to you . the other guys - 
no , no . that 's just something she `` said . '' we do n't have to do that . 
i have no secrets from my family . 
this is <person> <person> ... 
how 'd he know about the treasure ? 
how is he ? 
you ready for this ? i 've recently discovered that our good friend mrs. caldwell is the one who sent the letter to <person> urging her to stay away from me . 
auto-shop 's sealed , but those boys are cut-off . 
i know . 
yeah , mom ? 
yeah , but no presents till midnight . 
i did n't know her . the body i took knew her . the man she met in the coffee shop this morning . i - uh - took him . 
what 's the matter , <person> ? you have n't written a word . 
ah , so you boy 's have been snooping . 
i 'm < u > telling < /u > you . do n't you < u > ever < /u > address me publicly in that tone . you 'll work what and < u > who < /u > i tell you to work . 
an ' if i miss , dig in and try your best to slow the fall . 
tell me about it . 
yeah , it 's special . they do n't make 'em like this anymore . 
but in all that time , <person> , did you ever get off a plane , walk into a room , and find that a source for a story changed his mind ? lost his heart ? walked out on us ? not <number> fucking time ! you want to know why ? 
know what ? 
you can do whatever you want with your own life . we 're thinking of the baby , that 's all . we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby . before it 's too late . 
you ca n't afford <number> ? 
i said another man was buried in his place . 
i 'm going out there . 
veidt . you 're the one who started world war iii . 
that would give us only <number> seconds to revive him ... 
the coach from <person> was there and he has me riding the bench . 
where 's housekeeping ? they wo n't pick up . 
coffee ? 
what ? 
i 'm not going to hurt anyone . 
-- yeah , honey ... 
who did you kill ? 
you 're grounded 'till you 're fifty ! 
and why is that ? 
fergus ? 
what 's he smoke in that ? 
<person> –– bank examiner . 
what ? 
tell them i 'm keeping what 's left . i earned it . i probably killed some poor bastard for it . 
what 's this ? 
it would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical , hardbitten newswoman . besides it would n't be a bad story , would it , `` newswoman saves <person> ? '' 
yes . is molly there ? 
i 'm getting really tired of your bullshit . 
when all this is over and we 're not working for <person> , i 'd love to run into you on the street . why are n't you coming ? 
very well , general , what is it you wish to say ? 
do not lecture me about treaty violations . the federation , in creating an ultimate weapon , has become a gang of intergalactic criminals . it is not i who will surrender , it is you . on the planet below , i have <number> prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon . if you do not surrender immediately , i will execute them , <number> at a time , as enemies of galactic peace . 
i 've been in hiding . i need somewhere to stay . 
let 's talk to your husband -- 
i wonder what time it is . seems kind of late . 
and , to be sure , i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done , and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister , <person> <person> , whose acquaintance i made , as i had so many others , at the gaming table . 
oh , hi ... 
it 's not that simple , <person> <person> -- the lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin ' and we 'll leave it with nothing . 
what do you think this plan is , <person> ? a nuclear attack ? 
what is this insolence ? 
i 'll tell her i spent the night with a friend . 
frances , you 're fulla drugs . you do n't know what you 're saying . who do you think put you into <person> <person> ? your mother thinks you 're crazy and she 'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her . 
you 're a liar . but you upset my plans . 
never saw < that > . not even under an electron-mrcroscope . 
look , i 've left bean on his own . nice to chat though <person> - always a subtle joy . 
you 're making a joke . 
what will this prove ? 
scotty here , captain . transporter is still inoperative . even if we could lock onto the hostages , we could n't beam them up . 
and killing . 
<person> invited me to the party . 
it 's not that bad . 
are you for real ? 
sir -- we charged ! ..gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i can not say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp ... 
i 'm on it . 
you want to `` profile '' me ? find out what makes me `` tick '' ? write about me , go on a talk show , give me a nickname ? 
what about the letter ? 
just that i was in the marines . 
name <number> hundred . 
well , bye . and have a safe trip ... and ... paris in the spring ! 
there 's so much , and so much of it is dull ... 
it was n't the time or place . do n't worry about the note , baby . i 'm playing for my neck now . 
do n't you care what the people will say ? 
good . anything else ? 
why not ? 
the what ? 
where 's that lizard ? 
yeah , sure . of course . 
i did n't do that . 
this life . 
you kiddin ? who else would hack through south bronx or <person> at night ? 
you 'd like me to conduct my own debriefing . 
well , nothing . 
who did he ask for ? 
but you know my name -- it 's <person> . 
what 'd you do that for ? it 's an in- teresting story . all these people are still disappearing . right off the street . hey , what 's wrong ? are you all right ? 
hey -- what about <person> ? 
he knows it well . 
finally , some common sense ... 
yes . 
course and speed ? 
he threatened to kill me . 
what are you saying ? 
we figure out if it 's in here . 
yeah , i got a problem . this is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns . <number> hundred bucks for a pillow ? 
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand-boy . and if you refused , it was n't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that 's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege . 
will you be good enough to look at this bag , madame ? 
you get anything on <person> ? 
where were you ? 
are you hungry ? wan na get something to eat ? 
she told me not to talk to you . 
what do you mean ? 
you ran off with <person> when you were only <number> ! <person> <person> told me ! 
intimately . for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others . i have been swimming in blood my entire life . but i retain a belief , perhaps you will think it old fashioned , undoubtedly you will , but i believe that private lives should not be public property . 
what are you going to be then ? 
it 's horrible , but it 'll be your best friend after a few days . i hope you realize what kind of long shot you 're chasing after . 
barrytown . <person> ? is there no end to your arrogance ? 
you do n't think i can do it . 
i 'm sorry , <person> . 
-- a wiccan -- 
jesus . they look like the secret service . 
the sha-lin masters from east and west must unite ! 
no . perhaps i work too much . 
down ! get down , you beasts ! 
about <person> ? 
then why did i bother bringin ' it up ? 'cause i 'm dumb , that 's why ... y'know , i think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- i 'm dumb an ' you 're shy . 
all right . kisses to you . 
a polish lancer . i was sixteen . 
if you 'll follow me , professor -- 
you like that statue ? 
i messed up , okay , i know that . but i ai n't that kid 's father . 
you 've never said anything about voodoo before , mrs. rand . 
what if someone else buys it in the meantime ? 
it was <person> <person> . he 's come home to kill . 
a unicorn 's been slain . the last stallion in all the country . 
gentlemen , this is n't -- 
well , that 's ... considerably shorter than before . i was wondering , calvin , why set the locks at all . i mean the radiation is gone and ... 
tough shit , bro . this ai n't <person> . you want something , talk to me . 
there 's coffee inside ... i was just bringing this to <person> . 
dickie and <person> , that 's just too good gossip , is n't it ? 
you believe that ? 
a half mill on an <number> to <number> shot . you 're dumber than i thought , lonnegan . 
i would n't have called the boy exactly balanced ... 
uh - - about <number> <number> . 
let 's just kill them . 
what 's got into that cat ? well if you do see him , tell him i 've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him - 
success or nothing ? 
yeah , well , he 's from a third world country . he does n't have it easy . 
good . 
you buying ? 
you have the body ? 
he 's still pixilated . 
you need new girdles . 
it is a beautiful day . i am merely enjoying it . 
what ? 
what ? 
interrogation 's over , bedsoe . 
<person> <person> end up with money ? 
no . they envy you . 
<person> , dinner 's just about ready ... i 've got a surprise for you ... tried something new ... <person> ? <person> , dinner . 
honey , i think that was a mistake . 
i 'm warning you , do n't tempt me . 
slip it in ... 
move away . 
me ? sheldrake thank you for giving that little pep talk to <person> <person> at the office party . 
no . 
what ... what do you mean ? 
see you , <person> . 
this looks terrific , <person> . 
okay . i think that 's all we need to know . 
fuck you ! if i 'm gon na kill myself i 'll do it when i 'm good and ready ! you can go to hell ! 
it 'd have to be pretty good . 
this came for you a couple of days ago . <person> asked me to bring it . with everything happening , i guess she forgot . 
yes , sir . we 're in luck . the sick bay 's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub , a deer with pneumonia , and a depressed gorilla . the apes will be hidden from the public . they 'll be quarantined . if they want medical attention , it 's available on the spot . and the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning . general <person> 's very pleased . 
now you wan na shut up and listen and hear what i got to say ? 
that 's right . that 's a good idea , <person> . 
well , maybe . but i 'd hate to be doin ' it . takes more nerve than i got . 
you will never age for me , nor fade , nor die . 
yeah , they were n't here but a few minutes , did n't really have time to get as up close and personal as i do with most of the assholes that wander through here . 
oh , for <person> 's sake , <person> . 
who ? 
he had access to the keys -- 
you are not in a band , <person> . you are not a musician . and no posters . 
they 're not supposed to be here ! 
we met outside hollywood liquors on <person> <person> . this is where <person> <person> 's booze bills go . 
mom ? you okay ? 
reed 's disaster . you know , i half- think he did this to me on purpose . 
so this is what it 's like to be completely happy ! 
god , just think , we 'll never see <person> again . 
that 's probably in the part <person> tore out . at the top it says : 'i hope we can correspond . ' and then the hole begins . it looks like <person> went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away . 
<number> days to go 
i 'm pulling up . 
yes , i have . 
the high court of israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned jew . ' his passport 's been invalidated except for return to the u.s . he landed in buenos aires yesterday , offered a gift of <number> <number> dollars if they would give him citizenship . they turned him down . 
... where is the back end coming from ? 
does it say anything on the tape ? 
its powers are strong . 
of course i knew . 
i teach these classes i 've taught for a <number> years . the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago . i started off , i was excited about something and i wanted to share it . now it 's rote , it 's the multiplication table . except sometimes . sometimes i 'm droning along and i look up , and there 's this fresh young beautiful face , and it 's all new to her and i 'm this great guy who 's just brilliant and thinks out loud . and when that happens , when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman 's face , and see me there in her eyes , me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was , then i ask her out on a date . it does n't last . it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months , but then she catches on that i 'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she 's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini . and at that moment , she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face , or some action to that effect . 
so how would you put it ? 
the , uh , <person> <person> estate was worth how much ? because her family ... 
you go out in the woods and shoot targets -- whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey 
at last i find you . 
boy , we must be really high up . the air feels so different . 
what is wrong with you ? what ? you 're going away . you 're getting help somewhere . 
your friend ? 
i have work to do . 
i wan na talk to you about a job . 
how long does he have ? 
you all right ? 
the <number> of us are going to do some traveling . we 're going to take your car to <person> <person> . 
<person> <person> ...

come on ! 
you do n't have any problem . you 've got thirty good years ahead of you , easy . maybe you 'll have to cut down as you grow older , get along with just <number> fiancees , but ... 
a friendly competition , if you will . your <person> puppet and my <person> <person> <person> puppet appear opposite each other in a play . not some vegas burly-q pyrotechnics , but a real play that requires actual acting . the audience decides who is more deserving of the title . the losing puppeteer bows out graciously . <person> back to obscurity as a file clerk . 
-- has he got an ax ? -- 
i 'm not going -- you know i 'm not going -- let me stay here ? 
i always knew that you were special . 
we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development , which is nothing like we 've ever seen . 
< u > you want a blowtorch on your daughter 's < /u > < u > pretty face < /u > ? ! 
no . i 'd have liked to . 
mom -- i mean , dad ? 
well of course i 'd want to give her that . i mean , what do you think , i do n't care about her ? 
is there a difference ? 
do you have any other physical evidence , that we can look at ? 
well he was n't really a midget . he was on the cusp of midgethood . that 's what made it cheap . had he been an actual midget , there would 've been nothing cheap about it , my dear . 
then why not give <person> <person> the benefit of the doubt ? 
uh , <person> , i hope i have n't done something to make you think ... 
what about the documents he promised ? 
thank you . i wan na see you again too . and again , and again , and again . <person> , i know we have n't known each other long , but my parents went together all throughout high school , and they still got a divorce . so , fuck it , you wan na marry me ?

this would n't happen if he was with you . i mean , you drive <number> miles below the speed limit . i totaled <number> cars in fives years . 
where is it ? 
-- she was really paranoid , the bookkeeper . 
i 'm <person> . i 'm from west fork , tennessee . my pappy 's a preacher . <person> and his <number> brothers got a ministry , the blessed <person> of the wandering gospel . 
i-i-i-i-i 'll g-g-g-go , m-m-mack ... 
i 've been a newspaperman my whole life and i do n't intend - - if it 's your intention that i should continue to be harassed by this - this - i warn you , <person> <person> , it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but i would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted . 
bobby -- 
oh , <person> of ni , here is your shrubbery . may we go now ? 
oh , you mean on tv . 
that 's what it cost , <person> . 
thank you , sir . although , i 'm afraid i do n't quite see how we can ... 
walk over to the window ... 
so go . 
that fool did n't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill , which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me . 
what ? 
not normal weed . this is some fucked-up skunk class a. i ca n't think let alone move shit . 
why ? you 've made your decision , <person> <person> <person> ! now i hate you ! no , i do n't hate you ; i do n't even think about you ! 
well ? 
is he the one who spread all this blood and misery ? 
unless you <number> wiseacres wan na be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking , what say we drop this ? 
i could n't help myself . you get lost inside a women like her . it was like a drug . it was the best sex i ever had .

i 'm never going back . 
hey man . . . you don ' t think i can be `` cool '' ? you do n't think i can be `` laid back '' like everyone else ? 
i 'd like to , that 's all . girls your age do n't do that . you need an explanation ? 
what did you say ? 
it looks like pixie dust ... kent would 've given anything to see this . <person> , too . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
naw , naw , that 's too much exposure . i ai n't goin anywhere near that money . 
i 'd miss my life ... 
this is a joke in very poor taste . 
not me , buddy . 
i 've come to know you . you 're honest . i trust you . 
just try it . 
there 's <number> - there 's the other , and we 're right between them ! 
that 's not the point . i mean , what if the single is n't done in time ? 
it could be anything . you 're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school . 
you want to hear the good news first , or the bad news ? 
that 's what you 've been looking for -- a farter ? 
excuse me , <person> president , but you forgot to give me my camera back . 
mary , whenever it 's possible , tax- deductible or not , i want to see deductible you . and under any conditions . even respectability . 
... where does <person> live ? 
does it make you ... hard ? 
you think <person> would like it ? 
in a way . 
let us pass , please ! let us pass at once ! we 're with the emperor . 
no , cuz , i rather weep . 
did you go ? 
now listen , <person> ... i sold <person> <person> the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne . `` the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia '' ! 
not much . why ? 
absolutely . when i come back , maybe the <number> of us should spend some time together , on our own . what do you think ? 
you like a little coffee with your cream and sugar ? 
good . 
i 'm surprised you still are . should'a told me you had an a.i . running probes at you . 
you 're in the central corridor . it connects the personnel areas to engineering . 
and i 'm arranging deportation papers . 
pagan symbols . <person> or <person> <person> . 
no . <number> of them . <number> robbers . and they < u > both < /u > get nailed ... get shot by the old lady .

and die laughing , because you 're walking so stupid ! 
how about yourself ? 
i 've been holding this shit for him for <number> weeks . you tell diego i do n't appreciate it . you tell him i want my money by friday . can you do that ? 
lowell , i ca n't afford --

way i see it , it 's gon na take a while for you to get right . 
give me that . i 'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs . 
this car will take me to <person> <person> . i can not go back . 
you the duff that did n't come up with his end when <person> <person> was sent up ? 
it has n't adjusted . 
gossip counts . <person> <person> was right . this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk . granted , it would n't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning , but if public opinion is against her , then it does n't do to appear too close . 
these freaks , <person> , they give me the creeps . and i 'm not the only one . you 're up for review . you and your petting zoo . 
they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning . <person> , that 's what you are —— a weak , pale , half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live . 
but <person> , in this kind of a wish that does n't matter . 
what ... ? 
let 's not even talk about it . 
how well do you remember the lab ? 
... i 'm about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel , my boy ... 
okay . some idea . 
a man may need to do that , and find it amusing ; but a girl is bound by other laws . 
no . no , i 'm fine . maybe i should go . i mean ... i do n't want our first time to be like this . 
i never heard that song . but what did they do ? 
i did n't know . 
are you saying ... <person> is the man who ’ s trying to kill me ? 
would the network really not run it without the interview ? 
it 's almost over ! ! 
oh no ... 
your words , not mine ... 
it was not -- it was <person> 's . those mckendricks do n't know how to act like human beings . 
were you going somewhere tonight , <person> ? 
so what 'd the other guy look like ? 
very nice ... 
which o'higgins do you know ? for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family . 
shovellings out driveways , work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you ? 
i 'm a scientist . i just conducted an experiment . now i have to write it up . 
mom ! we 're eating ! 
do n't shoot me . <person> was actually slinging it over his shoulder ... 
sure , but what is this ? 
i think you must have had a love affair with her ... 
do n't stop , nurse -- i think i 'm going to faint . 
sure glad you did n't let make a monkey of you . 
a massive cardiac arrest . 
he wants to know if you killed <person> <person> and then killed <person> <person> ? 
a bit on the suspicious side , do n't you think ? 
why be sorry ? that 's what you feel , it 's better to come out with it . 
nothing . 
huh ? 
you 're not going to tell me what she 's doing . i thought we were n't playing games anymore . 
as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido -- for backup purposes , of course . we 've been right behind you the entire time . you see my problem : i could n't appear to control too large a percentage ; my enemies would n't stand for it . so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract . of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired , wholly-owned subsidiaries -- 
a hundred grams . 
it 's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way , on mid afternoon . it really is n't the usual procedure ... 
it 's just ... she 's a indian an ' indians ai n't ... overfriendly . 
you can learn from books . 
we 're going to get some food . 
shit . 
we still love you . sisters forever ! 
no , it was a table . 
what ? 
probably . in my case it 's probably a whole building . 
oh ? 
i 've heard of them . 
- it 's important right now that we talk . <person> to killer . 
my firm 'll represent you . <number> of charge . 
i ... i do n't think you want to know . 
epilepsy . 
lisa . <person> ? oh , <person> <person> . sure . would you , uh , like to come in ? 
cute waitresses ? 
hello ? 
drug evasion with assorted perversions 
i called . i never touched you . i did n't leave my name or nothing . 
<person> ? 
buffy , do n't ... do n't start thinking of me as your friend . it interferes with the work , and it ... 
well , general ripper , sir -- i was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ? 
does she sleep here ? ever ? 
it 's from <person> . those <number> arrows were his insignia . it 's addressed to <person> <person> , a patron who financed his expeditions . 
might be all right . 
move ? where to ? 
<person> , <person> . 
<person> to trouble you . 
i want that area secured , i want any evidence secured and i want it done now . is that clear ? ? 
i 'm not sure that it is the plague . 
nag , nag , nag . <person> , we got a yacht , we got a bracelet , you got <person> , i 've got <person> - we 're really cooking . 
i like what you 've done with the place . 
she went into town with mrs. lutz . did they get him ? 
is it sort of ... like a sinking feeling in your stomach ? 
potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun , <person> , sleep , my baby -- raccoon sits in the spruce all night , <person> , baby , sleep -- 
yes . 
who are you calling ? 
<person> franc . this is only the fifth year we 've made this varietal . very few wineries around here do a straight cabernet franc . it 's from our vineyard up in santa maria . and it was a silver medal winner at paso robles last year . 
wait . 
<person> , i think you 're freaking out . <person> 's gone , i 'll give you that . and maybe he 's in trouble . but it 's not arcade that 's doing it ... 
i 'll say . <person> moley . 
we are little more than a sum of memories . from them we reference who we are , where we 're going . without a past we are nothing . this is why you are so interesting . 
hey . eyes on your own belly ! 
i think so . i tried to get into your cab <number> night , and now you want to come and take me away . 
you 're a little boy and you like to be bad . 
<person> <person> <person> . well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over <number> hundred . 
and that chair -- is the particular property of mrs. rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us . too wise , in fact , to live under the same roof . she prefers the village dispensary . 
why do you need a chain like that ? 
you do n't have anything < u > for < /u > her either . come on , it 'll be very . the note 'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks . 
your mother wo n't be going right away , <person> - 
what 's that next to him ? 
yeah , sure i do . why ? 
really ? lieutenant ? 
i said that ? 
what 's the spread on the game tonight ? 
something bad happened tonight . 
i made 'em just the way you like 'em , sunny side up . 
oh , if there is only time ! 
they inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems . it 's like cracking a computer . all it takes is time . 
maybe we should go now . you must be very tired . we 'll call if any new - 
i 'll kill 'em . anybody bothers you , i 'll kill 'em ! 
laurie , i 'll have to ask you to come with me . 
second thing this week i ca n't explain . 
yeah , it 's like you know every inch of each other 's souls -- and then you 're free . 
no , not in the shop . but i can order them for you . 
no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ? 
you opened the thing ? 
that 's what <person> <person> said to me . if she re-married , all the money was to go to the children . 
whoooah ! no shit ? i 'm impressed . 
if these are the random stalkings of a monster , what good am i ? 
go on . 
see if mine are in there . 
<person> ! 
what do you mean ? what 's going on ? 
it depends on what way you want to go . 
that 's funny . i need to talk to you , too . perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room , <person> <person> . 
what do you know about the ear ? anything ? 
think about what 's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at <number> miles per ? 
but first will you please kindly shut the goddam door ? 
we are at least <number> men short , and those we have will be overparted , ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews . my romeo has let me down . i see disaster . 
uh , uh , this is great . i mean , i love e.e . cummings , but i ca n't let you get this . 
some , you were , you were going to make a reservation for us ? where 's my schedule ? where are we < u > booked < /u > tonight ? 
well , i could < u > get < /u > a rolltop desk . 
are you serious ? 
yes you are . you always do . it 's why we broke up . you always hide behind him . 
i am their hero ! 
who wrote it ? 
i 'm ready now . 
the library . 
we did n't ask for your opinion , <person> . 
i wanted to see you ... 
i am riding to <person> myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap . 
i 'll tell you , <person> -- i 've been away for a long time . very far away . 
yes—if he is your husband . 
you got a light , honey ? 
jeff -- listen -- remember the day you got here ? -- what you said about mr . <person> ? -- that he was sitting up there -- watching -- waiting for someone to come along ? well -- that was *you* . someone with a little plain , decent , uncompromising *rightness* -- to root out the taylors -- yeah , and really light up that dome for once . this country could use some of that -- so could the whole drunken , cockeyed world right now -- a *lot* of it ! and when the right man comes along -- no matter *what* the odds -- he ca n't *ever* quit ! a little fellow called <person> walked out with only a sling- shot -- but he had the *truth* on his side -- 
g'day , they say it 's worth <number> grand ... 
transmit , <person> <person> ! now ! 
but they all said it was <person> 's . 
will you come with me , please . 
yeah ... ?

where have i heard this song before ? 
i do n't have to . i want to . 
you 'll probably be safe enough on your own -- 
do you know where he went ? 
what does the old timex say ? 
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away ? what good was my letter ? 
well , some kids ca n't handle it like you can . 
fine . this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group 's activities . 
i believe what he said . 
what time is it ? 
at some point a man 's got to get serious about his future . i 'm sure you have no idea what i 'm talking about . 
i know . just i 'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin ' , and this do n't help soothe me . 
what happened ? 
this is going to cost you , you know . our fees are ridiculously high . 
i know you think i 'm too attached to him , but still . i am close to gary . and you 're the most meaningful person in my life . i 'm going back to the comix place , why should i be killing myself .

macready ... ? 
it 's just somebody 's idea of a joke ... 
ms. tramell , we 'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us .

every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . but with no gold ! the new world proves expensive , your majesty .

bollocks , bollocks , bollocks . have you seen my glasses ? 
paris ? ! ? what are you doing here ? 
i look at you soviet people and i feel ... pity ... superiority . most of your life , your government has told you that <person> turns people into robots who 'd rather eat microwave sushi , naked in the back of a cadillac than hear the laughter of children . 
<person> helburn , what a surprise . in the last couple of days we 've changed your oil , realigned your brakes , balanced and rotated your tires , aligned your front end , and flushed out your entire cooling system , i really did n't expect to be seeing you for another <number> thousand miles . 
i 'm sorry , <person> , i do n't know much about..

but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor , from the tigris-euphrates valley to the mediterranean , are dark-skinned people . i 've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels . i have never seen a native of that area who was not black . 
x21 . come back .

i 'll be back . 
why do you stare at me like that ? 
<number> <number> dollars . 
do i make you horny ? 
... -to a simple thing like ... 
where 's that ? 
must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow . 
i have to address the supreme council in <number> minutes . just the facts , general . 
she needs a little time . 
right < u > at < /u > him ? 
you sure this goes somewhere ? 
you 're sort of a rude person . 
what are we doing ? 
we need to keep moving . 
it ’ s lovely ... 
i just want to sit here and be still . 
let 's just say i 'm freelancing and leave it at that . 
you 're not far from cypher . 
did i ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me - 
maybe he does love me -- only he does n't have the nerve to tell his wife . 
<person> paid for it . 
i have a map . 
i 'd like to . 
that should make her happy . 
-- haldeman i know , who else ? 
just because they are born ? 
studied acting , i assume ? 
well i do n't know what 's going to happen next -- she 's pressing this , another interrogation , another problem . 
that 's right , fella , no hearst paper will run an rko ad until you agree that citizen kane will never see the light of day . 
it 's not the same guy . it should be a self-solver . no bow around the neck , left and body outdoors , completely different . the others were housewives , secretaries , he talked his way inside , killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom . this one did n't have a husband or a boyfriend , no family , temp waitress , <number> arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses , dui , asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head . sexually assaulted . the others were n't molested that way . we 're waiting for the sperm tests ... 
my god , these people mean to go to war ! they really mean it . 
did you do that ? 
and no vampire here has discourse with <person> or the devil ? 
what ? for chrissakes , spit it out . 
why ? 
cotter , i think she 's right . why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes ? 
< u > you < /u > called < u > us < /u > , <person> <person> . 
i did tell you , did n't i ? that i 'd be ready to start the berlin model today ? 
sean . 
why ? well , it would n't hurt you to have a little more fun . i know i do n't know you all that well , but -- 
ted ? are you there ? 
< i > that 's my best friend . his name is <person> . he 's always fancied me ... but too shy to ever do anything about it. < /i > 
it 's more like a mental block . when i 'm with girls , it does nothing to me . 
rather be back in the mountain ? 
are you dr. <person> <person> ? 
what are you doing ? 
but you ca n't let her get involved now , <person> . <person> will destroy her . 
okay . i give you my word . is ever'thing gon na be okay ? are you all right ? 
sandro , i 'm not coming down . 
so i can have these ? 
you 're going to break up with <person> , are n't you ? 
how come ? 
all except <number> thing . there 's something you should know before you leave . 
why should i lie ? <number> was the year it happened . i was twenty-four - younger than you are now . 
there is so little i know . it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored , and fragments of mirror still hang there , dark and shadowy , reflecting a dark image of me ... and yet not me ... someone else , in other clothes , of another time , doing things i have never done ... but still me ... and i ca n't stop to ask why , i must keep on walking . at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness , and i know when i walk into the darkness , i 'll die . but i 've never come to the and ; i 've always come back , before then . except once . 
you think we 'll ever come back ? 
are you perchance a registered voter ? i 'm also a mayoral prospect . 
you wouldn ’ t recall if the brothers-in-law left together , would you ? 
no , thanks . 
anything . 
what about them ? 
steven buggin ' you ? 
that would be lieutenant garber , and he 's very busy upstairs ... 
you ready ? 
i know that . you think i do n't know that ? `` i know that 's a dumb way to begin , but it 's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the <number> of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i 'm just losing my mind . '' 
hello . 
maybe you should n't be working here so much . you do n't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life . 
it 's beautiful . 
i do n't understand . 
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea ! 
leave ? 
aye . 
you see that 's what bothers me . no other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house . the police looked . there was only the <number> bottle . but you say you did n't arrive until after <person> <person> was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death . how do you think it got there ? 
are you saying that he 's ... 
so great -- right ? 
you do n't know that . 
with what motive ? 
<number> me , <person> , but do <number> senator represent the mood of the whole senate or the will of the roman people ? besides , every truce we make with the germans they break ! 
have you finished those reports ? 
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country . 
problem is , <person> knows everybody . 
i might have mentioned it . 
thank you very much . i 'll do that . 
i imagine , right now , you must be feeling a bit like alice , tumbling down the rabbit hole ? 
i see you go to the night court . 
ethan , you < u > ca n't < /u > burn out .

he wants money . 
there 's a name on the gravestone . 
hey , man , why 'd you say that ? ! 
... well , it suits you ... 
sunlight , you say ?

yah . 
that thing is poisonous . 
i do n't want to hear <person> <person> right now . 
kevin , my father needs a doctor . 
does he have to be here in our hair ?

and if that 's not destiny , i do n't know what is . 
hey , anything for a friend . how 's the knee ? 
can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry , the electric dishwasher , the garbage disposal and a nagging wife . 
take it . i 'm doing it for you , stupid ! 
you 're telling me the cause of death on the report is false . that this man did n't die from an explosion , or from flying debris . 
so ? your mom 's car has a cb , radar detector and cruise control , check ? 
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev 's ears to the top circles of my government 
my neck , <person> . that 's the last bag ? 
no . i have the ring . was i supposed to have a pre-nup ? 
you would n't shoot anyone ... 
perhaps it was a wrong number ... 
i have n't been sick this year . i know that . 
says he ca n't walk . 
can i finish ? hello ? can i finish ? ... the united states has graphic images of violence on television all the time , what is that <number> show ? cops ? and car crashes caught on tape ? we ca n't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much . 
have you been in contact with the principal about your job ? 
on accounta you , <person> did n't get to buy off the jury , or kill the judge . he 's gone . once and for all . it was war , <person> , and you won . 
tubbs , these people mean business .

gee , thanks a lot . 
shut up ! she just wants this thing dead ! 
i think it 's badly scarred too . from a motorcycle accident . 
it makes us human ... 
thank you , <person> . the electricity is everywhere tonight . <person> <person> , a fifty-to-one underdog , is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples ' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine , <number> fighting style should be 'the <person> <person> the cavalier . ' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring ... his record is forty-four wins , twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts . 
i think that 's ... { he starts to rise , and the meeting begins to break up ) starling , i 'm sure these gentlemen ... 
just place an x in the appropriate place on the lifeline . 
i would forget about the maneuver . i would just get out . 
no , it 's pronounced aye gor . 
you know everybody , do n't you ? 
when did this happen ? 
careful ! watch his hand . 
how much it there ? 
yeah ... i knew it . but , what choice do i have ? i 'm in the hospital ; they drag me out of the hospital ... bring me down here ...

yeah , i guess . 
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , <person> called from the hospital and it was too late . 
who 's there ? 
`` wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . '' 
c'mon , <person> . i want to go .

oh my god , oh my god ... 
you really are having a mid-life crisis . 
purpre mama !

after you huffed off , <person> lied so bad , i got so pissed off , i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead . <person> i lost my cool like that . it 's a funny thing , women . 
a piece . only a piece . 
<person> .

i asked him what was so important for him . `` true love , '' he replied . and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness . i can only assume he meant you . you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are . 
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up ? 
they also tried using viral r.n.a . as the bonding element . 
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends . 
why not ? 
good for you . why shouldn ’ t you protect what ’ s yours . 
i think you care more about <person> <person> than your family ! all day long the kids are asking , `` where 's <person> ? '' what am i supposed to tell your kids , <person> ! 
i do n't have much time . they do n't even need bugs anymore . they got these fuckin ' satellite waves . they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , subcutaneous , between his eyes . he was <number> of those products of a crossbreading experiment . a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother . you 'd never believe half the shit the agency does . i 'm so fuckin ' tired . have n't slept since that shit article came out . why 'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this ? 
are you guys gon na fill this place with kids ? you sure got room for them . 
whoa . 
shut up , you dummy . who did this to you ? 
i 'll never get over it -- but i 'll always remember him ... 
well , <person> -- have you got the money ? 
and that 's more important than finding <person> ? 
you wanted to see me ! 
finnegan ... 
jerk ... what did you say ? 
once we kill the thing we wo n't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep . also , it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies ; it may be fouling them all . 
i say , maybe you were born older . i suppose you 've decided what you 're going to do when you get out of college . 
you 're not going anywhere , <person> . 
milking ? 
maybe you did n't , but i 'm here to find out about a disturbance . some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash .

huh ? are you <person> 's son , then ? 
indefinitely ? 
who is it ? 
designed for piscatorial research -- the spawning habits of <person> <person> <person> . 
oh , you must be the brains then . that 's right , guns that fire shot . . . make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet . there will be a load of guns , that 's all i want . i 'll pay you when you deliver . everything outside the cabinet you can keep ; it 's yours . 
yes ... why ? 
aw , come on . <person> star . fame . fortune . sex . 
you were right the first time . is this like , solitary ? the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?

so that 's <number> lbs . at <number> a pound then ? 
but was n't it funny ? 
an odd selection , mr case . 
let 's just forget it , i mean ... 
mister , can you visit anybody here ? 
nobody makes a car like them <person> ... 
i know now . 
verbal , i know you know something . i know you 're not telling us everything . 
it is urgent , sir . 
you saw him , did n't you , dylan ! ? 
get the fuck away from me . 
i wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings . 
i 'm glad they let you out . 
'cause it clogs up your heart . 
your excellency , please do n't think me silly , but i 'd love to have a picture of you . i want to hang it in my bedroom . 
what do you think ? 
for what ? 
yes sir . 
listen , i 've got ta run . i just thought i 'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out , say thursday morning ?

i dig my own graves . green water and the white rabbit . put it on . 
no , i love <person> . we had a lot of good times , didn ’ t we ? 
well , you see , i 've acquired <number> of those new mother-in-laws , and we were afraid she would n't understand the whole idea . so we were going to wait till she went to europe . 
we 're holding the workers down below . 
are those my christmas presents ? 
is she responsible for the punch ? 
my friend <person> was just here . 
they wo n't . 
that 's it ? no number , or instructions ? 
mary -- you 've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and i believe he wants me to help you a little . you see , sometimes we think we 're licked in this life -- but we were n't put here to be licked . do n't you believe it . sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight . now i was thinking before you came , of coming over to <person> <person> end of the month , to get acquainted with my godson -- and other things . 
very talented son of a bitch . too bad we ca n't kill him . 
what would he think ? 
the thing that 's so irritating is that now i 'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses . 
forget about it . 
<person> ? 
-- and i 'll get 'em . 
do we have a deal ? 
get with what ? 
are you out of your vulcan mind ? no human can tolerate the radiation loose in there ! 
he will . but it 's up to you to reawaken his feelings . you 've got to be fabulous , look , think and appear fabulous . and <person> 's given you that chance . you can use the breakfast show to knock <person> dead . 
it 's <person> <person> <person> , is n't it ? 
do n't bend back like that . 
oh , shit . 
you 're gon na pay for that , <person> . what ? ! 
it 's a big religious thing with her and she wo n't even discuss it . 
that 's <person> <person> , the gag king . 
oh , <person> . this is n't about money . it 's about decency and purity . it 's about <person> 's values . 
what happened ? 
hey ... let him out !

good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ? 
ramón -- you ca n't . 
we < u > are < /u > alone - you and me and everybody . but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them , too . someone we do n't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us . and the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there . we are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely . 
<person> , are you trying to steal this car ? 
oh , my gosh . 
good . that way i 'll see more of you ... where are you going to stay ? 
i heard a strange sound ...

i know that . 
uh , well , i 'm a little nervous , i never did a person before .

yeah , fish live in the present . they do n't dwell on yesterday and they do n't worry about tomorrow . even when a big fish attacks a little fish , there 's no neurosis involved . no guilt afterward . no whining on some fish-shrink 's couch . they just do it . they accept . 
awww , he 's so cute . what 's his name ? 
do you want me to tell you what it was like , reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing <person> ?

what can i do for you , gentlemen ? 
you know what i think about , <person> ? 
straight rotation , no shit , call your shot . 
will i be ? 
<person> . you okay ? 
you always manage to avoid the issue : what 's wrong with our present condition ? we 're comfortable and we have plenty of food ... i feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat . why incite trouble ? you should examine your emotions . it is senseless ... 
look , are we going to do it or not ? 
you 're a good soldier , <person> . 
it 's your father . <person> . your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack . 
can you give me a drink , please ?

like i was sayin ' you do n't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer . 
it 's nice to meet you , <person> . 
that 's not what they 're tellin ' me . 
yes , we call them that too . <person> , here we are , <person> ...

there was a mistake . 
that 's it . you 're that policeman with friends in low places . tell me , how 's guissepe torres doing these days ? those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer -- 
save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we do n't want you to run up <person> <person> 's phone bill . 
the boats are all going . 
he has -- something . a funny little quality i find -- 
there are <number> <number> people down there . we 'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions . the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings ... 
she did n't seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . <number> night we went to bed ... the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes . 
baby , c'mon , all this stuff ... i have n't gotten you anything -- 
would you , <person> <person> ? 
i would n't bring you here on a hoax . <person> confirms the telemetry and i.d . codes . 
no . 
it 's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing . it 's kinda cool . it 's like you 're in on some kind of secret . you tell a chick you 've been some place , it 's like bragging that you know how to find it . the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there . you have to have someone come before . there is a direct line connecting you back to the original , unequivocally cool , club patrons . it 's kinda like <person> ... 
yeah ? 
calm down , <person> <person> . she seen a doctor ? 
too far ? 
in any case , you 've got to recover chimera and bring it to us . 
that boy always does great . he 's a corporal or a squad leader or something , just wrote me from some place called <person> <person> ? 
they changed <person> 's portrait . 
you may be right - i sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - 
<person> ! where 's <person> ! 
do you know dr. <person> <person> ... ? 
he 's planning a job . 
he 's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink . 
so you 're not a fruit ? 
so what is it , <person> ? what brings you up here ? 
how ? 
us is over . you had your chance you blew it . 
why not ? you stink . 
they 'll love that . 
that 's the way he is . 
it 's all right , the important thing is you 're safe -- 
aye , sir . 
she 's only perfect . 
look , co ... 
yes . it 's called accountability . 
you 've been listening in the whole time ? 
i dunno . just funny-looking .

what happened ? 
you 'd be great , just great ... 'cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an ' all -- but the fact is that there 's a spacious- '' non-time kind of time '' to it ... 
no ... metropolis is a confusing place . back in smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple . people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand .
